"tbh even anhedonia is kinda a broad term if we could give more specifications this survey would be very helpful 
For example differentiating whether meds helped with motivational anhedonia/consummately anhedonia/emotional numbness

There’s also some sort of bias I don’t know if it has a scientific name but it’s when people take drugs that make them feel better but they don’t really treat the symptoms for example some people could feel high on opioids/stimulants and say they improved the anhedonia but in fact they just masked it.

"My DBT therapist turned me on to a psychiatrist/author Maurice Fava, who writes on Eaudomonia, the opposite of anhedonia. It's interesting stuff, because anhedonia can be terrifying. 

I've been in treatment for depression since 1989 (bipolar I, but my main symptom is depression), and my antidepressants would ""poop out"" from time to time, which left me in a complete state of anxiety, terror and of course anhedonia. 

In recent years I've learned that I can work out when I'm in this state. I listen to music while exercising, and also read between reps. 

While these activities that normally make me feel great don't do that when I'm depressed, I DO feel better and have symptom relief during the exercise itself."	phrresehelp	reply	na	na	na	0.005833759903907776	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"No you misunderstood me I'm not discriminating controlled drugs at all. I understand very much they can actually be used therapeutically and help some people with anhedonia / depression

What I was referring to is a different matter. Anhedonia as I understand it. It isn't just the inability to experience pleasure/emotions but more accurately it's the inability to experience them from things that are supposed to produce pleasure/emotions. So basically I saw some people with anhedonia feeling high on stimulants / opiods.. Etc They still have anhedonia in the sense they still can't experience pleasure from their hobbies but because these drugs are improving their wellbeings (feeling relaxed high..etc) they rate them high and they are effective but they aren't actually treating the condition.

This bias is a little dangerous because you will learn to rely on feeling good from the drugs but ideally theese drugs should enable you to feel good from other things and not from themselves directly. Like I said this doesn't apply to everyone some people on these drugs actually get anti anhedonic effects and feel good from other activities but others are just masking the issue"	phrresehelp	reply	na	na	na	0.005833759903907776	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"When I take half a mg of Xanax I go from curled up in the bed plotting the best way to kms in the next few hours to taking a shower, putting nice clothes on, going for walks and talking to neighbors and making plans for the future. It's the only thing that makes me feel like a normal functioning human being without being intoxicated. 

I've tried all the anti-depressant classes and they don't do anything for me. Xanax is it. It gives me energy and drive and I can only imagine this is what normal people feel like. But because it's so dangerous I never take it more than once a week. Oxycodone also does the same, completely lifts my depression and makes me productive (I don't take it illegally, I have medical issues that lead to me getting surgery like once a year and I only take it as directed for post-surgical pain until it's gone). 

Because of these experiences with these drugs and my dominant symptoms of anhedonia and avolition I can only come to the conclusion that my dopamine system is just fucked and that these drugs that work on serotonin or norepinephrine are just completely irrelevant to my brain's issues. 

With this in mind, do you have any recommendations for long-term, sustainable drugs I could take that would give me the same sorts of results I get from benzodiazepines and opiates to treat my anhedonia/avolition?

"It’s difficult to say if your response to benzodiazepines and opioids has any relevance to your likelihood of responding to particular antidepressants. There’s really no good way to know what will work vs what won’t until you try.

Here are a few options off the top of my head that you could discuss with your doctor though.

Mirtazapine, bupropion and tricyclics can be helpful for anhedonia/avolition. Pramipexole or low-dose Cariprazine or aripiprazole are also helpful ‘dopaminergics’ either alone or as add-ons to other medications.

It might also be worth looking into mood stabilizers if typical antidepressants aren’t working. Lamotrigine could be worth a try. 

Otherwise, if its mainly anxiety and the behavioural inhibition that can come with that then one option could be gabapentin or pregabalin. They have their own risk of dependence but it’s arguably less severe than that of benzodiazepines or opioids and typically have less side effects."	6FeetBeneathTheMoon	reply	na	na	na	0.0013690346386283636	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens
"Benzos can make a shift in your default mode network and get you out of that grut you're usually stuck in your head which stops you from living life. But why are you stuck in the first place?

Check out ketamine treatment and psychedelics (psilocybin). Might help you discover what deep inside yourself keep you stuck in the grut.

There is a gaba hypothesis for depression. Some people’s depression, similar to anxiety, may be caused by low gaba levels which is the neurotransmitter in the brain xanax acts on. I recommend trying something like gabapentin, lamictal, valproate, and other medications that increase the gaba neurotransmitters. However, there are some non-gaba drugs that might help if it’s anxiety. Personally, I have had some success with doxepin, hydroxyzine, and some people respond to buspar. If your an anxious or bipolar depressive, treating your anxiety or mood could really help. The risk with gaba drugs is a higher incidence of tolerance, addiction, and making the underlying problem worse in the long run. Unfortunately, it can’t always be helped. I am one of these people who has had no choice, but to take them and try to live a normal life. I do take a non-gaba drug that helps me as an add on as well.	6FeetBeneathTheMoon	reply	na	na	na	0.0013690346386283636	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens

Clomipramine is a more potent SERT inhibitor, and slightly less potent as an inhibitor for NET. It's just generally more potent in every other respect, with a few exceptions. Imipramine is essentially the baseline TCA, and you're not wrong to think that clomipramine is generally a more potent drug all around. This also means it's more prone to inducing the typical TCA side effects (I was quite happy taking a TCA, but 20+ hour urinary retention isn't negotiable). It could just be a case of the doctor starting with the TCA with the appropriate effect profile for your symptoms and fewest side effects, but really, there's no harm in asking them this question. Some doctors just have favoured drugs, and will typically start with these.TCAs are a cluster bomb approach; they work, but there are unintended consequences. This is far preferable to a drug which does shit all, but I can see why doctors would default to the slightly more targeted of the cluster bombs.

"Hello!

Wellbutrin was very stimulating for me and helped me so much, but the side effects were too extreme and I believe it was allergic to the med. 

This am was my first time taking Effexor and Vyvanse. I took them about 3 hours apart. Taking Effexor at 8 am and Vyvanse at 11 am.

I noticed after taking the Effexor I got kinda sleepy and didn’t feel stimulated or energetic at all. 

I’m wondering if I should keep trying it in the am, or try night time dosing. I do struggle with insomnia normally, so I don’t want the night time dosing to mess with my sleep.. but also don’t want to be fatigued all day. 

Did anyone begin feeling the stimulating and motivating effects by continuing to take the Effexor during the morning? Or did you feel the stimulating motivating effects more after switching to night time dosing?

Did you quit taking Wellbutrin immediately before starting these new medicines? The sleepiness could just be some minor withdrawal from that. Consider taking the Vyvanse as early as you can, especially if you experience insomnia. Effexor itself is mildly stimulating, I would avoid nighttime dosing.	aryastark2626	reply	na	na	na	0.00314921117387712	no	no	strong	na	depressionregimens
"This is because your dose is beginning dose for effexor. At that level effexor basically acts like a mild ssri. And each dose increase will change its effects. @75 it is a ssri but you will start to feel its stimulating effects, @112,5 you will perceive it is an SNRI. @150mg NRI effect will almost fully be active. It may be better for you to avoid night time dosing, when you change to 75 mg. (though it depends on how you gonna react)

"wow very similar to me, Wellbutrin (what a brilliant marketing name they gave as the proprietary name of the drug haha) was One of the first antidepressants that actually fucking worked but unfortunately I developed hives from it and apparently I just have an allergic reaction to it; and, no it's not anything to do with excipients - it's the active.

basically they were afraid that it could cause such an allergic reaction where it could close my throat up and stop me from being able to breathe.

That's why I was taken off of it Even though I actually continued to take it in lower doses for a little while after but I realize it also had some drawbacks because I kind of became more of an asshole when I was on Wellbutrin to be quite honest with you.

yeah I've been on and off Effexor (another brilliant marketing name for the proprietary name of the drug haha) for years and currently I'm actually off; but, possibly maybe restarting back on 37.5 mg; and, I've been on that dose as well as 75 mg, as well as 112.5 mg, as well as 150 mg, and, as well as 225 mg.

and I must say that I do agree that on all different dosage levels there are noticeable effects at each level and I still have not pinpointed exactly where I lie at or even if I want to continue taking it as I am more interested now in psychedelics and I have been doing ketamine infusions for a while even while taking the antidepressant which is how it (ketamine) is recommended to be used."	aryastark2626	reply	na	na	na	0.00314921117387712	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"Call it what you like, “They” gotta label you

 Ok so I’ve been told I have melancholic depression, anhedoniac depression, apathetic depression, major depressive disorder, clinical depression, refactory depression, treatment resistant depression… does it really matter what it’s called. Must the psych crew label me/us with a specific term? I don’t care what term you use, I just want to be better. I, like most of us here have been through the gambit of SSRIs, SSNRIs, antipsychotics, to no avail. Like most everyone here I feel no joy, happiness, wanting, liking, desiring, hope, interest, dreams, food is bland/tasteless, music is empty, life is like a big void, or winter, where the clouds are grey, trees are grey, and the snow is grey.  I am very much at the end of my rope, so I told my psych that “ insanity is defined as doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results” I mentioned Nefazodone and she said she wouldn’t prescribe it because it because of the potential of liver failure( very rare, one in 250,000 patient hours) so I am upset, I asked her if it was better to take the risk and try what may be literally a life saving medication or just be dead. I am willing to try anything that may get me out of this hell hole.  I also mentioned MAOIs which she also balked at. Has anyone tried Nefazodone? Comments?  I can’t do TMS, ECT, or Deep Brain Stimulation because of having a mechanical aortic heart valve. I realize it may be time to get a new psych but I am from  rural NW Pa and am 2 hours away from the nearest decent city (Erie) so it’s slim pickings for a new Dr. Any comments, thoughts? It’s like treading water in the ocean, we keep doggy paddling but more and more I think it be easier to give up, the quandary is, I don’t want to hurt those around me to have my own pain go away.

It actually matters a lot what they call it, or more accurately define what it is. Depression is a heterogeneous disease, it differs from person to person. Defining the characteristics of the different types allows targeting drugs to those types. This will help make treatments become available to those who don't have them now and are treatment resistant. The serotonin approach has worked for maybe 40% if I recall and those were developed when depression was less well understood. Now they are breaking down the condition and trying to understand what is going on in those 60% who don't respond. The better we do that the more likely we will get a drug that helps them. We need to know what is different in those 60% to be able to target them. It is much harder to target a drug for them if we don't have something to go on that we can potentially target at a biological level. Otherwise it becomes a shot in the dark which is less likely to work and a lot of companies are reluctant to do that if they don't have an underlying justification of targeting some system. Sucks being labeled I know, but this is actually a good thing that hopefully will result in a brighter future for those of us in the 60%. I feel your frustration though, I just want to be better and would be happy if I could get at least a little bit better but hasn't happened yet.

"All we know how to do or have enough energy for is survive. That’s worth something, even if we don’t feel like it is. 

I’m right here treading water with you. But, always remember that at no point will you have “tried everything”. There is always hope. There is always someone who somehow had it worse than you and got better. 

You have absolutely no idea what could happen in the future. You might stumble upon a helpful treatment plan on accident. A new med might come out. You might find a doctor that lets you try the laundry list of medications out there that you haven’t tried yet. You might find a lifestyle choice that is extremely helpful to your specific brain. 

Or, an asteroid might hit the earth tomorrow and we can finally be done with this shit, lol. Why not stick around and find out? Worst case scenario, you never get better, you die and go in the dirt like everyone else on the planet and take it from there. No need to rush the process when there’s an undeniable statistical possibility that you find whatever it is that your brain needs to move forward. 

Mental illness is so impossibly convoluted and individualistic that finding your personal correct combination of treatments is a very long, frustrating and seemingly hopeless task. Everything seems like it’s working against you, and to top it off, the unavoidable negative outlook can be making you worse. 

I know that life feels like a sick joke and an unconquerable battle for a lot of us. But try to hold on to the idea that you could be one of those people that you always see online saying shit like “I didn’t think it was possible, but after 45 years, I finally found something that works”, and stuff like that.

First language isn't English, sry:p thank you for taking time to read! I appreciate it alot!

Short version: How to work on self discipline so that you don't fall back in old ways/""lazyness"" even tho you get severely depressed in cycles+ADHD inattentive.
(Ideas on a schedule for example?)

Im at point where I just NEED to do better, I wasted 7 years of my life on opioid and stim abuse and previous 5-6 years on depression with an equally bad lifestyle. I live in a ""rehab"" with only treatment being urine tests. Can not work or study at this point which is my no1 priority.

I keep going thru this cycle:

1. severe depression, self hate, BDD to the point of not leaving my room. Extreme Social anxiety(probably due to my body dysmorphophobia) 

2. I get better one day and back to shit the next for a while, a week mby

3. It gets much better and slightly hypomanic sometimes I think. I feel like ""next time I won't let the depression take control over my actions""  and really believe it

 I start writing down good things that I try to do every day. Trying to adapt to future ""work-life comeback"" and just as I feel like I could start working again and feel functional it just goes back to stage 1..

They think I'm bipolar or borderline personality disorder. They have not been able to diagnose me yet due to former stimulant/opioid abuse(1 month sober) these cycles did NOT appear only after starting drugs btw

I don't know I feel like Im autistic to a degree too, especially the thing with eye contact and geeking interests to death:P but can just be my social anxiety and being an introvert talking..

 I have adhd, depression, general anxiety disorder and BDD diagnosed btw. 


I keep having ""relapses"" in behaviour and mood kind of like a bipolar, and I dont want to go so low in mood again that I fuck up my routines  or start doing drugs again.

my doc suggested to try out Abilify after dozens of other medications have failed. I am a bit scared of it because my association with neuroleptics = apathy, sedation, being like a zombie

"So I was recently officially diagnosed with bipolar and put on abilify 2mg about 2 weeks ago. I wasn’t depressed when I started taking it (I believe) and was actually only prescribed it to prevent mixed episodes, not for any mood lifting effect  (though the dose is ridiculously low for that I think so idk what the psych is thinking) 


I said all that because I’ve been doing so much more stuff now! Before the abilify I would practically do nothing except hate on myself for not doing anything. Now I’m studying daily, doing chores without too much of a hassle, exercising more, and have been sticking to a sleep routine (as much as I sometimes don’t want to sleep, I have been doing it fantastically / forcing myself to go to bed) 


So yeah, I wasn’t even prescribed it for depression but **it’s helped with my behavior more than anything else, even more than any effect on my mood**

Oh and I have more energy now. Nothing unbelievable at all but I am able to do things like study whereas before I felt way too tired to. 


But keep in mind the diagnosis is bipolar so I’m not sure if what I’m experiencing could be Euthymia, which is a period in bipolar where symptoms aren’t present, though I doubt it because although I wasn’t depressed, I was feeling pretty shit and it was getting progressively worse.

"So my anhedonia & blunting issues began a year ago,  1 month post covid after an alcohol hangover and a reaction to caffeine. Anyways thats not my focus, my focus here is my reactions to things ive tried and how I can use my + and - reactions to try to find a solution.

I will not be trying SSRI/SNRI/TCA as they are known to create anhedonia and blunting which are my primary symptoms along with sexual issues. I absolutely do not want to risk reducing the little libido I have either unless the benefits to anhedonia/blunting are potentially massive, and those do not fit that. Standard serotonergic treatments have very high risks for someone like me who is sensitive, they create lasting issues even in those less sensitive than me. 

I am also on TRT+ occasional HCG/Preg but have been for years even way before these current issues that came overnight. I do not notice any fluctuations in my current symptoms from this at all, I can skip T or inject more T and anhedonia is unchanged (though I have never gone above physiological ranges). And otherwise hormone tests look fine, cortisol is like 18 on the range of 4-20. 


Overall what I have noticed is I am incredibly sensitive to NE (but not precursors). Dopaminergics that don’t affect NE though help. Conventionally there is almost nothing that does this though. 

Now to effect of what ive tried:

Helps:

Tyrosine/Mucuna - slight lift

Chamomile Tea - slightl lift

Bromantane - Inconsistent but when it works helps like 30%. I noticed Bromantane is classed a stim, but does not affect NE. 

MIF 1 - This is a dopamine PAM and opiod antagonist it also helps 30% or so

Methylene Blue - MAOA inhibitor which helped quite a bit maybe 40% until tolerance. 60 mg a day. So im not sure how strong it is at MAOA vs other effects like antiinflammatory antioxidant 
 
Pregabalin - 200 mg helps like 80% but started giving horrid rebounds 2 days later even taking every 3-4 days.  1 day later is an afterglow though. 

LDN - 1.5 mg at night gives subtle positive effect in the morning 

TAK-653 - This one is an exception to stims messing me up. Its an RC but it helped like 80-90% randomly at 2 mg twice. But its not consistent and stopped working. It is an AMPA PAM, does not affect NE

AlloP drops/Etifoxine - Amazing the first time I used it almost got to 80-90%. Did not last and does not work that strongly again. 

Rifaximin - SIBO treatment helped while on. Doesn’t last after, though caffeine sensitivity gets better for a few weeks

Did nothing:

Saffron

L tryptophan

Guanfacine - Lowers anxiety but does not help blunting. After 3 days lowers my motivation 

Pregnenolone — Tried 50-100 mg oral, don’t notice too much

Hurts:

Ketamine- ive done 2 infusions back in January. The first one didn’t do much but 2nd one made me more numb for a whole week

Caffeine- Blunts me even more for days. Even decaf sometimes has done it for a day

DLPA - at 600 mg blunted me horribly for days. I suspect it was from the PEA stim effect, as tyrosine or LDN has no issues

Parnate - 5 mg just 2x had a stim effect that resulted in the worst blunting. I felt libido and interest go up acutely but very very robotic and the latter lasted longer for 3 days. 

I have a major sensitivitity it seems to NE and it gives me blunting. Dopaminergic pure stuff is ok. GABAergics also help. 

Are there basically no conventional options? It seems like everything we have targets serotonin and NE. 

I am considering maybe Nardil, if the GABA can outweigh PEA."	caffeinehell	post	26.470462184709483	female	White	0.9892269372940063	na	na	na	23	depressionregimens

I think that the LDN is worth experimenting with since you had good results. I’ve heard of people having to go up to dosages of 7.5mg in order to get effects. I didn’t have much luck with LDN but had the opposite problem (wanted blunting).
I didn’t really notice many effects from PEA tbh.

I had anhedonia+blunting symptoms, restlessness, cognitively off, terrible nausea. This took a week to resolve. But then I had a drink with a lot of caffeine in it and then it triggered the emotional blunting, nausea again from the stim effect. The next morning I also woke up with the anhedonia again.

"Very interesting.

How do you know that Covid had anything to do with this? Or did you just put the pieces together yourself because long-Covid is technically a thing and it fit your narrative?

And I’ve never heard of caffeine doing this, but I don’t doubt your experience.

And although I do understand the alcohol part, I had preexisting issues before that incident and I feel like that’s not your same experience. I feel like it amplified the effects and maybe added some new issues, but I can’t fully blame my condition on that night of drinking. I’ve recently made progress after understanding something new about myself…

Have you been tested for OCD? I have OCD tendencies, and some people don’t realize that they have it because they fail to realize that their obsession over certain perceived ailments is actually *causing* the ailments themselves. 

So, your anhedonia is very real, but it’s possible that the effects from that hangover, caffeine or covid kinda snowballed on you and took you deeper into the hole.

So, let’s say you had lasting minor cognitive effects from Covid, which is certainly possible. Then you had that brutal hangover, which can also cause extremely negative symptoms that are worrisome. Then the caffeine thing.

The effects of these things were very real, but the underlying concern about these things planted a seed in your head and you have been so concerned that you’re permanently damaged and have to feel that way forever that you’re actually *making* yourself feel that way. 

Again, this is not to see that what you’re experiencing isn’t real; it definitely is and I know you’re not making any of this up.

That said, it’s entirely possible that undiagnosed OCD has physiologically programmed your brain to be overly obsessed and focused on these things, which has created its own monster.

I know the feeling of having a sudden sharp, negative alteration in brain function due to one of these types of things and it’s terrifying for some of us because we immediately assume that something irreversible has been done. So, with that idea planted in our brains, it’s so much more difficult for these things to actually pass naturally like they do for other people without OCD, and our obsessions over trying to fix it end up simply making it worse because we’re not understanding the physiological root of it all and have attributed feeling this way strictly to the events that we perceive have caused all of this.

"Covid I don’t know for sure if it had anything to do with it, although it probably caused my SIBO by disrupting the gut anyways which may have made me susceptible to the rest via the gut brain stuff. But I dont have long covid. I also dont have the actual cognitive symptoms anymore that was only the very beginning after the hangover but not the caffeine. Just blunting/anhedonia/sexual issues

I dont think its OCD because then you could say anybody with sudden anhedonia MDD has OCD,if you know what I mean. Like at a certain level all mental ailments could be called “OCD”. And my obsessions decrease when the symptom improves. Regular OCD also doesn’t present with anhedonia/blunting. 

Like in a sense look at r/anhedonia are they all OCD when its drug-induced? Or other illnesses that cause anhedonia like PSSD PFS and even long covid. Then you would be able to say they are all OCD. The DSM for OCD technically states if the obsession is coming from another mental issue (like anhedonia/MDD) they can’t diagnose OCD.

The problem is anhedonia/blunting affect your life every minute that it is physically impossible to not obsess since pleasure & emotions define life.

Its not like say, low mood (my mood itself is normal btw) or anxiety or even actual OCD alone, where you can use distraction to stop obsessing because in those ailments pleasure and emotions are still intact. So standard OCD treatment also fails here. And stuff like SSRI/SNRI can end up making anhedonia + blunting much worse

Either way maybe the MAOI nardil could work im considering, its supposed to help anxiety and anhedonia both. Im not sure how to break this cycle otherwise and evidently even others who never had actual OCD on r/anhedonia and r/PSSD are also constantly obsessing, so I would wonder at what point can you call MDD as OCD. Theres a ton of people who suffer persistent anhedonia after something like Aswaganda or NAC or Lions Mane too, are they all OCD? 

Because at some level, it seems like every mental illness could be called OCD. MDD in the sense you described, Body dysmorphia or anorexia in that ppl are obsessing over body, PTSD in that people are obsessing over their trauma, etc

And at the same time at some level everything is physiological, even obsessing itself.

"I understand everything you’re saying and I’m not claiming to be right about anything, I just didn’t know if you had explored that path yet. 

I experience anhedonia, I know exactly how it is. It’s such a cruel and crushing ailment and if I knew for sure its roots for my particular case or how to treat it, I wouldn’t be on Reddit searching for answers and learning about others’ experiences. All I can do is spitball and consider all possible information, the same as you’re doing. 

Regardless of the root of any mental illness, it’s a physiological error that could be caused by any number of things. For example, Depression can be caused by a life event, but the physiological effects experienced are rooted in a psychological perception. That’s a common and standard and understood example, but the concept goes far deeper than that. That type of depression is no less real than someone who is genetically depressed. Different roots, same resulting physiological alterations.

Please understand that I’m not telling you that you certainly have OCD or that any of this is all in your head. These types of issues are so fucking hard to get to the bottom of. 

I look for patterns and consider anecdotal evidence from others, scientific research, medicinal avenues, and everything in between to compare it to my own situation and see if I can make any steps forward because the alternative is just laying down and dying. 

Though I know we don’t “feel emotions”, we certainly can still feel pain, confusion, fear and hopelessness over this condition. At least we know we’re still human. 

People do overcome this. I can’t promise that you will or that I will, but it’s a solid fact that there are those who know exactly what we’re talking about that have found something that pushed them through to the other side, even if it’s just time itself.

"Yea, and its something I have wondered about too just from my observation. Its also not well studied the whole anhedonia leading to obsession over itself, and its interesting. Anxiety disorders leading to depression for example is well studied. But the vice versa opposite seems like a pretty unexplored area. 

I never understood how it was possible to experience anhedonia without obsessing over it though. Particularly in the case of sudden blunting/anhedonia. And it is a theme I notice in others with similar sudden issues as well

Nardil seems like it might be the best from the GABA effect to stop both the obsession and anhedonia. Pregabalin for me seems to work at least when I take it.  I just hope the GABA from nardil will outweigh the PEA stim like effect (some people on r/MAOIs told me it does)."	caffeinehell	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9892269372940063	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
"Yeah, it’s a frustrating “chicken or the egg” situation, and there’s so many possible influences that it becomes overwhelming and impossible to accurately nail down exactly what’s going on. 

And you’re right, anhedonia is so jarring and all-encompassing that of course it breeds obsession, which further muddies the concept of possible unearthed OCD and often just makes things worse. 

I don’t even know what a “cure” to this would feel like. Does something snap overnight? Do I find a treatment route that works and it very slowly gets better? Do I accept the anhedonia and do my best to find a way to live a meaningful life despite it?

Conversely, have I convinced myself that this is hopeless and in turn sabotaged any possible chance of remission? Has the anhedonia and my personal version of depression created a negative thought loop, pessimism and a sense of doom that is keeping me stuck psychologically and psychologically?

I think I’m gonna hop on the MAOI train, too. But honestly, I’m already protecting myself and assuming it’s not going to work because I don’t want to deal with false hope.

"Yeah, I’m hoping to get even just a tiny boost from *something* that’s tangible. Just a small pinch of “okay, we’ve got something here” that I can physically replicate so I can reap those benefits *and* convince my brain and subconscious that we are making progress. Then, ideally, it would snowball from there with improved behavioral changes and further exploring tangible solutions until that feeling of “this is pointless because of my anhedonia” no matter what I do turns into “anhedonia is a symptom that I’m learning how to treat, and it’s possible to separate myself from its grips, even if it’s still there”.

Basically, a reverse snowball effect is the goal. I’ll do the work if I know what the work is. I’ll live with anhedonia right now if I know that I’m heading towards relief. 

It took a lot of synergistic negative symptoms and chemical issues to get me this low, so, theoretically, there’s a way to go back the way I came and climb out of this. The frustrating part is figuring out what that means for oneself. It’s hard to formulate a plan when everything seems like a contradiction and the very symptoms that you’re wanting to treat are causing you to be paralyzed. 

I’d love to try Ketamine, but it’s too expensive. As for MAOI’s, I don’t know if I’ll have the motivation and mental energy to find a doctor that will prescribe them, but that’s probably my next goal.

However, after a year it stopped working. The panic attacks, anhedonia, and crying spells returned. my psych upped my dosage to 300mg but it didn't help with my mood at all, but instead all the side affects increased ( nausea, blurry vision).

Luvox (Fluvoxamine) is approved to treat depression in many countries throughout the world, however, it has not been granted approval by the FDA for this particular indication in the US. I think the data suggests it is broadly as effective as other SSRIs for treating depression, so I’m not sure why it has not been approved for this purpose in the US. I’m from the UK, where Fluvoxamine is an approved treatment for depression (in fact, it was the first SSRI to be released to market in my country), but it is rarely used nowadays, as it has largely been superseded by some of the newer antidepressants. Nevertheless, it’s worth a shot if you have tried other treatments that have failed. I personally have never taken Fluvoxamine, but it does have an interesting pharmacological profile, especially with regards to its potent actions as a sigma-1 receptor agonist. Some of the older medications have largely been forgotten, but that’s not to say they should be overlooked in favour of the newer, more popular medications.

Not to mention the transporter binding affinities on this drug are fairly weak: there are many SSRI/SNRIs and DRI/NDRI/NRIs that are more potent which could give a stronger effect when combined than Ansofaxine."	Thomas_Bonk	reply	na	na	na	0.0018713269382715225	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

I'd be very interested to see a real SDRI personally... I know the effects of dopamine and norepinephrine overlap to an extent, but for the particular sexual side that plagued me with these drugs (anorgasmia) dopamine is helpful and noradrenaline isn't. Nevertheless.... would still be interested to give this a go when it finally gets onto the market (and I'm not based in the US so expecting a couple more years beyond the US launch to finally make it here).

Combing it with something like Aripiprazole or Nortriptyline might prove very effective.

Let's hope it's more like pristiq rather than effexor and doesn't need the ""ER"" version. Then again, if it doesn't last too long, might make sleeping easier.

Yeah this will be helpful for some I would imagine. It is going to have some different affects, and those might be just the things for certain groups of people, and others not so much. Always better to have another tool even if it doesn't fix everyone. Being TRD myself I suspect this class won't work for me and really need a different class of drug to fix whatever is wrong. Haven't had the money for ketamine. Maybe that would do the trick. The problems with the tricyclics is their side effects. I am so old that those are what I took in the beginning. Worked well but those side effects were a bitch. Sexual side effects were horrendously bad, but I did take them and they do work, in my opinion, better than SSRI's and SSNRI's.

I wasnt able to get any reaction from highest doses of both Concerta and Effexor. Doctor says there is a %4 chance of effexor not working because your liver does not have a specific enzyme it requires to obsorb venlafaxine. Also studiest say atleast %80 of users have a reaction to Concerta. Odds of beign unlucky back to back is pretty low but not impossible.

But it’s obviously a complex mysterious problem, and it’s not easy to find treatment that’s effective for some people, myself included. So called “treatment resistant depression” is a thing. I’ve tried dozens of meds btw including Effexor, multiple SNRIs, SSRIs, TCA’s, NDRI, multiple stimulants, MAOI, psychedelics, TMS, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, combos between each etc. Some provide very noticeable effects, some are extremely helpful, others are barely noticeable, others seem to only make my problems worse.

Just more likely to feel strong side-effects even at lower doses, feel weird/dysphoric/agitated/lethargic, less tolerant to anxiety and stress, etc.. I used to be on the highest possible doses of some of the most potent SSRIs/SNRIs and not notice much of a difference, could take 200-300mg of modafinil and immediately fall back asleep, etc.. 

Now it’s like I have the opposite problem, which is very frustrating and confusing. No idea how to explain it (maybe things I’ve taken in the past have sensitized my CNS to drugs somehow? Maybe I’ve just become way more anxious which amplifies side-effects? Idk). My case seems to be fairly unique tho, so I wouldn’t worry about going through the same thing.

Have you noticed this med reaction after being prescribed antidepressants, or just since becoming depressed? Could be from underlying anxiety or that these drugs are actually mildly exacerbating your depression (antihistamines can make you tired and have a depressant effect, for example).

Can't be sure. I do remember before my first major depressive episode, I had a really weird feeling after having antihistamine. Very disorientating. After having depression, It was so bad I just had to get on a med. So I don't know if it was my meds or depression. But I had anxiety way before depression but never took medicine for it. Magnesium worked great but now does not do much for depression. I did notice I lost my high caffeine tolerance a few years before my depression started. Now a little bit of caffeine gets me agitated or paranoid, sometimes can make me feel stressed or make my breath shallow and I might get heart palpitations with a bit more.

"Small and consistent changes over time is what does it. I say this a lot but I am a huge fan of adjusting your morning routine as it sets the tone for the rest of your day. One of the biggest things, at least for me was NOT LOOKING AT MY PHONE (social media) for the first 45 minutes to an hour - spend that time journaling, writing down 3 tasks you want to complete for the day, even if its something mundane like brushing your teeth and folding some blankets, or just spending 20 to 30 minutes tidying up a room, you could put walking for 30 minutes on there also. 

As far as groceries or cooking goes - that's a little trickier but I would suggest you automate and simplify it as best as you can. So, create a master list of groceries you consistently get , and then plug them into the online shopping app for your local grocery store - you can then do online order and pick up which relieves the stress of having to go to the store, you just get to take a nice drive and have someone else do your shopping for you. Find recipes for easy to do meals , if you have an Instant Pot and/or an air fryer you can make almost anything really quickly. 

Again, some of that can be your small to do tasks across multiple days - one day you could just have the task of creating the online account for the online ordering, next day could be make the master list , next day could be do the online order, etc. 

Just some suggestions , hope they help. Best of luck to you!"	doucettejean	reply	na	na	na	0.9994388222694397	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

So I did, what a big mistake that was. It killed all and I mean ALL emotions that i had, nuked my sex drive and made me feel wired as fuck like I was legit drugged up (my pupils were dialated to tge max) My psych said i had nothing to complain about becouse the dose he gave me was like 0.7 gram of cocaine (his words). So like any sane person I decided to quit and I choose to do so abruptly becouse I wanted it out of my system asap. I was on effexor for 4 months in total and the hellish withdrawals lasted 2 weeks (the really really bad parts at least).

Caffeine is a hit or miss because of the integrated stress response. If D2 becomes too inhibitory it starts working in the opposite direction (reducing goal directed behavior) and same thing happens if metabolism is compromised (namely CYP1A2 expression).

Cannabis withdrawal for whatever reason causes a strong increase in goal directed behavior for me. However, this doesn't happen if I don't use high amounts for at least 3 days and it lasts barely 2 days, strongest on the first day so it's not very useful because acutely it causes the opposite effect.

"[Inhibiting the integrated stress response inverts the action of D2 receptors on dopamine release.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8457366/)  


The stronger your integrated stress response is, the more sensitive you are to D2 activation. This is relevant to Caffeine especially since it works by activating D2 receptors both by antagonizing the adenosine 2A receptors and increasing D2 expression.

"There’s not too much information online or on Reddit about this topic, but I was wondering if you guys have tried it, heard of it and had positive or negative experiences or knowledge of this topic. 

Supposedly we all have a gut-brain axis so our gut health is directly tied to our brain, neurological and mental health. We also tend to have tons of bacteria, worms, parasites, fungal and other infections in our guts that get deeply embedded unless cleansed out. 

The question I have since there’s a dearth of information on this topic is if there is something significant to this or if it’s not really going to make much a big deal. Does flushing out most of these infections and harmful organisms from our gut have the potential to cure mental, neurological and other chronic illnesses. Is it these organisms that cause and/or worse these illnesses or are they mostly insignificant in regards to those problems and the treatment of which would have no major long term impact?"

I would of course like to find a med combo that can help me, but I don’t have a psych atm and my GP isn’t the best.

I feel I need to get out of my head, be somehow grounded, I’m not sure what. I just need to do something that’s not scrolling or reading Reddit for hope that there’s some medication that might help.

I actually quit my job a week ago. Which has worsened my situation. I had it for three months but it was super stressful, they couldn’t get me enough hours and it was low paying. But it was probably a mistake to quit and I agree about the benefit of a job. The problem in my country is that state supplied unemployment insurance, which I was on before, is quite high and if you have a part time (low paying) job you basically get nothing out of it because they subtract the payout from the insurance. It’s a very demotivating system, but people vote for it so I guess most ppl like it.

Its also why people should check their levels in the morning via blood test or better would be like the DUTCH test which looks at the HPA axis  through the day and the cortisol awakening response (CAR). Before assuming anything. PTSD is often associated with a blunted CAR.

"...have you tried mood stabilizers like Depakote and Lithium?

I have a suspicion that many here who says that failed on all medications or label themselves as treatment-resistant depression could have a bipolar (depression) diagnosis.

I speak for myself. After many failed attempts at a bunch of SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs and a few antipsychotics, I'm doing well on 1000mg of Depakote at night.

"I'm so sorry, dude (I call all genders 'dude'). Truly. And it's one of the main fears I had with ECT when I was suicidal and considering it 1.5 years ago. My memory/creativity/skillset is one of my strongest features too, and even though I could stand to lose a few (especially traumatic ones), I know the matter isn't so simple; and nothing I read nor heard from experts on ECT was sufficiently reassuring, even in my supremely desperate state. Thankfully some redditors (maybe you were among them?) adamantly warned against ECT. 

Treatment tech done via ""IDK how it works"" really needs a harsher warning label on it. People like us can't afford to have our functioning get worse. A capsulotomy or cingulotomy are better options honestly.

I opted for a different ""severe"" treatment path - definitely had its own risks - even if just the delay in recovery and stuck in toxic environment. But the author of book I read about VNS talked about experiencing a similar situation after ECT when he went back to work: relearning *everything.*

"I’ve had lots of ups and downs over the past decade+ when it comes to meds. I’m pretty treatment resistant and for many years I relied on stimulants while getting through uni and the beginning stages of my career because I failed on all the first- and second-line antidepressants.

I’m currently 9 months pregnant with my first child so this is the longest I’ve been off medication but I was actually doing really well before getting pregnant on Stablon (tianeptine). (I’d also take low dose methylphenidate during the week) It’s not prescribed in most countries but you can get it from online pharmacies because it’s not regulated in many places such as the US, I think Canada and UK as well but I’m not sure. So it’s not illegal, just not on the market. 

Before stablon, the only thing I responded to was low dose buprenorphine and it literally changed my life. I was a whole new person and didn’t have any nasty side effects. But it’s very hard to get it prescribed for depression. I switched to stablon because it also works on the opioid system to a very small degree. But for whatever reason, that seems to be what helps me personally. Stablon is also a serotonin reuptake enhancer rather than a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, so it works in the opposite way of many standard SSRIs and the like. I always did very poorly on meds that increased the availability of serotonin so I think that also plays a role in why stablon works for me. It’s a shame it’s not regulated in more countries but I’ve been happy to buy mine via online pharmacies. 

It does get a bad reputation in the US because it can technically be abused in enormous quantities. For intense, the standard dose is 12.5mg 3x daily of tianeptine sodium. But people take thousands of milligrams of tianeptine sulfate powder to achieve what I hear it a very shitty and very short opiate-like high. You’d really have to go out of your way in order to abuse the sodium pills… and I can’t imagine it’d be much fun. 

Sorry, long answer! Also, not sure if it’s the same with Depakote, but when my hair started shedding with Parnate, I was able to take another medication with it that stopped my hair from shedding. It wasn’t working for me though so I stopped the medication in general but it could be the case that there’s something to counteract Depakote’s hair side effects. I know losing hair as a man is big deal. My husband has stopped an antidepressant for that very reason. I get it. Also if you haven’t tried MAOIs (Parnate, Nardil, especially but also Marplan and Emsam) I have a lot of faith in them despite them not being right for me personally.

"If anyone wants to use clomipramine and bupropion together, it’s probably best to also take CBD or an anticonvulsant (could be gapabebtin, could be carbamazepine). Using two drugs that reduce the seizure-threshold argues for a bit of caution.

I guess I’m kind of fond of the combination of clomipramine and topiramate because topiramate helps with weight-loss (and there can be quite a lot of it in the case of this particular medication) and is an anticonvulsant. But these are conversations that ultimately need to be had with and screened with individual doctors. Topiramate has its own weird side-effects but at this point in the game it’s just about what you’re willing to tolerate in that regard vs. how well the medication performs in terms of actual efficacy. One thing that even I’m openly willing to try topiramate for is the fact that it apparently reduces sweating but I might just take propranolol again (which is supposed to act fairly similarly in that regard). As an extreme hyperhidrosisiac there’s little I won’t try to get rid of it/substantially reduce it at this point.

That’s each individual’s call to make (and, by the way, some of the side-effects of it can be treated directly) but the trade-off is often worth it, yeah.

"Fluvoxamine’s a little niche out of the SSRIs for some reason (inferior marketing, I suppose) but that doesn’t mean it’s not a good medication. It’s thought of as somewhat more of an anti-OCD/social anxiety medication than an antidepressant per-se (it’s also good for ASD in adults, amongst other things) but it serves many purposes. It’s like where fluoxetine (its older cousin), escitalopram, salbutamol, mirtazapine, clomipramine and risperidone/clozapine meet and try and fuse into one drug. It’s not weird, odd or particularly ‘unconventional’ once you get to know it. People who specialise in things like OCD and in the last three years Covid-19 love fluvoxamine but it’s not a drug that’s particularly commonly prescribed by your average GP/internist.

It’s a sigma-1/σ1R agonist (unlike certain SSRIs but not unlike fluoxetine) and what that does is reduce the emotional blunting that comes with other SSRIs and produces anti-inflammatory effects in the body that lower the risk and severity of certain types of cancer (including colon) and lung problems. It has quite a lot of drug-drug interactions which make it more difficult to utilise (and propranolol always has to be replaced with atenolol when someone’s on fluvoxamine and in need of a beta-blocker) but beyond that there’s really no reason to think of it as an odd, awkward drug to be honest. Like with trazodone, it wouldn’t be my first solution-answer to depression per-se but that doesn’t mean it isn’t effective for that particular condition. It’s just better-known for helping people more with other stuff.
All-in-all it’s a very invaluable drug but one that’s also very underrated. 

Fluvoxamine, btws, enhances the serotonin effects of clomipramine and clomipramine enhances the effects of fluvoxamine so one has to be careful about taking both drugs together, so while the question of both medications has come up I thought I’d just get that out there."

"It’s a known mechanism with melancholic depression have a read here I’m sure you will find it interesting. 

Melancholic depressive patients report that they feel worst in the morning, just after waking up, get better as the day goes on, and feel least affected in the evening just before bed. Continue the trend, and you might wonder how depressed people would feel after spending 24 or 36 or 48 hours awake. Some scientists made them stay awake to check, and the answer is: they feel great! About 70% of cases of treatment-resistant depression go away completely if the patient stays awake long enough. This would be a great depression cure, except that the depression comes back as soon as they go to sleep.

"For the last 3 months by the recommendation of my doctor I started adding Effexor to Wellbutrin xl (150mg) which I have been on for 2 months prior. I started at 75 then 150 in the first month then 255mg for the next two. when I added Effexor to Wellbutrin I became more sleepy, lower energy, completely unmotivated (almost bedridden) compared to my usual (which is pretty bad to begin with) 

&#x200B;

I thought it would go away with time but it didn't so when I completed my 3 months ""trail"" on Effexor about 3 weeks ago I started lowering my dose from 225 to 150 to 75 and by yesterday I began 37.5 and I plan to stop completely within 2 weeks (thankfully I didn't experience most of the horrible withdrawal symptoms that I read about online before starting but I start having vertigo and pressure around my eyes when I lowered my dose to 75 and I still have them but I hope they go away with time)

"Hi all, I would really appreciate any advice on coming out of this burnout/complete lack of motivation. Warning: this is a long post. If this isn't the right subreddit, please let me know!

----

I graduated college in May. For the first three years of college—and for my entire time in high school—I couldn't conceive of getting a lower grade than a B+ each semester. I struggled a lot (and still do) to motivate myself to complete tasks without procrastinating for hours, which combined with my focus on grades so that I spent all my time doing homework (or trying to get myself to do it). If I did end up doing badly on a test or assignment, I would feel horrible about disappointing myself and doubled down on studying. Honestly, I didn't really mind this way of life as I genuinely enjoyed school.

I was prescribed 37.5mg of venlafaxine by my primary care doctor about 2.5 years ago during my sophomore year of college, primarily for social anxiety. It definitely blunted my anxiety but it didn't seem to help my depression much. Then at the beginning of my junior year, I increased the dosage to 75mg. This reduced my anxiety greatly, but it also seemed to make my depression worse. Despite this, I was still able to stay on top of my responsibilities throughout junior year. I was going to school full-time and working part-time, and because I had transferred after freshman year, I basically had to overload my schedule to finish a 4-year degree in 3 years. The summer between junior and senior year, I also worked full time at an internship while continuing with my part-time job.

**I'm not sure why exactly this happened, but after starting senior year I started to see no point to most things because I felt like they would all lead me to the same place: a boring job after graduation.** Maybe it was partially due to seeing the ""real world"" in my internship? Anyway, as a result, I didn't feel bad when I got bad grades and saw no real point to getting good grades. **After coming back from Thanksgiving break in November, I started to feel like I was literally physically incapable of doing anything that required mental effort.**

I basically stayed up until 4am every day, slept, lay in bed for the rest of the day, and only left my room when I needed to go to a class with mandatory attendance. This continued for the rest of that semester, winter break, and for the spring semester. It was probably the worst during the spring. I skipped almost every class and was on the verge of failing a few of them, but I simply couldn't get myself to care even though one professor kept reaching out to me. Thankfully, at the end of the semester, I somehow realized that there would be very real consequences if I didn't change things, and I stayed up for like 3 days completing the assignments I didn't turn in (still so thankful my professors accepted them).

I'm living with my parents now and trying to find a full-time job while working part time, but things are still pretty much the same. I go to bed way too late, wake up way too late, and can't motivate myself to do anything as minor as taking a shower, washing my face, brushing my teeth, or doing laundry. **I really wish I could have my ""past self"" back but I don't know where to start. I don't even know what to call whatever is happening to me.** If it's burnout, shouldn't it have gone away by now? 

Also, I'm wondering if this might be related: I started doing (unprescribed) Adderall in my sophomore year. The first time I took it, I felt like it truly changed my life, and I was able to keep my use to once a week. I started using it a bit more in junior year and then every day during my internship because the work was too boring for me to do without the assistance of drugs (and I had to wake up at 5am, which didn't help). Interestingly, it seemed to basically stop having an effect around November, but I continued to use it every day or almost every day until I graduated (I literally would sleep for the whole day without it). I can't find any good sources where I live now, so I'm only using it a few times a week at the moment. I never took *that* much of it, with my highest doses being 40mg/day. I also started taking kratom and vaping in the fall of my senior year (I've quit vaping for nicotine gum since)."	confusedthrowaway144	post	18.190606214141184	male	White	0.9932873845100403	na	na	na	3	depressionregimens
It may be the case that your life wants you to reassess your decisions or direction. It’s a good idea to get acquainted with your struggles in life and your parents struggles to understand why you lack so much motivation. I never reached your level of being unmotivated that much but I wasn’t that much better off honestly so I can relate. I think becoming an adult is to say the least hard. How do you make money? Do t jobs just suck your life? What about relationships? It’s hard sad complicated and expensive. I don’t have the answers but anytime you eat properly fresh foods consistently you’re giving your body the resources it needs to heal and ideally move in a better direction. Improve your diet if you can and that’s a good start.	confusedthrowaway144	reply	na	na	na	0.9932873845100403	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens
"Thank you!! I definitely agree, I also feel like this is a sign to reassess my direction. Improving my diet is a good start, I definitely don't eat healthily enough... I should probably start exercising too.

I've been thinking more about it lately and have finally realized that I can't just wait to live until I identify my ""purpose;"" for now, I need to pick a direction and go in it by finding a job that fits my degree (because that's just what everyone has to do if they want to survive). This will probably give me a better idea of what I want and what I don't, and I can find a different job later. 

It still seems so depressing that in order to satisfy their basic needs & simply stay alive, most people spend decades doing work they don't really care about or that they actively hate. I wouldn't mind spending all that time working if I felt like I was doing something meaningful, but I'm not sure what that is yet."	confusedthrowaway144	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9932873845100403	weak	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
You’re welcome! That last paragraph is pretty much the book Walden by Henry David Thoreau. I agree 100% with you it’s some of the most soul crushing and depressing aspects to life. His way of looking at it is you gotta study how not to have to work so much and live as much as possible. That may involve long periods of working but then long periods of chasing your own pursuits without working. You can either work a decent amount save up and live or alternatively work part time 3 8 hour days or so then reclaim the other 4. The modern world is designed to suck you dry to the last drop. We do that to the environment and to people. There are only 3 riddles you have to solve in life with money to gain freedom: living space, food and transport. By reducing or simplifying those three you purchase your freedom for the future.	confusedthrowaway144	reply	na	na	na	0.9932873845100403	weak	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"I've tried several medications and based on which ones have worked, I think my depression is dopamine-related. I also have anxiety, but all the medications seemed to help that enough. My history:

* **Lexapro** alone was ok but I had no energy and was napping all the time.
* **Lexapro + Wellbutrin** I felt amazing but the Wellbutrin gave me tinnitus so I had to stop.
* **Cymbalta** did nothing and gave me horrible withdrawal symptoms so I think I'd like to avoid SNRI's.
* **Trintellix 20mg** alone was partially helpful but I had no motivation, low energy, and was sometimes quite irritable.
* **Trintellix 20mg + Rexulti 0.25mg** is what I was on for the last two years, and I generally felt great minus some emotional blunting, but Rexulti made me constantly crave junk food and want to drink and use weed, and I gained a good amount of weight.

I stopped Rexulti two weeks ago (because my doc left the practice so I couldn't get a refill in time), and I've noticed all the cravings go away, so I'd ideally like to change up my meds to something that will better support my physical health in that sense. Since Wellbutrin and Rexulti have been the only things to work, I think my depression is more dopamine-related. My main depressive symptoms are low energy, brain fog, lack of motivation, and anhedonia.

Any suggestions on what to try next? I was thinking Prozac since that's supposed to be energizing, but I feel like I'll also have to supplement with something else since serotonin-based medications have never been enough for me."	ohpacific	post	38.71762296346303	male	White	0.9956941604614258	na	na	na	30	depressionregimens
"Get an adhd diagnosis done lol, how do you even know it’s dopamine related? 

For dopamine there’s lots of things: 
- Selegiline for raising dopamine by maoi b; 
- Pramipexole or abilify for direct dopamine receptor agonism, has lots of weird side effects;
- Amisulpride for blocking d2 d3 autoreceptors can raise dopamine for some but I don’t notice any benefits from it only more prolactin;
- prolactin inhibitors like cabergoline;
- tyrsoine, levodopa or mucuna pruriens for giving more materials to build dopamine. 
- nootropics like bromantane which upregulates tyrosinehydroxylase so you actually built more dopamine or 9-me-bc which helps you built more dopamine receptors

- hardcore stimulants like adderall or ritalin, I prefer dexamphetamine and focalin, vyvanse is also more smooth and less side effects. Could ruin your dopamine imbalance even more in the long run. 

I fucked too much with hardcore adhd medication and have debilitating depression & addiction issues still 2 years later.

"i was told by my dad who was addicted to stimulants that his doctor explained it like "" yourbrain is like a sponge full of dopamine and every time you take a stimulant like that it wrings a fair amount of dopamine out of your brain after a while of use your brain wont produce nearly as much dopamine. its like wringing the  sponge dry. you can squeeze it harder yes but thats just going to reduce the levels even more and when those drugs are abused there is the potential side effect that your dopamine levels will never get back to normal. like you r brain only produces so much dopamine for a life time and it gets depleted on stimulantsd"	ohpacific	reply	na	na	na	0.9956941604614258	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"I know it is a bit off topic but. If looking for some other info. 

Some doctors sometimes will try low dose of ADHD meds either alone or in addition to an SSRI.
Meds like Strattera or Ritalin.
Not sure your situation but could be good to at least try it.
Heck ""adderall"" aka amphetamine/dextroamphetamine was used as an antidepressant for year in the 1900s until about 1970s.

Some people have depression that doesn't respond to most SSRIs.

Also could he depression with another mental health issue.
Or
In some cases could be another issue all together.
For example ADHD or ADD can cause a host of issues like anxiety or depression.

Lastly you can ask to try low dose levothyroxine for hypothyroid. 
I had depression like symptoms and the only thing that helped me was thyroid replacement. 
I was technically normal for my thyroid (TSH 2.3), But I was DESPERATE.

"Due to my dissatisfaction in terms of the way the DSM has changed over the years, I’ve built up my own kind classification system for depression. I’m not a medical practitioner and this is just a mere autistic attempt at understanding the mental condition. From what I can observe there are 5 types of depression with hallmarks or distinguishing features and differential responses to medication.

Unifying features: Persistent Negative Mood, Fatigue, Cognitive Disruption, Social Isolation, Circadian Disturbance

1. **Melancholic Depression**  
 	Hallmarks: Anhedonia, Flat Affect, Emotional emptiness  
 	Targets: Monoamine Reuptake Inhibition  
 	Drugs: Milnacipran, Bupropion, second line: Desipramine  
 2. **Atypical Depression**  
 	Hallmarks: Extreme Negative Affect, Positive Event Induced Improvement or Remission  
 	Targets: Monoamine Release and Metabolism Inhibition  
 	Drugs: Armodafinil, Selegiline, Mesembrine, Harmine, second line: Tranylcypromine  
 3. **Anxious Depression**  
 	Hallmarks: Crippling Anxiety, Hypervigilance, Irritability, Extreme Pessimism, Low Self Esteem  
 	Targets: 5HT1A activation, 5HT2C inactivation  
 	Drugs: Agomelatine, Cannabidiol, second line: Fluoxetine, Buspirone  
 4. **Treatment Resistant Depression**  
 	Hallmarks: Persistent Default Mode Network, No Response to Common Antidepressants  
 	Targets: MOR agonism, NMDA antagonism, 5HT2A agonism  
 	Drugs: Tianeptine, Harmine, Memantine, Mesembrine, second line: Ketamine, psychedelics  
 5. **Bipolar Depression**  
 	Hallmarks: Depression with Risk of Mania  
 	Targets: GSK3B inhibition, DAT/NET/SERT and VMAT pharmacochaperoning  
 	Drugs: Tianeptine, Selegiline, Phenylbutyrate, Bupropion, second line: Gabapentin  
 

\- Bupropion has risk of mania in bipolar depression, should only be used during the depressive phase. - Many substances listed are serotonergics and those should not be combined unless previously determined to be safe (SS risk is largely overestimated in the media).  
\- There are many universal treatments or interventions mostly related to lifestyle medicine, like mindfulness, exercise, cold exposure, diet, socialization, environment and activity enrichment and decluttering, etc.., this deserves it's own post.  


\- There’s also the Seasonal Affective Disorder which can be classified as melancholic or sometimes anxious depression that tends to repeat cyclically throughout the year.   
\- All other types of depression could be considered a combination of the five described types or any single type with missing features and treatment can be chosen accordingly.   
\- More often than not, one type is dominant and always present, albeit sometimes in remission, and the other types are transient.   
\- Catatonia was previously considered a specific form of depression, but this model is now largely rejected and is instead it’s own condition, comorbid with other mental conditions, among all – depression."	roleunplayed	post	32.28255908565013	male	White	0.9778028726577759	na	na	na	25	depressionregimens

for me im unsure which one i have most of the time im apathetic. emotionally blkunt, i dont enjoy things i used to and lose interest in things very easily. i dont feel sad like i need to cry but almost desperately hopeless. i should mention that ialso have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. i have been on between 4-6 if not more anti depressants in both the ssri and snri category and they seem to help for a week or two maybe three if im lucky before i start feeling more apathetic and no motivation and all that. i noticed that was an issue after every time ive had my sertraline increased ive felt more numb and no motivation.  im unsure really what to do. when i was on trazadone for sleep it made a tiny bit of a difference but i was drowsy too much throughout the day on it and it never got better. mirtazapine i was on onc ebut i cant remember if it ever made a difference. i know the last time i took it it made me psychotic for whatever reason so thats out of the questionb. im hoping to be approved for spravato but i doubt i will be due to my MI and past history of drug abuse. it wouldent be an issue if my damn doctor would have left me on the gabapentin that i was on when i moved down yhere as a mood stabilizer. she took me off it cause its a controlled substance and she says that there have been no studies and information to show its effectiveness as a mood stabilizer. im kinda running out of options. i wonder if maybe coming off the sertraline might help im at 100mg and im unsure if my doctor will tell me i need to wean off it or not. she has never suggested i do it before but i dont want to have withdrawal symptoms on top- of not wanting to do anything but lay in bed for 85 percent of the day and sleep or watch tv. thats litterally all i want to do cause they take no effort or energy to do. also my doctor wont give me any cns stimulant stronger than welbutrin to help me. shes a reasl stickler and would rather follow some misguided set of rules than help the patient. but switching doctors also has risaks that i cannot afford right now. anyu suggestions on meds to try or what to do if i dont get approved for the spravato?	roleunplayed	reply	na	na	na	0.9778028726577759	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

Ive even turned to nootropics sometimes. Bromantane helps me occasionally which is weird as its a “stim” but its kind of different in that it barely increases NE.

Milnaciprine is a SNRI with primarily the NE uptake inhibition so from what you told me not very suitable.
Mesembrine is a serotonin release agent and it might help acutely but don't overdose it trying to catch the high because you'll fail and acquire a long lasting tolerance,  also if you redose it constantly you'll get the same sides you got from SSRIs.

">for this reason Spravato was created

Not entirely true. Spravato was largely created because J & J realized the greater potential for ketamine as an antidepressant and wanted their ""cut"". Ketamine obviously was available for years and is quite affordable. The patented drug is demonstrably less effective than its racemic counterpart, even if it is able to be dosed more frequently (it also essentially *has* to be for most people). Intranasal compounded ketamine is safe in the right hands. Sucks people abuse it it or don't respect its potency/side effects, and that the DEA/CDC just are way behind on everything drug related.

Ketamine in general is best utilized in cases of suicidality, TRD (especially with chronic pain features), and then immediately paired with behavioral modification to take advantage of the temporarily increased neuroplasticity and reduction of dopamine in the ""disappointment center"" of the brain, ideally in an improved environment - or at least one that isn't directly worsening said symptoms e.g. abusive family/job you loathe/unhealthy daily habits.

>Milnaciprine is a SNRI with primarily the NE uptake inhibition 

Also not entirely true. You might be thinking of levomilnacipran (Fetzima) - which has a markedly greater action on norepinephrine (I think actually of any SNRI). Milnacipran (Savella), is arguably the most serotonin/norepinephrine-balanced RI out there - even if it may indeed increase norepinephrine too much for some people. As per usual with ADs, YMMV.

Good info otherwise.

I'm curious what your issue is with the DSM-V? I honestly barely skimmed it because I find the DSM in general very wanting and not particularly fruitful for me in terms of treatments.

"I think since tyrosine or mucuna l dopa is a precursor and not a releaser or reuptake inhibitor it ends up slightly helping because the body controls how much goes to DA and NE so it avoids doing the latter. On the other hand, DLPA was bad for me I suspect because of the PEA increase stimulant blunting which acts like a releaser. 

Thats very interesting that Bromantane is GABAergic too. I did not know this but it explains a lot. 

Im considering potentially Nardil but given my bad response to Parnate 5 mg 2 days worsening my symptoms from probably the PEA stim effect idk. Nardil also goes to PEA but has GABA which may balance it

It seems like the best solution for me may be Zuranolone. I have tried alloP drops and they were amazing the first day and same with Etifoxine. But it didnt happen again or was subtle at best. 

With ketamine I meant that it made me feel worse, so it was bad. However TAK653 sometimes (its very random) brings back some emotions and its an AMPA PAM, which is strange bc my response to ket was bad. Its stimulating but doesn’t act at NE and so my reaction to it is good at a low dose if it works but often does nothing.

About Milnacipran you're right, my bad... it's slightly more selective for SERT... Tho' compared to all other SNRIs... I don't think it means much.  
Sorta unrelated but you may find this amusing... I know a person that combined Levomilnacipran with Dextromethylphenidate to a 1:1:1 transporter inhibition ratio to ""replicate cocaine with a longer half life"", or in other words, cure depression and ADHD.

About DSM I don't like much of it but in terms of depression they just made a single disease out of it as if we're all the same which makes 0 sense as there's clearly different types of depression and they respond differently to meds. So now it's just a simple straightforward process, check a few symptoms on the list and tadaa you're depressed go take your Escitalopram at the pharmacy. That's great and all... if only the brain was so simple. To be honest I feel like even what I did today doesn't do it justice, there's probably many more forms which could be easily overlooked and misdiagnosed but as I already said I'm not a medical practitioner and don't have experience with patients so don't know the true extent of the neurodiversity...

"Maybe your alpha 2 adrenergic receptor is downregulated. This would cause norepinephrine release disinhibition. If you also have low DBH expression you would end up with a sensitivity to reuptake inhibitors but no problem with precursors which is exactly your case. If you have a high amount of methylating substances like SAMe flowing around your body it would also make you sensitive to PEA as it's metabolized to active methylated phenetylamines which are resistant to MAO metabolism.  


I wouldn't go with Phenelzine if I was you, sounds like a waste of time.  


I think the lowest hanging fruit for you is high volume, low effort endurance exercise which increases KCC2 expression and thus the expression of all GABA receptors, greatly increasing inhibitory power of the brain.

I definitively shopped around for a looong time though. Like since my shit became TRD/physical problems piled up landfill-high, I starting pushing for maximum treatment options. 

My NP at the time wasn't too hyped about ketamine (which is fair considering the IRL results) - this was arguably around the time when ketamine was more widely available, but very rarely covered by insurance. Or she wasn't comfortable/smart enough to try compounding pharmacies. Or maybe they hadn't yet found reliable cost-effective ways to dose it. Idk. The oral troches I sometimes use are reasonably affordable.

>cocaine clone

Interesting. Yeah I know on some level medications just start to become ""drugs"" 😂. Like 'my brain just is default miserable and needs drugs' - kinda situation maybe? Then again, his lil experiment kinda reveals why antidepressants are indeed different from straight hard drugs.

Yeah sometimes when you just shotgun blast the brain with the big monoamines-based molecules you aren't necessarily better off - maybe slightly more mechanically ""functional"". 

But yeah I think some p-docs aren't totally in denial about TRD/D2TD and are willing to ""add a lil heat"" to their treatment regimens i.e. whatever works, works.

I think you're not off to a bad start. Clearly certain treatments work way better for certain people with depression. Like the brain isn't totally figured out by AI yet, so yeah until they just offer/force us to be like the Borg, I think more stringent and situation based classifications are in order.

As shitty as it is to say, you can get some idea of how one's depression works/manifests/is somewhat treatable by how they respond to certain recreational chemicals.

"Real psychedelics no, as ketamine doesnt count. That explanation makes sense and im not sure what psych drugs will fix this. 

Ive done a round of MIF-1 also a peptide which is a dopamine PAM and has some effects on opiod that i dont get fully. But it does help a lot while on it after a few days. Problem is benefits dont last. It also upregulates tyrosine hydroxylase like bromantane.   

So pure dopamine helps. What may help alpha 2 receptors? I also have tried guanfacine and while it calms me down it doesnt help the blunting/anhedonia. It does not worsen me though (well if i take it daily i get loss of motivation and motivation is not normally an issue for me, the blunting/anhedonia is) 

Yea of course exercise is good for everything but its difficult and takes a lot of consistent effort and time to help which isnt grewt when acutely suffering. Perhaps I can combine that with the noots that help a bit though.

Otherwise you think Zuranolone can relieve my issues? I think it can, as I tried Etifoxine and AlloP drops and for a day my symptoms greatly decreased, but they developed tolerance and now only are subtle

">Biggest regret of my life.

Would you mind elaborating if you're not uncomfortable with that?

I've had a friend who's done a sleep study so I already knew that those existed but for some reason just the name alone sounded intimidating and next-level-ish??? So I never once considered to look into them for myself, but thanks to these comments I guess they might be worth it? I will say that I kind of suspected it might be delayed circadian rhythm since that can be comorbid with ADHD, so I've pretty much just gone ""*guess my circadian rhythm is messed up/different, oh well*"" and never really thought to look into it further."	yoricake	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9977192282676697	no	strong	strong	na	depressionregimens

"Yeah I don't mind, sorry it's long. 

Basically I had a bad depressive episode just before the pandemic. My fam and I thought to try medication since I've had chronic depression for 10years and the oversleeping/tiredness wasn't improving. So we looked for a psychiatrist and because my medical history had ""chronic depression"" on it, he didn't check for any other potential causes. Straight onto antidepressants and trial/error to find what works. 

While that's a normal process to go through, the psychiatrist wasn't interested in diagnosing and ruling out physical causes. After trying 10(?) different meds, over 2years he got up to 100mg of Lamictal, 300mg of Effexor and 70mg of Vyvanse. And I was feeling the worst I've ever felt. I was numb, tired, couldn't leave my apartment or even do chores. Just work my abusive job (hello actual cause) and sleep. I was a zombie.

Then around Aug 2022 the uncontrollable/unconscious - sleep started. Ive never had this happen before. I slept at least 14hrs per day every day for a month. Two of those days went for 24hrs. And it's not the sleep where you feel awake but don't want to get up. It was blacked-out-from-general anesthesia sleep.

So I requested a sleep study. He didn't give me a referral. I insisted on my next monthly appointment and organised my sleep study. The experience with the sleep Dr was amazing. Before I even talked to him, the staff tested my lung capacity, checked for obstructions in my airways, etc. The sleep Dr, after looking at the initial test results, suggested a one night monitoring study from home. After that was done, he explained the results, which was that my sleep is fine and I don't need treatment from that angle. Great news for me being physically healthy. Doesn't explain my newfound uncontrollable sleep.

A friend recommended I talk to a pharmacist. They did a review of my medications and it turned out that the combo of meds I was being prescribed at high doses (the Effexor and Vyvanse were at the highest legally available) does interact badly for some people. I just happened to be one of those people.

Up until this moment in time, everyone's actions are understandable. We're figuring it out, there'll be mistakes and such. What's not understandable/acceptable is what happened after this point.

The psychiatrist was on holiday when I realised I needed to get off the meds. No substitute available and due to legal restrictions, no one else had the authority to prescribe a lower dose. When I finally got in touch, the psychiatrist didn't want me to taper off the medications. He was insisting I continue taking them but also that ""if I wanted to"" I could just stop (I.e. cold turkey) taking Vyvanse. My mother insisted for tapering so he reluctantly gave one lower dose. Later on, he was unreachable when my prescription ran out. So I had to go through mad withdrawal without medical support from Dec 2022 to Feb 2023.

I luckily found a different psychiatrist who was willing to help me taper off the rest safely. I'm off Vyvanse as of Jan 2022 and Effexor since last week. Hoping to get off Lamictal by the end of the year. And apart from the dizziness and nausea that withdrawal causes, I'm waaaaay better - physically and emotionally.

So yeah my regret is blindly trusting drs that give treatments without testing and identifying causes first. I've essentially lost 2.5 years to being on meds that make me sicker and experiencing crippling withdrawal getting off of them. Bonus points for learning that Vyvanse is primarily used for treating ADHD/binge eating disorders and Lamictal is primarily for bipolar/epilepsy. I don't think I have any of those conditions but I also wasn't tested for them anyway.

I'm hoping to be back to my healthier pre-medication state sometime next year. I'll consider asking for proper testing/diagnoses and appropriate med options after that."	yoricake	reply	na	na	na	0.9977192282676697	weak	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"first, most people doesn't know what is rbd, it is an atypical form of depression -or bipolar- where a person experiences a -almost- 3 day depressive episode every month or so -ranges i found where from 17 days to 2 months-, in the episode one experiences a usually severe depression with hypersomnia and frequent breakdowns, sadly, a lot of doctors doesn't think it is a real thing as it is quite rare
background: 10 years of undiagnosed ocd, -probably- 2 and half years of depression
pre-rbd time: 2 month long depressive episode taking  fluvoxamine and paroxetine, nothing working and it got worse really fast  
rbd: out of nothing depression got resolved for 3 days, then i had depression again for the next three days, and all my days for following the cycle of 3 good days followed by 3 bad days, i took clomipramine, risperidon and fluvoxamine for a month with no benefit, changed the doctor, this one prescribed venlafaxine, which got me good for a week, but then depression hit back at its scheduled day, so even tho it worked it didn't change the cycle timing, he also prescribed olanzapine which didn't do anything by it self -until now-after not getting any better -in reality worse as symptoms got worse with every cycle-, he prescribed lamotrigine which stopped the depression, but only for a couple of days
here comes the really weird parts which i have no explanation for: lamotrigine flipped the cycle at first, so the 3 bad days felt good -a notice that i had totally no will power at the pseudo good days-, then the 3 good days felt bad, the next 3 days felt good but with the same notice, then it stopped working, at that time i stopped taking olanzapine for a couple of days then retook it so i had a strong hypersomnia side effect, then the cycle flipped but with out the notice and it shifted time so slightly that now the cycle starts around 10 oclock,  and the cycle takes exactly 72 hours, which is really weird, i checked this not once, but four times, even when i had really big hope that it would end which should nullify any placebo-kind mechanism, i went to the doctor, he increased olanzapine dosage which finally stopped the depression with no return, -i guess it the reason- it got me into hypersomnia but at least it is more manageable and i hope it ends in a short time.  
notice: i think -from the treatment course and from everything i read about it, which is almost everything written about it-it has more to do with bipolar than depression

After having MDD for 4 years now, I've decided to try medication (Wellbutrin XL 150 mg). It's been two weeks since I started the med, and I feel like there's generally way less negativity, no more suicidal thoughts and im in general happier. So far I'm really pleased with the medication. The first 1,5 weeks I was always out with my family to buy new things to design our house, but now I really have nothing left to do. Before I took the meds I was crying daily and just laying in bed, and although I don't feel like doing that anymore it's still hard to get into the habits i used to do when i didn't have depression (meditation, journaling, programming, sports, etc). I thought about starting journaling my thoughts again but that's really it. Any testimonies on what you guys did after getting medicated for the first time? Thanks in advance.

I feel the same!!!! Absolutely. I don’t enjoy anything and I’m anxious all the time and down. I had three ketamine infusions and then the shortage caused me to not have one in months. That being said it did help for a time especially with the anxiety and look forward till when I can get it again. My Drs office is going to start administering through the nose after they go through the training. The only thing that has helped is knowing that suffering for a long time is ok.

It’s gonna suck for a while. See if you can steer this situation into a healing direction. I know you’ve tried many things, very little motivation, bleak outlook. My first instinct to get out of a similar situation was to understand the world I’m living in. Why is it this way? What am I running away from? Where do these problems come from? I wrote a lot as honestly as I could for months and stopped periodically to reflect. I had no shortage of complaints about my life and how despite well meaning efforts to improve I always ended up back in a corner. Slowly time passed but it passed and I fixed my living space, my diet, my relationship to myself and read my about people I admired. I still think about the past to process it from time to time but I feel much much stronger than I’ve ever been. You can heal but it’s gonna take time.

"Sorry man. You’re not alone.

Although you’ve tried a lot, remember that you definitely have not tried *everything*.

There’s so many different combinations of depression therapy out there; combinations are quite literally endless.

By this, I mean not only are there new drugs/lifestyle changes/therapeutic approaches that you haven’t tried, there are possible *combinations* of these things that may even include things you’ve already tried. 

Random example, a sibling of mine tried a ton of drugs to no avail, but ended up going back to one of the first ones they ever tried again. They altered the dose, added a supplemental medication, tweaked their sleep schedule and diet a bit, and it did the trick. I’m still blown away at the transformation, and their personal seemingly impossible to find cure was actually pretty standard. It just took them a lot of trial and error to get there, which is extremely common. I don’t know of any clinically depressed person that found significant relief in their first attempt at treatment. 

Medication dosage, combinations, diet, lifestyle and just where you are in life all affect each other. 

Like I said, there’s an absolutely endless amount of combinations (I promise I’ll stop using that word lol) when it comes to treatment approach, which is both hopeful and frustrating.

So many people that post online about their successful treatments usually include something along the lines of “I tried for 30 years and had given up hope” or “I can’t believe something actually worked for me”.

It happens. It really does. I can’t guarantee that you’ll find your magic effective balance of treatments, but why not stick around and see what happens? You literally have nothing to lose. 

In the meantime, separate yourself from your mental illness and try to work on a deep self love and forgiveness in the background while you wait on figuring out what’s going to help your physical brain."	Evening_Attention_45	reply	na	na	na	0.9991911053657532	strong	no	no	na	depressionregimens

bs advice reall imo. some people dont know why they feel the way they do. like me, i can look at my life objectively and see i have no real reason to be as depressed as i am nd i cant blame anyone for it in the past cause we hurt ourselves by how we respond to verbal abuse and the like. still have no idea why im as depressed as i am. no real higher purpose in a world like this one. starting something new may rrequire more effort than what it is worth especially if you dont know if there is going to be any reward for doing it. the psychobabble therapist stuff dont work for some of us simply because of brain defections or chemical imbalances and we need some more concrete treatment aso opposed to talk therapy or cbt therapy. that suff may help with some people but with the mental illness i have and the obsessive thinking patterns it causes those talk therapy things arent likely to change anything or they may even make them worse by making you wonder why it isnt working for you when you are doing what they are telling you to	Evening_Attention_45	reply	na	na	na	0.9991911053657532	weak	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

This sounds a lot like me as far as my current underlying depression goes. My earlier depressions were probably related to other things. You may need something more than meds… like talking therapy. Also, physical exercise is a potent antidepressant, especially if you do it consistently and long term. Try to change your perspective. That helped me a bit. Getting older doesn’t necessarily mean having to live a shittier life, just living a little different life. Also, I believe love can be found at any age, but it might not be the type of love or type of relationship you envisioned when you were younger.

"My in-laws are extremely resistant to the modern explanation of what depression is and the effects it has on people.  For example:  when she found out I was depressed in the first place, my mother in-law said that I should just be able to ""take a pill"" for a ""couple of months"" and then suddenly be cured.  I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, and have known that I was depressed since I was 7 or so.

More recently, she accused me of ""seeing myself as a victim"" and that I should just ""get over"" things that happened to me in my childhood, as though those things didn't shape the foundations of who I am and how my brain works.  And, yes, I have been seeking therapy and I already have a psychiatrist.

Their latest hang-up is with my dismal sleep abilities.  I have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, and waking up at a normal time, making me essentially permanently tired.  Last Thanksgiving she and my father in-law cornered me and *argued* with me that I'm not actually tired, I just need to sleep less now that I'm ""older.""  About a month ago, my father in-law sent my partner an article titled ""10 Things You Can Do Instead of Rotting in Bed All Day.""  It was definitely intended for me.

Does anyone know of any literature or scientific articles written by a medical professional but accessible in language for a layperson to understand?  My repeated and patient explanations of what is going on with me seem to be making them increasingly more and more angry with me.

"I recently was a victim of a psychiatrist taking me off Cymbalta cold turkey. He almost sent me to the psychiatric hospital because of how bad I got within the next 3 weeks after stopping. He does not believe in Antidepressant Withdrawal Syndrome (ADS) and refused to believe the abrupt discontinuation of Cymbalta was a potential cause. I was almost going to go to the hospital because I thought I was going crazy for no reason but I found this article online from the Cleveland Clinic. It had almost every symptom I was experiencing. I followed the instructions in the article and started back on my previous dose of Cymbalta and within a few days I was stable. Anyone on antidepressants should read this and be aware, and if your doctor doesn’t want to believe in ADS then print this off, show it to them in your appointment, and find a new doctor if you can.

I would 100% support any sustainable euphoriant as an antidepressant but dopaminergic stimulant tolerance rapidly results in loss of mood effects after a few weeks of stable dosing for most people. Amphetamines do remain very effective for executive dysfunction even with tolerance, and these benefits have been demonstrated in open-label extensions of randomized trials lasting several years.

Extremely unlikely, beyond perhaps experiencing some rebound in terms of reduced focus, motivation, and executive function if you skip a day after dosing daily for a long time.

"Depression and work, advice/input?

Ive been struggling with depression since my masters degree, so about 2015. I work/study in healthcare. I always had difficulty keeping a job longer then 1-2 years because of either my anxiety or depression. When I work up to a full workload, I always get overwhelmed. This sort of makes me wonder if I have some form of undiagnosed ADHD as well? What do you think?

In 2021, I decided to give up jobs dealing with patients as I felt I wasn’t able to give my all in patient care. Since then ive been going from job to job, mostly administrative stuff(case management). But I still find myself struggling mentally and cognitively. Whenever training is fully done, and Im working towards having the full workload, I always end up overwhelmed. This feels humiliating. I have a masters degree in healthcare and cannot understand why Im struggling so much to keep a job.

diagnosed with MDD, GAD, ADHD. I have had no changes using Effexor and concerta at their highest dose, Only side effect is sexual dysfunction. I can tell effexor helped with irritation a little bit but that's it. My doctor is one of the most expensive psychiatrist in the country and he really is a well informed one. He was shocked to hear that i had no changes with concerta even no side effects, he kept thinking in silence for a bit he couldn't find an obvious reason other than  liver enzymes are too fast perhaps. He asked for a TDM (blood drug screening) and he will decide wether to increase effexor to 300 plus or change to Wellbutrin. He said that we have no alternatives to concerta in my country, he might add ritalin twice a day to it with maybe modafinil, Thats alot of dopamine inducing drugs. He seemed hopeless talking to me, he also handshakes and smiles after our session but this time he didn't smile. If Wellbutrin doesn't work than we are left with no options this worries me alot.

Research into why you can sometimes feel worse is thought to be the brain needs to regulate the brain chemicals. SrRI stops the reuptake of serotonin, so sometimes the brain mistakenly overcompensates by lower production so as not to overload your brain.

Theres really no logical explanation imo why this was rejected. Really I think its because its too effective, sadly. Other bigger companies (those who make shitty SSRIs for example) may have pressured FDA into scrutinizing this more and not approving it 

It really doesnt make sense how meds with so many potential nightmare side effects get approved but not this. Lets say something was only slightly effective or effective for a subset but had lower sides, that logically should still get approved but it doesn’t as seen here

Instead make patients try horrible SSRI/SNRI/etc and suffer because well it makes more $$. Curing someone via neurosteroids loses out on all of this.

"Lots of weird stuff posted here. I am familiar with the FDA approval process and somewhat familiar with Zuranolone. It does not sound like the drug is dead  for MDD but may require further clinical trials to demonstrate effectiveness.

Some of the comments here seem to suggest that people think this is going to be a drug for major depression beyond PPD, and the government is holding it back for pharma or some other nonsense. Clearly you are not familiar with this drug. This is a short acting drug. It works for about 30 days then stops based on the research. I believe it is fairly fast acting too. This is good for PPD as it comes on pretty quickly and severly, this drug could alleviate it long enough until either the patient doesn't need it or can be put on a drug like an SSRI that takes 4-8 weeks to kick in. So you give them this new drug for 30 days, meanwhile the SSRI is starting to kick in. 

I was surprised they applied for MDD for this drug given its short action of about a month.  Sure a month of relief would be better than nothing, but this really isn't what I have in mind for a treatment, something that at least works for a long time. This is not that drug. Also as I understand it this drug is for women. I am not sure if men can take it as it will, if I remember, raise the levels of female hormones in the body. Also the mode of action of this drug is not new, it is the same  brexanolone. The new thing here is this is a pill rather than IV so the patient doesn't need to stay in the hospital to get it. This drug is not the next big MDD treatment, it is short acting then stops, it is for women, and there is another drug already on the market doing the same basic thing except it needs to be injected.

"That phase 3 MOUNTAIN trial though had issues--people were not compliant. When you analyze the compliant subset it beat placebo by quite a bit. This does look like some rigging going on to me. I'm not very optimistic about Ansofaxine, yes its an SNDRI but its metabolite is desvenlafaxine which already exists. Its essentially almost 'just another SNRI'.

This Zuranolone was actually something that could be very novel--its a neurosteroid and these are extremely powerful. Allopregnanolone potently even reduces inflammation. We have known about hormones and MDD for decades and the theory all checks out, even in the trials the data seemed fine but then this happens. I believe the 14 days is more that it can 'reset' the GABA system in that time period. Same as Brexanolone but this is a 48 hour continuous infusion. 

Plus, you have so many studies saying SSRIs are no better than placebo. And other studies even admit SSRIs don't treat anhedonia (considered one of the most debilitating symptoms), for example, well. But somehow this one study where non-compliance affected the result changes everything for Zuranolone? Like what's up with this?

There is all this focus on the clinical trials, but nobody mentions the goal of them is just to get the medication approved.  Anybody familiar with the meds knows that a trial of 4-6 weeks can't return accurate results as for some people they don't even start working in that time.  Nobody mentions we have much better date.  Real life experiences for 30 years.  The next thing said is that it is all profit driven.  Right now almost everything is generic.  If SSRI's were so bad doctors would have shifted to prescribing different classes of antidepressants which they haven't.  Look at trazodone, it is too sedating and has fallen out of favor of doctors prescribing it for depression.  Although they found in real-life that it is so sedating that it helps people with sleep which it is primarily prescribed for now.

Still though, so as not to build tolerance to the anti-anxiety effects, gabapentin is not something that I would necessarily recommend taking everyday the way you take lexapro or an SSRI everyday. Furthermore, it can be combined with an SSRI, so it’s not an either/or. 

If you feel like lexapro isn’t adequately treating your anxiety, it may be worth bringing up gabapentin with your doc.

"EDIT: due to some concerning comments from men on this thread, I’d appreciate AFAB or AFAB allies comments only. Sorry I don’t want to discriminate but I don’t like to be given women’s psychiatry advice from unsympathetic male perspectives, because that’s the issue I’m dealing with my male psychiatrist. Thank you. 

The last two weeks I’ve entered another major depressive episode. Last one I had was last summer so about a year ago. I had a hormonal IUD and I feel like that was contributing to it so I took it out. I am currently on Lamictal, Wellbutrin, and up until two days ago, the Xulane birth control patch. I had been on the birth control patch for two months prior to stopping it. 

I’m starting to question my doctor. He made me go off my birth control, but I think it was actually helping my mood cause I have PMDD and I was using it to skip my period. I had just gone off Cymbalta three weeks prior when I started having the depression episode, and I think he is not acknowledging that at all, and is blaming it on my birth control. He wanted me to basically stop 20 mg of Cymbalta, cold turkey, but I actually did a slow taper myself because I read online that that was a very bad idea. I was still having brain zaps three weeks after I stop the Cymbalta and he said that was incredibly unusual, it’s not.  He also said that most people can just stop SSRIs cold turkey, which is absolutely not true. 

I want to go back on my birth control, but he says I can’t until I get mentally stable, but he’s not acknowledging that I am more than likely going through withdrawal from Cymbalta and having rebound depression from that. Again I believe the birth control was helping my mental stability, and now I am incredibly anxious because my state is close to banning abortion. Then he told me afterwards that when I mentally stable, I can go on a progesterone only birth control, which, if you read studies is not recommended for women with depression. Then I told him I’m getting my tubes tied soon because I do not want children ever and he started to question that decision.

Not sure what to do because I feel like it’s my right as a woman to go on birth control during these crazy times in the United States, and he thinks that his drugs arent causing a problem. He said just get another hormonal IUD, I said absolutely not because made my depression worse last time, does not control PMDD, because it does not stop ovulation, and I’m never given pain management for the insertion. He said “well you can just get it done under laughing gas” and I asked him to find me a gynecologist that would do that which none of them actually do that. 

He wants me to go on Depakote next, but I have never been diagnosed as bipolar, and I do not want to deal with a drug that causes weight gain, hair loss, and tremors. I feel like I need another anti-depressant because Wellbutrin is not working. I really want to try nefazodone, but I doubt he would go for that.

Also, he suggested I go to the psych ward for five or six days and pull me off all my medications to start from a “blank slate “ I told him fuck no because I have a job and I cannot just be doing that casually.

I feel like every psychiatrist I go to is absolutely stupid and if anyone has any recommendations on what to do in this situation, I would greatly appreciate it. You would think that someone who went to Cornell for their medical degree would know better.

Edit: I will not get a copper IUD. I can’t handle insertion pain, it causes heavy and painful bleeding, and does not stop ovulation to control PMDD. I like my birth control patch."	0010011010110100111	post	34.329566550279765	female	White	0.99293053150177	na	na	na	103	depressionregimens

"I just switched from my psychiatrist to a psych NP. Jury is still out on whether my med management will be better, but at least I felt like my psych NP listens to what I have to say. Not saying all psychiatrists don’t listen, but mine sure stopped listening when the first 3 med changes didn’t work. And she never wanted to think outside of the box.

As someone who prescribes birth control (I’m a nurse midwife) it drives me nuts when other providers tell someone to stop their birth control for their mood when the patient doesn’t think it’s the birth control messing with their mood. It happens all the time. It seems everyone wants to blame it on the birth control. Of course if the patient says “ever since I got the Nexplanon placed, I’ve gone off the deep end” that is another story. Why are there so few providers in the world that actually listen to the patients experience of their own body?

Oh, and, you know what really can fuck with someone’s depression? An unplanned pregnancy.

Birth control can be challenging. My AFAB partner had to hunt around to find the right one, and even ones that the doctor said were ""nearly equivalent"" gave her massive migraines.

"Ideally i’d say get a different psychiatrist who understands the critical importance of bodily autonomy, but i know that’s extremely hard right now. Get back on your birth control and tell him firmly that your decisions on your birth control are not changing, it’s not his lane to change your birth control, he needs to work with your decisions on that, not the other way around. You know your own history and your own body’s responses. He should be supportive of the tube tying decision considering the alternative is hormonal birth control which as you both already know can be mood-altering. (Note that it is THE alternative. It is your right and your choice to ensure that you do not have kids. His demand that you go off of birth control is not a valid alternative. It’s not his place to say anything about any of that, he isn’t your primary doctor or obgyn, it’s not his place to question.)

He doesn’t seem to understand withdrawal at all, bet he’s never tried discontinuing an SSRI/SNRI in his life, and bet he’s never truly listened or followed up with his patients who quit those drugs cold turkey. They absolutely have withdrawals for weeks or months and the brain zaps are debilitating, plus the fact that withdrawal from an antidepressant OBVIOUSLY MAKES YOU MORE PRONE TO DEPRESSION AND LESS STABLE. Making you change the hormonal birth control on top of all of that is pouring salt on the wound and creating a new instability, he’s a fucking idiot for saying “wait till you’re more stable, oh also we’re gonna make another mood altering change right now”.

Going off your meds in the psych ward is also an absolutely terrible idea, what that hell???? That just sounds like it would be traumatizing???? Withdrawal from multiple drugs plus new providers plus being exposed to a lot of people in crisis plus heightened anxiety about work plus starting new drugs is NOT a blank slate…

Stay on the birth control and be firm about it. This would reduce the confounding variables, and make it more clear that the cymbalta withdrawal is the reason for depression/instability right now. Him trying to change your birth control is adding another confounding variable… it takes 4-8 weeks minimum for antidepressants to start working in the first place, so why would it not take just as long (minimum) to withdraw from them?"	0010011010110100111	reply	na	na	na	0.99293053150177	weak	no	no	na	depressionregimens

"Well, I’ll be the 100th person to agree that he is not a good psychiatrist, and it’s better if you find someone else.

As for birth control, depending on the individual it could cause depression, but it definitely also helps some individuals with PMDD. Only your experiences can tell you what works for you. If you absolutely want to try a trial without hormonal birth control, I’d suggest using the copper IUD (no hormones). But in general, you need a receptive and knowledgeable doctor to guide these decisions for you, and this one doesn’t seem to be it.

"You’re like the female version of me! I relate to you so much! I’ve gone through countless therapists and psychiatrists, have tried over 30 mental health medications (plus around 10-15 meds for an array of physical illnesses i’ve had like GERD, nausea, acute-chronic stomach pain, etc.). 

My current regimen is 8.6/2.1mg Zubsolv for MAT (i’m over a year sober), 35mg Dexedrine Spansules for ADHD, 50mg Lyrica upon waking and 150mg Lyrica qHS for anxiety and insomnia respectively, as well as IV/IM (i switch it up occasionally, mostly IV) Ketamine for C-PTSD, TRD, TR-GAD, Social Phobia, PD, & OUD/SUD. In my opinion and experience, based off what you’ve said i’d definitely try and get another psychiatrist. 

If there aren’t any interactions between your current psych meds and the BC you’d like to go on, i’d suggest you go to your family doc and have them prescribe the BC until you find another psychiatrist. Also, I especially relate to your cymbalta withdrawal experience heavily. 

Back in summer of 2020 I got baker acted because i had a bad reaction to the Xanax i was prescribed and was also in the middle of a stimulant binge. At that time I was prescribed 600-900mg Gabapentin TID, 60mg Cymbalta qD, 5-10mg Lexapro qD, 25mg Seroquel qD, 250mcg Xanax qD PRN, and Medical Marijuana. 

The brain zaps were absolutely terrible. They ended up misdiagnosing me with bipolar 1 disorder while i was there and slammed me on a regimen of divalproex sodium, starting me at 250mg Depakote DR BID and titrating me up to 250mg Depakote DR TID. My experience with depakote was overall negative, but i also remember some positives. 

The first day out of the mental hospital i remember having to go to the hospital for some reason relating to the depakote. I think it was nausea/vomiting, stomach pain, etc. I ended up getting switched to 1g Depakote ER and 300mg Seroquel ER (which was then changed from ER to IR for the Seroquel). The Depakote made me less anxious but it wasn’t worth it with all the side effects. I developed a bad hand tremor over time and couldn’t get out of the bed in the morning i was so sedated.

"1. Absolutely no SSRI/SNRI should be stopped cold turkey at any dose without some level of taper. That can induce Antidepressant Withdrawal Syndrome. Go on this subreddit and look up experiences of people trying to get off even the smallest doses of Cymbalta. 

2. Laughing gas is not general anesthesia and is commonly used in dental surgeries, so there is no reason it cannot be used in an IUD procedure. Google the difference. Also, you must not own a cervix and know the pain of having something rammed through it. 

3. Lamictal, while yes is a bipolar medication, works differently than Depakote. Lamictal is the only mood stabilizer that calms mood swings by lifting the depression rather than suppressing the mania. Therefore Lamictal is commonly used  off-label as an adjunct to treat unipolar depression. Depakote is used more to suppress mania. Lamictal also carries a very little side effect profile, while Depakote has a lot of side effects.

Not to mention condoms and spermicide are not nearly as effective as other birth control methods, even if you do use them perfectly, which most people do not. 

And the suggestion that you should use a progestin only form of birth control because it will impact your mood less is strange.

"Question- is this guy this thorough about anything else in your life you take, good or bad? (drinking, perhaps? Or smoking? Headache Pills? I dunno, acne meds? Your exercise schedule? Your weight, as docs love to get involved in? Anything?)  


Some bc has mood effects, sure. And a good doc (which I don't believe this guy is, FWIW) would evaluate all their patients other source of incoming chemicals, meds and hormones.   


But I have a set of red flags flying at how much time is being focused on your reproductive choices, by a (older?) male doctor in an authority position, in a state 'close to banning abortion access', in a problem that kinda isn't related to reproduction.  


I mean, this conversation you talk about here? The Depakote is a stupid recommendation start to finish, yeah. But pretend for a moment it wasn't, that this was a GREAT suggestion for a new angle for you to try, right? But there's scary side effects? Here's the convo I picture:  


Doc: Try this it's better  
You: But Doc, it has side effects that scare me!  
Doc:  Yes, Susan, it does, and I understand how they can be scary.  However, side effect a and b are very rare occurrences \*insert stats\*.  And side effect c is more common, but we will do \*insert management strategy\* to help reduce it. And here's why I believe it's best for you \*insert facts\*  


Why is his answer to 'Drug X scares me' to talk about....a completely different class of drugs that aren't in his speciality at random? Was there some extenuating circumstances here? I can't imagine what they would be, actually, but just something that explains why the answer to talk about so-called 'new right drug X' was to talk about.... reproductive choices?  


And EVEN if we give this allowance of any sort- the tube tying? This is only relevant to the 'having an opinion' stage for a non-gynecological doctor for 2 reasons. 1, that you would be stopping a medication you take.... but he's already pulled you off that, right? And b) it may cause a hormone imbalance. So again:  


You: Doc, in a few month's I'd like to get my tubes tied, anyway.  
Doc: Ah, ok. It may be wise for us to do some hormone panels for \*inset time\* after that, to make sure fluctuating hormones don't affect your depression treatment. I'll make a note of that. Let's talk about your Psyche Sh!t (tm) now.  


A gynae MAY have reason to actually ARGUE with you about reproductive choices, but even then it's your choice in the end even if they think its a worse course. A psych doc? Much, much less likely to have real ground to stand on actually trying to disagree with that.   


Why is this man so up in your lady parts? I can understand the PMDD having some relevance to a depression conversation, but he seems like he's dismissing that too, so this isn't a more holistic doc being sure to treat all angles. He just seems really keen to spend half your psyche session time talking about how you shouldn't use bc....in a state 'close to banning abortion access'.  


I wasn't there, but this kinda screams 'doc with opinions about birth control thinks he has a captive audience he can bully now he knows he's got local government on his side', honestly.   


Unless you missed one hella lot of context, a non-gynae/reproductive doctor this fixated on reproductive management choices and seemingly ONLY reproductive management choices is someone with issues who is not doing their job. I'd almost go as far as to say he thinks you are the 'hysterical little woman who needs a real life and a baby to calm her down, then she'd forget this depression nonsense.'

"Yeah I feel you, I had (have?) PMDD too and I'd be scared of going back to that state. I know birth control works differently on everyone but for me it definitely contributed TO my mental stability and not against it, I would be irked if my psychiatrist said I have to wait UNTIL I'm mentally stable to get on birth control. That and his comments about ""just get laughing gas lol"" makes me think he really doesn't take PMDD (or women's hormonal problems) seriously at all.

Listen, I know some people would be like ""You're depressed, don't make decisions for yourself"" but that's only because depressed people often make decisions based on their feelings, and not based on their long-term goals/consequences/well-being (my favorite saying for depressed people: ""The feelings come and go, the consequences last""). But you're only thinking of what's best for YOU. Don't think that you can't make decisions for yourself.  
Again this might not be good advice lol but, in the end, your psychiatrist doesn't have anything at stake, he doesn't NEED you to feel better. You're the person that need yourself to improve.

I didn't have the 37.5 pills and you can't split the beads inside the capsules in half because it's XR. Effexor withdrawal is even worse than cymbalta withdrawal.

"Yeah, this is not a provider for your issues (psych) who is delivering on those issues (managing mental health issues in tandem with Other Life Sh!t and medications you may take.)

Your relationship is only relevant in so far as 'is it going well or is it a mental health strain'? And that goes for ALL significant relationships, not just who you choose to take the train to pound town with- parents, kids, other significant figures, work, and so on. Your bf shouldn't be the only spotlight UNLESS you've identified him as a problem factor and your other major relationships as not.

Doctors can and do develop G0d complexes. They get irritated by the 'Doctor Google' crowd. They are human, not machines. But the more vulnerable their target populace, the more careful they have to be. And mental health patients? Are very, very vulnerable. You can and do get people who enjoy that bit of a power trip. They shouldn't be given that scope.  


My ex was an ER doc, so again a very vulnerable population, and while he had his issues, he was diligent in trying to make sure that he was issuing medically relevant advice (even when it was life advice as well), not just assuming he knew better because the other person had less power then him in their medical relationship.

Good doctors do their best to stay in their lane while still delivering quality care. Sometimes you do need to hear their opinion to get better- but nobody outside of a relationship therapist you hire to address issues or your reproductive medical team need to be exclusively focused on offering opinions on s3x-reproduction factors. And certainly not to the detriment of patient well-being and their progress in their area of care.

"Look, in all honesty...less then a century ago, we were still drowning, electrocuting, and brain-stabbing people in the name of mental health. It is still in its infancy as a science or a medical field. So... there is no cookie cutter solution for everyone. Some providers are cutting edge up to date. Others deliver tried and true solutions well. And plenty do neither.

And you know something? Opening up about our mental health is one of the most vulnerable things you can do. I think many people would feel less vulnerable stripping naked in the doc's office then letting them into their head.  By all means, you have the right to be a bit demanding.

You need the right help and support for you.

And sadly, the very best mental health docs are still stuck using the equivalent of a spork and a piece of yarn to fix the Titanic, so young is our understanding of exactly what powers us and why it goes wonky in so many different ways.

30, f. Been depressed my whole life, with other issues like CPTSD and suspected autism. I need some hope that something will help me. I’ve done everything right - worked on building a life for myself, tried being healthy and proactive in my physical and mental health. I’ve tried different psychotherapies, over 30 medications, TMS, Spravato, IV Ketamine. What else is there? I became so exhausted and just gave up. Threw away my career, relationship, and home. Moved to a new state and have spent the last two years falling into alcoholism. I’m a week sober and trying to be healthy again, so maybe things are particularly trying right now. But I truly don’t see a way out. I grew exhausted trying so hard to get better only to still want to kill myself every day. I don’t see the point in trying again only to be let down. Is there anything out there I haven’t tried that can maybe help? I’m barely hanging on.	samsaysmeow	post	36.93728450234333	female	White	0.9982209801673889	na	na	na	22	depressionregimens
"Fortunately and unfortunately, there’s a lot that can contribute to TRMDD. Alcoholism specifically can deplete or “sub clinically” lower thiamin, which can make you feel worse. 

If you tried 30 mediations, did any of them stand out in a positive way? They might not been what you needed then, but may help now.

Withdrawal (acute and post acute/chronic) from GABA agonists (alchohol is one) can make you feel a lot worse in the short term due to GABA down regulation as well as effects from the toxicity of alcohol. 

Also, your diet might not have been great during the period of alcohol use which can cause its own set of problems.

Things I’ve learned over the years to make sure are in optimal ranges to feel much better and beat TRMDD: 

Vitamin D level. 
Vitamin C intake
Vitamin A intake
B12, 6, 9, and 1 intake. 

Iron intake (even with normal HbG low ferritin caused a lot of problems for me. You need enough iron not just to make blood but also dopamine, and potentially for your thyroid to function properly) too much iron is also problematic and should have blood tests done, as well as examine your diet. I had blood work done and re evaluated my diet, and started 25-50mg/day iron supplements depending on if I had eaten meat that day. I was previously vegetarian, it caused a lot of problems for my health. None of this is medical advice and your actions are your own responsibility. For anyone reading this be careful, though from what I’ve read for the vast majority of people 50mg/day of iron is the upper limit and won’t cause problems for the vast majority of people. However this is total iron, not just from a supplement, so YMMV. 

Same story with zinc and copper. Having enough of both of them and enough iron changed my life. But you need to be careful with these. 30mg/day high bioavailability zinc and 2mg/day high BA Cu were huge for me, combined with iron literally life changing.

Had probably 50 doc visits and no one mentioned anything about any of these, just “eat healthy and exercise”. When pressed about what that entails you get 10 different answers of whole food etc. with no regard to actually meeting your need for these specific micronutrients.

The neurochemical pathways for vitamin D and A via gene expression affect dopamine receptor expression and tyrosine hydroxylase (to make dopamine) and dopamine receptor expression respectively between D and A. 

Vitamin C is more complicated but it affects neurotransmitter levels too. 

Then there’s the whole immune/inflammation pathway of depression which also gets almost zero attention when it’s one of potentially very important. There are more strategies for dealing with that but the above few all affect it and can be anti inflammatory especially if you weren’t getting enough in the first place."	samsaysmeow	reply	na	na	na	0.9982209801673889	no	no	strong	na	depressionregimens

Is it the same psychiatrist prescribing your meds? If so, try seeing someone different. I also have TRD and have tried dozens of treatments. MAOI (Emsam) was the first one that helped me the most, although it wasn’t great, just better than the others. Psych recently started me on Abilify in addition to the Emsam.

"Have you tried ADHD medications? They're used off-label for TRD. 

Stimulants tend to work as they're dopaminergic and dopamine makes people feel good. The downsides of stimulants are they can exacerbate anxiety, cause insomnia, increase blood pressure, and cause significant weight loss. 

Methylphenidate extended release is usually the first option for TRD. Lisdexamphetamine is the other option. Dextroamphetamine is often used as a booster for lisdexamphetamine. The milder stimulants like modafinil seem to work, too. A non-stimulant ADHD medication called atomoxetine can also be helpful for TRD. It is a potent NRI.

The antipsychotics are rather useful for TRD. Abilify and Seroquel XR are the two I would recommend. The rest have pretty shitty side effects, but I found those two to be well tolerated even at the 15mg and 400mg doses respectively. 

A horse dose (450-600mg) of venlafaxine XR is another option. The side effects will be shitty and you'll probably need to have it initiated in an inpatient context, but this is what a lot of psychiatrists prescribe for TRD. Mirtazapine is often added for theorised synergistic effects."	samsaysmeow	reply	na	na	na	0.9982209801673889	no	no	strong	na	depressionregimens
"Psilocybin (also sometimes LSD or MDMA) has been of interest clinically in treatment of PTSD and I've heard a lot of success stories but I don't know many specifics.

What has oddly worked the most for me more than any particular medicine is logotherapy and philosophy - building a different worldview and an understanding and model for how to contextualize and process or move past trauma. Especially of note are Camus' Myth of Sisyphus and Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning. 

There are some good books on complex trauma too.

Once you have accepted death, you are truly free. Life is much more about ""why not"" than it is about ""why"" - you are only here for a little while. Procrastinate on dying until later, and do what you want. Figuring out what that is can be very difficult, but is important.

Have you found a therapist with experience with autism? Things like establishing a strong routine and systemizing your decision making to relieve cognitive burden can be very important for healthy functioning in people with autism, even mild. Have your therapists helped uncover and process the sources of your trauma and your relationship with it? 

Of course it is also important not to get too sucked into introspection and rumination. I'm quite guilty of this - thinking unproductively about things as a means of coping, instead of living in the present moment and just doing things."	samsaysmeow	reply	na	na	na	0.9982209801673889	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

First of all, congrats on your week of sobriety.  If you stick with it, you’ll find that stopping drinking can do wonders for your depression.  Two, have you ever tried Parnate or Nardil (MAOIs).  They work when many other drugs have failed.  Prescribers are loath to prescribe them because of overblown concerns about hypertensive crises that arise from eating foods rich in tyramine.  In fact, if you dont go overboard on eating tyramine rich foods (yes, you can still eat them) and avoid contraindicated drugs (I.e., drugs that raise serotonin levels), they’re extremely safe.  And they’re the most effective antidepressants out there.	samsaysmeow	reply	na	na	na	0.9982209801673889	weak	no	strong	na	depressionregimens

\+++++++++++

That being sad, I will give you my data.  
Lowest was 11ng. Testreport said: you have a deficit of 600.000 units.  
So I took 20.000 units for a month, to ramp up.

I need 17.000 units daily to KEEP the level.  
With 14.000 units my level sinks.  
With 20.000 units my level raises.  
That mainenance level of 17.000 units scared my family doctor as well as my endocrinologist, but my blood level are fine. These data are monitored since three years, 15 tests done. Online test (as described below) match with ""official blood sample"" from my doctor. This is my demand, acc to my experience.  
DO NOT COPY!

While ramping up I make test each four weeks to check, where I am.  
On level I make tests each 12 weeks, to make sure, everything stays fine.

Due to your situation you might have a completele different daily demand.

You started with 17, and now you are on 35(??), which is higher, but still pretty low. This would meet with ""did not notice a change"".  
Probably you are now on 25ng and you need 20.000???   
Lets stop guessing, make a test!

My goal is 90ng, that is the top corner of good supplementation.  
91-150 is oversupplementation  
151+ is poisoning.

I recommend tests from [cerascreen.com](https://cerascreen.com). 25€ german price. Easy to do at home, delivers a very good, detailed report. Buy a double pack, you need another test in four weeks.

Please also keep in mind, VIt-D needs fat to be absorbably. So get drops with oil or eat a bit of fat with the pills.  
THESIS:  
I did \_not\_ have depression and cured it with VitD.  
I had massive lack of VitD and that CAUSED the depression.

Ok, serious question, serious answer:  
Human beings live and have ever lived in communities.  
Think back 500years. Living lonely in the forest was a serious danger to survice.  
Living together in even a smallest kind of a ""village"" increased your chances to survive.  
Living together was necessary to reproduce, raise children etc.  
So we all want to be loved, wanted, accepted, KEPT in the village.  
To be expelled from the village was a severe punishment in older times.

This ""fear of being expelled"" and ""wish to be accepted"" is deep in our genetics.  
So you think, ""was my behaviour ok for my village?""  
I am not a doctor, psychatrist, therapist, but this behaviour seems ok in general.

try this checklist:

I take rexulti 2mg from the beginning of 2021 (and I will probably take it forever), I take it as an antipsychotic and antidepressant, nowadays I take 2mg which has stimulant, pro-cognitive effects, increased libido and a little antipsychotic too, I even went to 3mg to further increase its antipsychotic effect, but the other benefits diminished.

At the beginning of this year, my psychiatrist and I put buspirone, which I had already taken in the year of the pandemic for anxiety, and it worked super well, but now the intention would be to maximize the benefits that rexulti2mg causes me.


I think I probably found the drugs I needed for my treatment in a few years of testing, these two are the ones that gave me the most results without causing me intolerable side effects. And so far it's working, I'm doing very well, ten of which I'm on 40mg of buspirone together with rexulti I'm having promising effects, which only develop and intensify as the weeks go by.

"My medications right now: pregabalin 50mg 3 times a day, about to start Effexor (but really afraid of this one - I've seen so many posts about how if you're late by a couple hours in taking it you can have withdrawal symptoms), quetiapine at night. Ativan as needed. My diagnosis are MDD, anxiety, panic disorder, and PTSD.

When I wake up in the morning (way too early, after about 5 hrs of sleep usually) basically feeling like I'm in the middle of an exorcism. I shake, cry, have strong suicidal urges, have to scream. Pregabalin helps a little bit, but doesn't take away my feelings of shame and anxiety. The only thing that makes me functional is Ativan, but I've been taking it since March and my psychiatrist and I are both trying not to make it a daily habit. If I don't take Ativan, it takes me all day - usually until 4 or 5 - to feel less anxious/jittery/panicked. 

I want to get into a habit of exercising everyday, but honestly, I can barely get out of bed. I still try to go outside as much as possible, walk, do hobbies (though this feels like torture sometimes), get some sun when I can, see people, connect with my friends and family abroad. I'm in talk therapy, I am also trying bodywork, and am on a waitlist for group therapy for PTSD. I don't eat super clean but do try to eat whole foods and eat regularly as well. 

I want to hear your suggestions of what I can try to ease my mornings. Is there a magic supplement/something I can eat at night? Another medication I should ask about? I start a new part-time job next week and also will start living with roommates again in a few weeks, and I'm really afraid. :( "	Successful-Cry-5835	post	29.379539429218244	female	White	0.9907146692276001	na	na	na	13	depressionregimens
"I also have terrible morning anxiety.   I read that our bodies put out more Cortisol and adrenaline in the mornings.  Most depressed people have the same pattern that we have with morning anxiety and feel fairly relaxed/normal in the evenings.  I hate the long hot summer days.  I like the early dark evenings of winter.  It seems that the early darkness allows me to rest.  Anyways, the first thing I do when I wake up is take propanolol 10mg.  This is a beta blocker usually used for blood pressure but it is excellent at assisting your body to relax.  My psychiatrist prescribed it.  I also take Klonopin 0.5mg about 1 hour later.  Then another propanolol 10mg about2-3 hours later.  Then finally Klonopin 0.5mg again around noon.  This regimen has helped my morning anxiety quite a good bit.  I do get tired from these meds I think.  But depression makes you tired so I am not sure which is affecting me the most.  I feel for you as morning anxiety is unbearable.   Another non benzodiazepine drug you can take for anxiety is vistaril or hydroxyzine.  It is actually an antihistamine but it makes you tired and helps that awful anxiety.   I wish you the best.  It sounds like you have some challenges coming with new roommates and a new job.  Also read the book ""You Are No Alone"" by Ken Duckworth, MD of NAMI.  It is excellent.

If you’re in the US, you may want to look into Auvelity.  It’s an AD that was just approved by the FDA in August of last year.

"Have you tried amitriptyline? It is an older TCA antidepressant but it is the one my previous psychiatrist called the gold standard. I could tolerate only low doses of it, but the 150mg did feel great for the couple of weeks I took it. 

There's a few options in the TCA class of drugs that most doctors rarely use. Doxepin is rock solid for anxious depression with insomnia. Clomipramine is brilliant for depression when there's comorbid OCD. Nortriptyline works well when people need a medication that's stronger on the noradrenaline side of the equation.

An option for TRD is often methylphenidate, aka Ritalin. At the very least it gives people 10-14 hours per day of feeling (really) good. The come down can be harsh, though, so it needs to be used with caution."	introvertfox	reply	na	na	na	0.00473398482427001	no	strong	strong	na	depressionregimens
"I have treatment resistant depression. I’ve all kinds of meds and combinations. IV ketamine treatments did work for a while for me, but they insisted I space them out more. Once I had to get more than 2 weeks without an infusion (eventually out to 6 weeks between my maintenance infusions), it was such a roller coaster. I’d be good for a week after the dose, then slowly crash over the second week and the next 4 weeks I’d be back to zero. It was also super expensive and we just couldn’t afford it anymore, as it’s not covered by insurance. 

My psychiatrist just seemed to kind of blow me off after a while- like because I was functional at some level (I could go to work and keep my kids alive) that my depression was managed enough. She did offer TMS- but I can’t make that kind of schedule work for 6 weeks. Waiting until the SAINT protocol TMS is covered by insurance, because I could make that work. 

Anyways, I switched to a new psych NP who at least seems up to taking on the challenge of helping me- we’ll see what ideas he has. 

It’s rough when nothing is helping, but it helps me to remember that it is fairly common for people to not respond to medication and that really we are crap at treating depression overall.

"Perfectly normal honest post. Life’s a rodeo and man does it takes us all for a ride. Occasionally drags one of us longer than we would want.

This is your duty. I’m clearly not making it justice but the point being is that it’s your destiny. 

If you’re completely overwhelmed reduce your responsibilities. If you live in a household with people see if you can delegate some of your responsibilities to others while you recover. Reduce and simplify has worked wonders in my day to day. Don’t attempt to fix everything or delegate everything all at once. Make small changes and if good keep them then make more changes when you’re ready. Remember that you are your best caretaker so feed yourself proper food and see if messy clean up where you spend most of your time. Don’t feel guilty if you have no energy or can’t do more. If you had a car with no gas would you feel bad that it can’t move? Of course not you’d say that car needs gas and then it can move.

"Gabapentin withdrawal was one of the worst experiences of my life, and I’m someone who has dealt with intense drug withdrawals before (fentanyl, xanax, oxycodone, amphetamines) and nothing has come close to comparing to gabapentin withdrawal.
After being off it 8 days (I was told by my doctor there were no dependency concerns & that I could stop cold Turkey just fine) muscles in my neck swelled & partially blocked blood flow causing me to lose my hearing entirely. The doctors in the ER had never seen this before, but given that was the only substance I was on/had discontinued they saw it as the culprit. They had no idea if my hearing would return. Thankfully, about a week later, it did, but I developed nasty tinnitus. 
This is of course not even mentioning the other horrid effects of the withdrawal like insomnia, auditory hallucinations (prior to the loss of hearing) supreme panic attacks and anxiety, seizures, raised BP & a sensation someone was sitting on my chest.
I did not sleep more than an hour or two a day for 20-some days. Nothing has broken me like gabapentin did. 
I’m not saying everyone will have this result, but please take caution when discontinuing it & make sure to drop your dose gradually- no more than 300 mg every 5 days."	RichAf26	reply	na	na	na	0.5297603011131287	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"So when I was put on it, back in 2016, it was relatively new in the sense of being used off-label in addiction medicine. The max dosage was also much, MUCH higher back then. I was placed on it when I went to rehab (primarily for opiate & benzo dependence) and the rehab was less than ethical— they had a tendency to discharge patients on 15+ new medications minimum & diagnose people with disorders during the initial stage of withdrawal which is directly mentioned as being a no-no in the DSM-5 due to withdrawal symptoms mimicking many disorders. 

ANYWAY, sorry— got off track.
The moral of the story is I was on 3600 mg a day. Half the time the nurses would give me extra. I spent the next, shit, 5-6 years on it. Starting in 2019 I began trying to stop & was told repeatedly by my doc that there were no issues with stopping cold Turkey. I would never make it past the 10 day mark, usually 4-5 days at most. 
It wasn’t until February of 2021 I said fuck it, went full-metal, and flushed all of it & told my doc & pharmacy never to give me more.

…and when I tell you I lost full contact with reality I truly mean it. I cut my knee open with an exacto knife (you know, those slanted blades on a silver pencil-like handle?) because I was convinced my knee had “too much fluid in it.” That was on day 6 I think? At that point, the lack of sleep had gone from annoying to making the air vents in my house whisper to me in disembodied voices. 
As mentioned, I went deaf for a bit, which considering the voices I was hearing at least eliminated that issue.
However, I still could not sleep. 
And by that point, having gone thru that much, there was no turning back in my mind. I can be stubborn as fuck, and I was. The doctors I saw in the hospital when I lost my hearing kept trying to have me take a small dose again but I refused repeatedly. 
In total, according to an old calendar I saved from that year, I went 22 days without sleeping more than an hour a night. 

I thought heroin & fentanyl & Xanax withdrawal was the worst hell possible, and it just goes to show me that it isn’t a contest— there isn’t a “worst” withdrawal, they all suck in their own unique, shitty way, but unquestionably the withdrawal that scares me the most to consider ever experiencing again is gabapentin. 
Maybe it’s because I went into it naively, whereas I knew when I was using that there was going to be a bumpy landing, to put it mildly.
But I believed the rehab that it was a “non-addictive” substance & that I had nothing to fear, so when the bottom dropped out it shook me a bit more.
It almost had the combined effects of an opioid detox & a benzo/alcohol detox rolled into one. Neither of the those two had made me hallucinate before though and gabapentin sure as fuck did. I can still mentally hear the whispers in my memory when I look at my bathroom air vent. 
It changed the way I looked at pharmaceuticals forever, and while I know it helps many people & I know this is all just an anecdotal experience, I always feel compelled to share it for the people who, like me in 2016, are being told there’s no risk of withdrawal if you stop, even abruptly.

I think this has a lot to do with expectations. Every med I’ve taken over the last 20 years ‘worked’ to some extent. Nothing has put me in remission. However, that is totally possible.

Started experiencing depressive symptoms in the 7th grade, then the manic symptoms started my freshman year of High school. After this, the same year, I dealt with two different instances of trauma months apart. After that I was in a depersonalized state for a very long time. And I also started developing severe anxiety symptoms I didn’t have before. So, I want to say close to the end of the year I was put on meds. I was 14, nothing worked until I was 19 and it was vraylar. Buspar kind of worked for the anxiety but I’m guessing you want what helped the depression. Vraylar worked very very well, but it also made me gain weight very very well. So I went off of it but was still on lamictal and buspar. Just recently I started trintellix and that has helped a whole bunch. And I’m 20 now, so about 6 years give or take. I still have bad days though, but everyone does.

Meds I’ve tried are, zoloft, prozac, Wellbutrin, lamictal (which doesn’t really do much but I have to take it if I’m taking anything else for mood), vraylar, abilify, and probably some other things I forgot.

Yea I wish you good luck. There’s also a lot of other things that aren’t meds that you can do. The main ones that work for me are exercise and meditation. I try to exercise everyday and I feel almost cured after. That being said it doesn’t work every time. My theory is that the adrenaline dump does something good for my brain. With meditation I just relax and listen to meditation music. With my goal being to have zero thoughts. I usually just turn my thoughts into the sound of the music if that makes any sense. Can’t feel bad if you literally have no thoughts. Hope that’s helpful.	Royal_Principle_8656	reply	na	na	na	0.9994982481002808	weak	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"Hi all! I’ve been struggling with a brutal depressive episode lately and as such, this has greatly affected my sleep. I’ve been taking a prescribed dose of 10mg Zolpidem for sleep but am wary of becoming dependent.

This is where Mirtazapine comes in. I’m currently on 75mg Desipramine and 150mg Lithium for depression and wondering if it’s safe to take 7.5mg Mirtazapine instead of the Zolpidem for insomnia. 

From researching online, Amitriptyline and Mirtazapine should be safe to take together but I’ve not seen anything about Desipramine and Mirtazapine. Seems like it should be fine since Desipramine has even a lower serotonergic effect than Amitriptyline. Anyone have any input? Thanks."

"Anyone got experience with runners high?

I'm trying to incorporate health routines in my behaviors.  One of them is daily exercise.  I make myself to do one type of exercise a day.

I just came back from a long run: 2 hours and +10 miles.  I tried to run myself until exhaustion to achieve so called runners high. I felt nothing.  Yeah well only pain but nothing of that sweet endorphin and dopamine release.

Is this because of the anti anxiety med?  I red somewhere that runners high is releasing hormones from the same region the fight or flight response is coming from.

Could it be this runners high is suppressed by lexapro / wellbutrin?  Or am i simply not able to feel it because of the depression.  I feel disappointed.  its hard to keep motivated when it doesn't feel good :(

**TL:/DR: heavy cardio does not give runners high or any good feeling like it used to.  Is because of medication?  Or depression?  Your experiences?**

The Justification was that the medicine is anti inflammatory and depression can be a form of inflammation."	Drug-Nerd	post	36.04707964420624	male	White	0.9950075149536133	na	na	na	17	depressionregimens
"“Minocycline – For patients with treatment-refractory depression, multiple randomized trials indicate that the antibiotic minocycline may be beneficial [51]. A meta-analysis of three trials compared minocycline (200 mg/day) with placebo, either as add-on therapy or monotherapy, in 151 patients with depressive syndromes [37]. Improvement was greater with active drug and the clinical effect was large; however, heterogeneity across studies was moderate to large. Another meta-analysis of the same three trials also found a clinically large, beneficial effect favoring minocycline over placebo, and that adverse effects were comparable for the two groups [52].
In one of the more recent and longer trials, which compared add-on minocycline with placebo in 41 patients for 12 weeks, nearly all of the patients had been depressed for at least one year [53]. All patients were currently treated with antidepressants (primarily SSRIs) and most patients were also receiving adjunctive medications such as second-generation antipsychotics. Response (reduction of baseline symptoms ≥50 percent) occurred more frequently with adjunctive minocycline than placebo (63 versus 22 percent of patients).
Some clinicians have emphasized that anti-inflammatory drugs such as minocycline should be reserved for patients with signs of increased inflammation, as indicated by elevated inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein [38]. Evidence supporting this approach includes a four-week randomized trial that compared add-on minocycline (200 mg/day) with placebo in 39 patients with treatment-resistant depression plus low-grade inflammation, defined as C-reactive protein serum concentration ≥1 mg/L. Although the benefit of minocycline and placebo was comparable, among patients with C-reactive protein ≥3 mg/L, improvement was greater with minocycline.”"	Drug-Nerd	reply	na	na	na	0.9950075149536133	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

I took it for a while, it seemed to help a little, I think the research I found say CRP values higher than 3 are most likely to benefit.

People don’t become antibiotic resistant, bacteria do. Meaning that resistance is a phenomenon in a bacterial population caused by the general use of antibiotics, not one patients’ use.

I have major depression/major anxiety. I was originally on a celexa/lamictal/Wellbutrin combo up until this past March/April time frame when my doctor and I finally narrowed it down to just the lamictal. Since then my dosage has been slowly upped to 300mg, which is what I’m currently taking. I also recently started buspirone (about a month ago) to help with anxiety. Over the course of the past few years, I haven’t had any luck with SSRIs, so getting on the lamictal was a breakthrough for me mood-wise. However, I have noticed that since coming off of celexa and Wellbutrin, as well as having the lamictal dose upped so high, that my sex drive has basically vanished. I’ve tried to do research online and have come back with mixed results of whether a decreased sex drive is a side effect of Lamictal. Just wondering if anybody else has had this experience with the medication and if it’s some thing that eventually went away, or it’s still an ongoing problem.

Of what we know it is likely one or both of these: Aceclofenac, Paracetamol. It could be one of the others but I am not aware of any documentation on anything related to anxiety based on their actions. Doesn't mean there isn't, just no data. Aceclofenac suppresses inflammation. Inflammation has been shown to be linked to clinical depression in some cases. Reducing inflammation is a target of antidepressant research currently due to it, and COX-2 inhibitors have shown some effects. Paracetamol affects the enndocannibinoid system. We don't know everything it does but that system can play a role in anxiety. Those are your likely candidates.	Drug-Nerd	reply	na	na	na	0.0028561262879520655	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens

I’ve tried the medications Zoloft, Fluvoxamine, Prozac, Effexor, Clomipramine, Wellbutrin, Buspar, Lorazepam, Lexapro, Vyvanse and Abilify.

Did anyone else discontinue their meds (SSRI/SNRI) because they thought it was the cause of their emotional numbness/blunting only to find out it was the depression itself? I’ve been on 3 different serotonin enhancing meds over the past 4 years and encountered 2 depressive episodes. Lexapro seemed to help for my first episode and I was in remission for 3 years but upon my second episode I had to switch to Effexor and prozac which haven’t helped me achieve remission this time (been going on for almost 15 months). The constant anxiety and despair/low mood was went away pretty easily into the new treatment but I just can’t seem to get emotions back/enjoy anything I normally would. I’m also pretty apathetic as well. At least when depression hit I was able to be sad and feel negative emotions. Point is, I’ve been off prozac completely for 21 days and have noticed no differences as far as emotion/enjoyment in activities. Could it be the depression? Or it is not enough time? Should I try another med? I’d like to stay off if possible because I know they’re not the best for long term treatment. Any advice is much appreciated!

"I had been prescribed one med after another for 20+ years. And then they’d try adding other meds on top of antidepressants. None of it ever really worked and so I finally decided I was done with it. I tapered off meds and my depression got worse. But I didn’t think I needed to go back on them. I think it was withdrawal. My body has been used to having my hormones/chemicals messed about with for so long, I think it needed time to get back to “normal”. 

I knew I’d still be depressed. I was depressed before the meds. But I figured I’d rather be depressed without meds than depressed taking meds that didn’t work. 

Things got so bad, I ended up getting ECT and was inpatient at a psychiatric hospital for 5 months. 

I did start to feel better. But the doctors insisted that I go back on antidepressants because of a study that showed it helped prevent relapse. AND they believed that the meds must have been doing something since my depression got worse after stopping. I did not agree with their logic but they said I’d be going against medical advice. I finally relented and started taking them. It can be really difficult to say no to medical professionals…

Within a week, my mood started to go down and my energy level started falling and so they gave me a couple ECT boosters. But it didn’t work. 

Then they put me on adderall to increase my energy level (another med I had gotten off before)

Eventually I was back to where I had started — back on the same meds I was before I stopped meds and was hospitalized. I was frustrated and I felt vindicated. Antidepressants had cancelled out any benefit I had gotten from the ECT. It was like it never happened, except for fucking with my memory. 

After about a year, I made my final decision to get off of antidepressants. Because I now felt certain that I’d feel the same whenever I was on an antidepressant or not. But this time, I only went off the antidepressant. Last time I got off antidepressant & adderall around the same time and that might have been too much at one time. 

I tapered off antidepressant. And once I got over the physical withdrawals, I didn’t feel any different. Nothing changed. So I was right about the antidepressant. I had been on them for decades and they hadn’t done a damn thing. 

Unfortunately, I am still on adderall. I know that will be a difficult process because my energy level will get worse before hopefully leveling off and I don’t know if I can handle that right now. But I hope to eventually. 

But I wouldn’t even be on it, if I hadn’t given in to going back on antidepressants in the first place. 

I’m sorry this has been long. But I hope my experience helps you figure out what’s best for you. Sometimes the doctors don’t know any more than you do. They’re taking shots in the dark as well. It’s all trial and error. I should have trusted my instincts the first time but we’re taught to believe that the doctors know best. But when it comes to meds, it’s usually a guessing game."

Completely relate to this. Over 15 yrs of 40-50 diff drugs that haven’t worked. Started tapering off over a year ago. Still on 4 meds and expect it it take years before I’m completely off. Even with this slow, psychiatrist approved taper, I’ve had withdrawal symptoms the entire time (mostly from benzo).

"Yeah, wanting to do psychedelics is partly why I wanted to get off antidepressants in the first place as well. But withdrawal is difficult for sure. My combo before first detox was an antidepressant, benzo for anxiety, and a stimulant so I didn’t sleep all day. Got off the antidepressant. I wanted off the stimulant because I hated dealing with a controlled substance. And if I missed a day, I’d be completely worthless and lethargic that day. So I thought going off of it would mean I’d just go back to being tired all the time…And my doctor made it seem like stopping adderall/vyvanse wouldn’t be a big deal. But it was the opposite and it really fucked me up. I couldn’t sleep anymore and I was very agitated and couldn’t stop pacing. And I think it was the lack of sleep that really made me spiral. 

This time, I hope to very slowly lower my dose of adderall/vyvanse over a very long time. But it’s scary and I haven’t fully committed to it yet. Sleep has always been a way to escape for me. So not having that terrifies me… 

I’m on .25mg of Klonopin a day. I’ve heard of but haven’t actually to get off of benzos yet… I’m a bit scared of the withdrawal… plus I still have high anxiety, but I’m also scared of having been on it for so long… 

I did 6 IV sessions of Ketamine. I’m considering giving it another try… I would like to do psilocybin, just don’t have a source…and I’d like to do it with a therapist and that’s difficult to find since it’s illegal in my state…

"I've been doing high dose ketamine troches for abt 8 months. It's helped with my benzo withdrawal symptoms and chronic pain, but not the depression, which is what it was intended for. I got off adderal soon after I started my valium taper bc stimulants make benzo w/d symptoms so much worse for me.    

I’m down to 1.5mg of Valium and am holding at that dose to try to get some stability since I’ve been pretty much non-functional since the pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic I went off all my psych meds cold turkey (biggest mistake of my life) and ended up back on most of them after 6 months of indescribable withdrawal horror. I went off them bc I had just gotten put on my 7th or 8th med and they weren't helping so I wanted to see what my ""baseline"" was.  

A few years after I started all this medication I realized I had been going through perimenopause when I started the meds. I was in my early 30's so it went undetected until I hit full menopause, but it makes me wonder how much of what I was going through was hormonal. I also started intensive therapy at that time so, it kills me to think that adding hormones instead of all these meds could've been the answer.  Just a variation of common story for so many of us, unfortunately... 

Since the pandemic I haven’t been able to “re-enter” life, if that makes sense. I have to get back out and do things…work, be around people, function as a person in society.

I was put on pramipexole too. It didn’t do anything for me. Adderall & vyvanse are both controlled substances. So it’s annoying as fuck making sure you get a prescription in at the right time, etc. it’s a hassle. And I don’t think it will affect your emotions. So I’d advise against it.

I think antidepressants can make blunt some people’s ability to feel extremes in emotions. But depression can also do that. I’ve never achieved remission with any medication I took. For me personally, I’ve given up on finding the magic pill that will make me better. But you’ve had some success. So I don’t know what’s right for you. But I would try something else first, if I had it to do over again. I’d try ketamine or psychedelic therapy. It’s not cheap, or easy…But if it’s financially feasible, I’d look into it.

That makes sense, I just feel kinda empty emotionally/physically if that makes sense. Even a little worse than when I started tapering which makes me think I just need time to adjust but aren’t most of my symptoms (numbness/anhedonic/apathetic) more associated with dopamine?

"Well, it sounds like you’re saying you can’t feel emotions? So you can’t feel joy or any positive feelings? And you can’t feel any negative feelings, sadness, or anger, etc? 

Personally, I haven’t experienced total lack of feeling. I don’t think I’ve ever been truly happy. But I can laugh, and there have been times when I enjoyed things. Right now, I don’t get much joy in anything…I look forward to sleep and oblivion. I can feel deep sadness and loneliness. 

I can try to ignore my feelings. I do that by distracting my brain. I listen to audiobooks because I don’t want to think. I don’t want to think. Because if I let myself, I’ll cry at the drop of a hat. I cry reading the newspaper. I cry watching tv. Anything sad happens, I tear up. But I’m ok with crying at sad things. But I still try to avoid thinking about my own shit too much. Prior to about a week ago, I tried not to think about my life period… But lately, I’ve been letting shit out more on here. I talk about my past trauma, but I’m usually doing it at a slight distance. But I know, if I let myself really think about it…I could fall apart, and I’m trying to keep it together…


In my other reply, I mentioned psychedelics. I got some pure LSD and I did a trip at home. I made myself comfortable. I had a sitter there just to be safe. And I listened to John Hopkins Psychedelic Journey playlist on Spotify. I think it’s meant for psilocybin, but whatever. When the LSD fully kicked in, I cried for 30 minutes straight. It just poured out of me and I couldn’t stop. There was so much sadness I felt physically weighed down by it. And I felt very sad for a lot of the experience. And I felt very sad the next day. It was not an uplifting experience. I don’t necessarily regret it, and I would do it again…but it wasn’t what I had hoped for.

So if you really want to cry… acid might do the trick… I don’t know for sure. But it’s not guaranteed to be a quick fix either.

"While this wasn't the plan, I just didn't tolerate the following meds over the last 4 months: Modafinil, Luvox, Clomipramine, Abilify. So that's left me with just Lamictal.

I have a Spravato consult on Friday. I have also tried Joyous ketamine but their QC is terrible and the efficacy of recent packs has been all over the place. Mostly very minimal ketamine. I do feel like the low dose ketamine helps with anxiety and did pull me out of severe suicidal ideation last week.

What else can I do aside from ECT or TMS? Like I said, I am pushing for an MAOI. I have also asked to try Nefazadone and have been told no.

Lamictal did not help me. The way my doctor described it is that it brings you to your baseline and keeps you there. If your baseline is higher that's great and you won't go too high or low, but if your baseline is low then you're screwed.  My baseline is low, so all it did was keep me there.

"You may try to combine medical treatment nutrition, exercise and philosophy reading. (not kidding) 

For Lamictal, There are some studies which show its benefits even at dosage as low as 25 mg, when used along with ssris/snris in unipolar depression. (More is not ""always"" better though, it may just mean more side effects) 

Lamictal has some potent therapeutic effects on glutamatergic system, which is shown to involve in depression, including unipolar depression. For that reason, it may help and there are reports of it. But, each of us individually is unique and it is always good to discuss such things with a psychiatrist.

[Ten studies were included in the review (n=289 patients), including one randomised controlled trial (RCT), two randomised comparative open-label studies, two comparative open-label studies, two open-label studies and three retrospective chart reviews. The sample sizes ranged between 14 and 42 patients.

One RCT (n=23) was included in the review including 15 patients diagnosed with unipolar depression. The duration of the trial was 42 days. Four patients dropped out of the lamotrigine-treatment arm. The patients were randomly assigned to treatment and the trial used double-blinding. The analyses performed in the trial were conducted on a last-observation-carried-forward basis. There were statistically significant benefits observed in the RCT with lamotrigine compared to placebo on the CGI scale for severity (2.15 ± 1.28 for lamotrigine compared with 3.40 ± 1.17 for placebo; p=0.0308) and improvement (1.46 ± 0.66 for lamotrigine compared with 2.22 ± 0.83 for placebo, p=0.0341). There were no differences between the groups for mean HAM-D scores, MADRS scores or GAF scores.

The results of three comparative open-label studies showed lamotrigine and lithium were equally effective in lowering depressive symptoms on the HAM-D scale or HADRS. One single group study also reported improvements in outcomes with adjunctive lamotrigine. Two studies reported better tolerability in the lamotrigine groups. One single group study reported a decrease in HAM-D scores for lamotrigine augmentation to venlafaxine, mirtazepine or sertaline. One comparative open-label study found that the addition of lamotrigine to sertraline was associated with improvements on CGI scores after six weeks, but not on HAM-D scores. The three retrospective chart reviews showed response rates with lamotrigine ranging from 40.5 to 76%.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK79680/)"	Evening_Attention_45	reply	na	na	na	0.9983235001564026	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens

"Seems like you have tried almost every antidepressant type out there. But the thing is, Effexor sometimes work for people who had little to no chance with others. It has also higher efficacy rate on average. (I had terrible responses to trintellix, zoloft and had only mediocre response to Cymbalta with loads of side effects. But Effexor.. I responded it much better with much more efficacy and less side effects.)

Then there is Agomelatine. It works well for anhedonic side of depression, and generally increases motivation and hedonic tone. It also has synergistic effect with Effexor Down side? Hard on liver and it was not approved in USA.

It seems you also did not try Mirtazapine/Remeron. It has good synergy with Effexor, combination of them is generally referred to as ""California Rocket Fuel"" 

You may discuss these, especially Effexor and mirtazapine, and possibly Agomelatine depending on where you are. 

Nutritionally, adequate essential nutrients like Magnesium (especially Magnesium), zinc, copper, b vitamins, flavanol and flavanoid intake also play a role on overcoming depression. (Other than magnesium, it best to rely on whole foods for these nutrients.) Also, Zinc, magnesium and folate actually increase efficacy and response rate of antidepressants.

"Fair; but the whole situation will be better if you find a friend/trusted acquaintance who can act as a guide and acquire/grow the stuff yourself. For ME, spending 2k would at minimum counteract some of the benefits of psilocybin 😂, as I'd be less able to relax enough about the situation to have a good trip. 2k+ is simply too high a price - especially considering there are ways to get it yourself and certain places will decriminalize it in the next few years. 

It's like with ketamine: I find it absolutely CRIMINAL anyone charges such prices for an incredibly inexpensive substance and a process that can be done with far less medical training. Still, I definitely get doing whatever it takes to feel mentally well/functional; and no amount of money is too much in doing so (presuming you'll be able to continue living afterwards). I've gone to drastic lengths in the pursuit of mental wellness or at least stability.

Set/setting are everything with psychs/hallucinogens, and also what you do afterwards with the newly gained neuronal connectivity. You just go back to your shitty life, you're probably not gonna appreciate the effects as much/as long.

"What do I do?

apologies bit of a long one, finally telling my story, I will do a tldr at end :)

Male 22 Irish, 68kg , 5' 8

I had a good upbringing, always got treated well by parents except the odd disciplinary issues whenever I acted out, no trauma etc. I work out regularly, I am on decent shape, I would get attention from girls, I would always be in the top achievers in school (went to a grammar school, not sure what US equivalent is) good social life etc (no external stressors) so I am unsure why I am still so unhappy. My main problem is either depression or depersonalisation . First dealt with depersonalization although I didn't know what it was at the time at around the 14, happened on a handful occassions, most notably after physical exertion (dpdr then became chronic at 16) Had my first dealing with a deep depression around 15 years old due to a bad breakup with a girl I felt I loved at the time. I started dabbling with weed and mdma to help numb the pain, I smoked weed for around a year and took mdma for about 3 months and then after one random night I took a hit of a joint I got sent into full fledged dpdr, this has led me to be depressed (cause or symptom of dpdr im not sure in my case). The first few months of this was horrible, I was forced to go to school and I felt like I was going to faint every 5 minutes due to the overwhelming dissociation. In hindsight looking back I am glad I forced myself to continue on with life, the dpdr eventually , well I wouldn't say gotten better, but it faded enough into the background where it wasn't the only thing I had my attention on, atleast after the first 6 months anyway, I had a general feeling of low mood from then on but continued to carry on with life. Was referred to Mental health team and got counselling  (cbt). Tried to teaching me grounding tips for panic attaics when dpdr came on even when I kept reiterating that it was a constant state, not a transient one. Then came 18 where I had hit another low with dpdr, this made me housebound and extremely suicidal. I was prescribed citalopram / celexa and at the time I didn't feel like it workd but looking back it brought me back out of the house within a certain distance ( the dpdr / anxiety made me never leave the house), say maybe 10 mile from my house, a huge improvement on not being able to move 10 metres from my house. At this age I have left school, but the citalopram managed to give me enough courage to start a full time job in which I held for 6 months, at this period, life has become normal. I am working, I am socialising, I am drinking at the weekends (typical ""fitting in"" 18 year old starter pack). I'm still suffering from dpdr at this rate btw. 6 months into the job I have another breakdown. Looking back they feel like burnouts where I just couldn't cope anymore with trying to be normal when inside I felt horrible all the time. I went back to the doctor and he suggested that maybe the citalopram has pooped out and we should start a new SSRI in the form of Fluoxteine, much the same story of citalopram with much more weight gain, was able to go back to education and finish off a college diploma at 19-21 years old, again, still very much in dpdr, depression stilll there but not suicidal per se. At 21 I had enough of the weight gain and decided to come off anti depressants and raw dog the pain, I was feeling shit anyway on them and severely overweight ( went from 11 to 15 stone) , might aswell feel shit and look good atleast lol. Managed to lose 5 stone but still again depressed, anxious and still in dpdr. Fast forward to 22, this is where things took a new hell, I tried to sertraline, worst decision of my life. I sent me to a level of dpdr I have never been before, so deep that I thought I was dead and a literal ghost. I had to stop sertraline as any longer on it I think I genuinely would have ended it all. Anyway 7 months on, still depressed lol. Not sure what to do

Things I've discovered recently that could contribute ; 

• B12 and Folate defeciency, my b12 levels were horrible and folate was even worse, been put on folic acid and b12 injections and cofactors, 2 weeks in no improvement thus far
 • VitD defeciency, taking 5000iu vit d3 with 100mcg k2, just started yesterday so no input on that

Things I have tried;

•Exercise , distracts me for a bit but not a cure
•CBT, meh
•Socialising, similar to exercise

It sounds like you need to talk to a mental health professional who actually takes your problems seriously, and is able to do a diagnostic assessment to figure out if there’s an underlying disorder that affects your thinking, emotions, and your response to medication. CBT is almost always used as a catch-all approach, but a lot of people don’t find it useful. Same can be said for SSRIs. And it sounds like these first-line standard approaches haven’t helped you.	jgrib13	reply	na	na	na	0.013561166822910309	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens
"I'm a grad student, but definitely not an expert. It seems like the research on DP/DR is scant.

I'm seeing some research discussing efficacy of an SSRI combined with Lamotrigine.

Those deficiencies will take a while to correct, particularly B12. I've seen it recommended for people with B12 deficiencies to do 2 injections a week for 2 years. How low were your B12 and D levels? I have a 415 B12 (not quite deficient but far from ideal) and 21 vitamin D as well as a non anemic iron deficiency (ferritin of 35 initially). You might want to get your ferritin checked as well, it's the only way to truly find out if you have an iron deficiency regardless of anemia.	jgrib13	reply	na	na	na	0.013561166822910309	no	strong	strong	na	depressionregimens

Hi yes Vit b seems to be a long road to recovery, the deficiency didn't happen overnight so neither will recovery, my b12 was at 182, folate was at 2.1 :/ , D was at 80pmol/L (optimal should be 240)  Ferritin sitting at 99.6 ug\L which is fine . Getting tested for pernicious anaemia in 2 weeks. Currently on b12 injections every other day for 2 weeks then once every 3 months which I already know won't be enough so will likely self inject if symptoms still there. 415 isn't great and I know if you were supplementing( even drinking b12 drinks or eating fortified b12 cerrals) up to 4 months before testing this will be a skewed result and likely lower, also a high folate result will falsely raise b12 , known as the folate trap, also if folate is low, b12 can't be used at a cellular level.

"Hey! I've recently been diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD). I wanted to share my experiences and seek some advice regarding my treatment journey.

After transitioning from Sertraline to Fluoxetine, I have noticed some improvements in my mental health, especially regarding my OCD symptoms. However, I still face episodes of chronic stress and depression that can be quite debilitating. On these days, I feel overwhelmed and experience feelings of hopelessness. During these episodes, I encounter mood swings, irritability, chronic stress, and agitation. Although Diazepam provides some relief, I am looking for a more sustainable and comprehensive approach to managing these symptoms. 

I have a few questions regarding my current treatment plan. Should I increase my dose of Fluoxetine from 40mg, or would augmenting with Fluoxetine while keeping the dose the same be more effective? I have previously tried Propranolol, Pregabalin, Buspirone, and Promethazine with not much success. 

My symptoms are more psychological than physical, rarely leading to panic attacks. I hope to find ways to address these underlying psychological symptoms effectively.

I am at a loss with the NHS psychiatrist department, as I'm the one doing all the chasing. If anyone has any recommendations or ideas I could present to them, I would be extremely grateful.

Thank you all for your support and understanding."	Calloumi7	post	40.194449538627694	male	White	0.005503735039383173	na	na	na	2	depressionregimens

I don't think in general that psychiatrists do a good job of managing expectations of what medication can do for someone, as well as acknowledging side effects.  They just hear that someone isn't in full remission or whatever and increase the dosage towards max... which sometimes is good, and sometimes is not.

400mg of lamictal is a pretty huge dose.. I'm not surprised you feel better at 200 depending on what you are taking it for.

Oh god, where to begin? 😂 Word recall, short term memory issues, OCD (I’ve always been a bit obsessive but not like this!), CRAZY intense sense of smell that seemed to discover terrible smells everywhere, fatigue, mood swings, rage, lower mood generally, irritability and short temper, impatience, panic attacks, strange fears (I started being afraid of being caught unawares, so my husband now has to announce he’s coming upstairs/approaching the room I’m in 🤦🏻‍♀️😂), anxiety, insomnia, plus once I added Prozac major bloating (which I didn’t have the last time I was on Prozac, when I wasn’t on lamotrigine), sensitivity to the light on my computer screen, and a crazy weird menstrual cycle. I still have a worse temper than I did before and my sleep cycle is a mess, and I definitely don’t feel like I’m 💯 back to who I was, but most of these symptoms have gone or become so much more manageable. I live in an area with hard water, so the water can smell sulphuric and for some reason this is more intense in the dishwasher; at my worst I was pulling out all of the dishes and washing them by hand while fluctuating between wild rage and hysterical crying. No joke. It was a real milestone the other day to realise that when I empty the dishwasher only a few of the dishes reeked of egg and my reaction wasn’t to want to smash everything in sight. So… yeah. This medication truly made me lose my mind 😂😂 NB: all of these things were slight issues before, eg I’ve always had a strong sense of smell and can get super angry, but lamotrigine seems to have amplified them by a thousand.	redditthrowaway19999	reply	na	na	na	0.0016144586261361837	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

First the first month it was like a perfect medication (except for the working memory issues), then gradually my EDS came back even worse. The problem is that I don't want to dose chase with Concerta. I don't want to get addicted and be stuck on like 70 mg and still be tired all day. I'd rather try switching now to modafinil (which I think is arguably a safer medication with much lower addiction risks and possibly greater cognitive benifits).

"I wouldn't try to use a stimulant as a monotherapy for depression. They all more or less top working after a maximum of 14 hours. They need to or else you'd never be able to sleep. Even weaker stimulants like modafinil will make you feel wired.

A stimulant with mirtazapine might work well. Mirtazapine is a good antidepressant, and the increased appetite and daytime drowsiness wouldn't be issues if you're taking a stimulant. It would probably also prevent the anxiety that stimulants can cause.

Treatment-resistant depression is an accepted off-label use for methylphenidate, aka Concerta/Ritalin, but I've not read of it being an accepted off-label use for modafinil. Doctors can prescribe modafinil freely as it isn't a controlled substance, but there's no evidence supporting its use for depression.

"For context:

I'm struggling with depression for some time now.  Most likely +1 year its hard for me to pinpoint an exact date.  I'm in treatment for 5 months now.  Medication wise I'm on Lexapro for 5 months 10 mg.   The last month I'm transitioning to Wellbutrin 150 mg XL.  The reason for this switch is the Lexapro is not effective on all aspects of my depression. While it gave back my sleep and reduced anxiety by a lot, it created some new  ""challenges"".  Mainly lethargy, fogginess in the morning, ( had to get the day started ) and most  importantly,  cravings for instant gratification (dopamine) .  I mean I craved and used caffeine, nicotine,  alcohol.  The latter was the main raison to make the switch.  I was drinking way to much.

Now with Wellbutrin these cravings are curbed and I can handle it I think.

Now for my issue: I have extreme variation in mood during the day.  In the morning I'm really depressed.  I mean depressed like 0 appetite ( I cannot eat I have to wait till later in the day ) really low mood, dark thoughts cloud my mind ""Is this ever going to get better?"".  I having a hard time to be alone, not taking care of myself, the house is a mess too.....  

As the day progresses I'm feeling a bit better by lunchtime.  I started working out every day ( long walks in nature )  but it doesn't really seem to help, or does it?

By the evening I'm starting to feel better.  Sometimes optimistic, I'm making plans again, planning to restructure my life and rebuild what is broken) and by nighttime I'm sometimes so exited that it interferes with my sleep.  I'm almost feeling a bit to energetic, but I know I need to sleep!  I'm getting the munchies, eat unhealthy snacks, thinking about starting to clean the house in the middle of the night.  Real tweaker type behavior shit.  When I do fall asleep the cycle repeats the next day.  Another peculiar thing  I noticed, albeit it could be anecdotal.  I seem to wake up in the morning at exact the same time?  7:38 am .... not 07:37 noy 07:39 but 07:38 on the dot.  And this without looking at the clock all night.  Idk if its related or not, seems to be circadian rhythm related.

Somebody here told me about diurnal variation ( [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/comments/155dry6/comment/jsvbj5p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  ). I can relate 100% to what is said here, apparently its typical for Melancholic depression.  

&#x200B;

**TL/DR: Suffering from diurnal mood, meaning feeling utterly depressed in the morning, it gets better during the day, mood peaks at at night.  Regresses back to low after a sleep.  Apparently its because of  Melancholic depression.  I'm on 5 mg Lexapro and 150 Wellbutrin in the morning. What can I do to level out of mood, if anything?  I think there is something wrong with my sleep idk.  I'm doing 2 hours of cardio (walking/running  a day already.  Could it be because of the meds?  Any experiences? Any insights?**

This might not be very helpful as I differ more from GAD than depression but when I was struggling mornings were always the worst. Filled with dread, unmotivated, exhausted, very negative thinking ect so maybe you could benefit from some of these but what helped me get through it is a mix of time (waiting for new medication to work/therapy to pay off) and lifestyle changes. For me, #1 meditating first thing in the morning the second I open my eyes helped sort of fight off immediate dread about the day, don’t get me wrong meditation is hard at first and can seem like it’s not working but I feel much more clear and like a blank slate afterwards Vs already having a negative perception about the day. #2 Finding something in the morning to look forward to helps. Have a dog? Maybe feeding you dog can be something to look forward too, or your first glass of water that hits the spot, watering flowers or the smell of rain/fresh air. It can be very simple and require no energy but find one thing to look forward to in the morning. #3 Work on that sleep schedule! Having a set evening routine to get your body into sleep mode, less screen time before bed, less sugar or caffeine before bed. Maybe start journaling some of those racing thoughts you described having right before sleep in a journal or quickly in your phone to get them out as well.

Hi, I just replied above with more info about what I've tried and where I got the idea about racetams. I did move to at home ketamine last fall and stayed with that for a few months, but I really didn't like it. The sublingual route felt less effective/the experience itself was rougher and I felt horrible (bad hangover type physical side effects) for hours after the ket was supposed to have worn off. With IV it seems like the dosing is more consistent as far as oral vs. IV absorption, the experience is much smoother, and I'm back to feeling normal within a couple of hours so it doesn't sideline me for a whole day/night.	napsandcaffeine	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9802742600440979	weak	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"I was on 60mg duloxetine, but I experienced a lot of emotional blunting (not sure if there's a medical term for this). I didn't feel nearly as bad, but I also didn't really feel anything at all, just numb. So we backed down to 30 mg last summer. I did some reading about nootropics and saw a study referenced where piracetam improved cognitive function while also significantly reducing concomitant psychopathological symptoms, including depression. I'd have to go back into my phone history and see if I can find the link for that again.

I've been on the following since my first depression diagnosis in 2006 -Doctor prescribed:Prozac, Paxil (stayed on it a few years), Zoloft, Lexapro (stayed on it a few years), Abilify, Latuda (stayed on a few years), some other atypical antipsychotics that I can't remember (always prescribed in conjuction with the SSRIs/SNRIs).Supplements/other things:L-methylfolate (no MTHFR mutation but gave it a shot anyway), B complex, St John's Wort, Omega-3, rhodiola - I'm sure I'm probably missing some things but that's what I can remember right now.

Symptoms - fatigue/low energy, trouble falling and staying asleep, no desire to do any activities other than watch tv or be online, avoiding people & places that I used to/would normally enjoy, forgetful with memory lapses that are not normal for me, trouble focusing, easily irritated/annoyed.I had serious SI to the point of planning until I started ketamine last summer as an emergency/last ditch option & it immediately helped with that. I had pretty good results with ketamine until this May and now I'm not seeing the same benefit - my depressive episodes are always worse in the summer for as long as I can remember.

That is one of the central challenges that all humans face. Philosophers have written countless book about this very thing. Purpose, meaning, and the why of life. There are a variety of answers to pick from but a healthy mind grapples with this questions, analyzes various answers, and has to come to its own conclusions. You can also just accept some of the answers provided.

>doing community college and still live at home.

That's great. You're getting educated and saving money on rent and being around family(they won't be around forever). Lots of young people live with their family. Historically it was the norm, now it's seen as a negative but it's a matter of perspective.

>Just working at a restaurant. 

If you don't enjoy it it's time to pursue something else. Unless it's just a temporary gig for extra money.

I don’t have a lot of anxiety, but the things that have helped my motivation, my “get up and go,” were abilify and ketamine. Though both stopped working after a while. Stimulants haven’t been really helpful for me, though they do help with concentration. Some people say modafinil or a stimulant though.

"Same here, though the Abilify is still working for me. The ketamine had diminishing results towards the end, and combined with the cost, I couldn't justify continuing. However, it was still a noticeable improvement (at least to my therapist) to my mood/affect/word choice even at the end. I think it's because the ketamine did a lot of heavy lifting when I needed it, but once I got to a good point, the benefits after each infusion seemed to diminish--like a logarithmic graph, if that makes sense.

"I guess you could call it “poop out”, or perhaps the body eventually finds a way to adapt to whatever medication you’re on, to maintain homeostasis - even if that homeostasis means feeling sad and depressed.

I was on a solid treatment regime for a good 3 years that effectively squashed my depression.

But, much to my surprise, this last year, that little devil causing the depression has found some way of sneaking back into my mind and biting me again.. despite being on exactly the same treatment regime as before.

It’s almost like the depression is some kind of evil clown / trickster. “You can get away from me, but eventually I’ll learn your tricks and I’ll find a way to catch you again.”

This might make some folks laugh, but I feel it might be worth getting one of these highly rated punchbag, sticking on it a photo of whatever I envision the depression as being (eg. An evil laughing clown) and spend a good 30 minutes each day just beating the living s*** out of it.
- that way, not only do I get my daily dose of physical exercise, but I find a way to externalise my depression into an external bad guy that I can beat up with all my frustration.

That of course whilst working with the doctor to titration my treatment regime to extinguish the depression again."	Remarkable-Worth1709	post	39.543774398912916	male	White	0.011094387620687485	na	na	na	4	depressionregimens
"If someone ever could find the reason for antidepressant medication ""poop out"" and how to prevent or reverse it, that would be a huge relief for millions of us.  I don't think its the brain trying to get back to a depressed state as 'homeostasis"", I certainly didnt have depression before my first panic attack in my 30s and any anxiety was very manageable before then as well without any medication.  I do recognize, however, there are some people who have felt depressed their whole life.  Another related issue is why a medication that worked well and then one goes off and then tries the same one again but it doesnt work so well the second time or a higher dose is needed.  Maybe with the newer treatments coming out like tms, ketamine, psilocibin, and novel antidepressants that work on NMDA receptors, perhaps they can renew sensitivity to the antidepressants.  I also have long wondered that if one is off a particular antidepressant for a long time, would it work well again, for example I have not taken lexapro in about 8 years or more, nor zoloft in at least 20 years, so would either work as well as they did the first time if the need arose?  Seems it should be an easy question to answer if pdocs kept records and reported them to a central agency that could pick up on things that worked vs not.   Or a very long term study like the ones they do for heart disease would also give us better answers.  Too many studies are short term and funded by drug companies, we need longer term studies by non biased entities since many if not most of us take these medications for life more or less once the disorder gets bad enough."

"I'm feeling like I'm like a suitcase with a really rusty wheels. Each time there is an emergency I can push harder and then it's moving for around 30 minutes-3 hours.

Example 1: I suddenly discover an ants swarm in my bed sheets.. It can make me to get up, spray them, change the bed sheets and doing whatever is necessary to correct the issue. But once the situation is over, I get back to bed.

Example 2: My bills are severely overdue and I'm gonna get disconnected from electricity.. it can make me to go and pay the bills.

I somehow managed to hold a full time job for a few years, by my parents being some kind of an ""officer"" holding a ""gun"" at me and threatening to kick me out of the house if I won't work, along with the regular threats at work.. I functioned quite poorly at work but I somehow managed to hold that job.

I would also say it comes with an internal feeling of a lack of inner strength. its like a character manifestation of a ""wuss/a sissy"".

It seems I can only do something in this fucking life only if I get threatened into an emergency. I hate this life. I lost the ability to work and I lost so much hope of anything that I don't even care much of getting thrown to the street because I know I won't amount to anything.

Hello, I am 19M. I have OCD and GAD. I have been prescribed the following with no secondary side effects

Lexapro 20mg (not taking)
Paxil 40mg
Alprazolam (Xanax) up to 1mg a day
Lorazepam 1mg a day
Clonazepam (used to take planning to retake)
Hydroxyzine (used as needed up to 50mg)
Seroquel 75mg daily


I have not yet received any effects from these medications, a bit sleepiness from the amount of sedative medications but nothing that seriously affects me much. I believe I might just have a strong immunity to psych meds and might need to up my dosage which my pyschiatrist was going to do for Clonzapam

For reference I am 5’10 and weigh 153 pounds.

 Vivid dreams might be my only side effect.
I am aware that no side effects doesn’t mean it isn’t working but I have seriously felt nothing from my medications positively, nor negatively just  nothing. There might of been some aid but from all other things I’ve done it seems likely that it’s the later. 

I want to have an actual effect that I can know for certain is from the medications,

I have not done fasting but did do sleep deprivation. That actually does provide relief till you go back to sleep then back at square one. From my understanding fasting is similar meaning you can get some benefits for a short time but once you eat you go back to where you were. That said, having 5 hours of feeling normal with the sleep thing is nice.

"I've been on 2.5 mg aripiprazole for about 1.5 months, have developed extrapyramidal symptoms and had to be taken off of it about 2.5-3 weeks ago.

So, it was decided that the med does not suit me and now I am taking a week break (about 4 days in) from meds before trying lamotrigine. However, my anxiety does not improve and I keep waking up anxious & crying until I take my emergency meds (phenibut). I have experienced something similar after 2 weeks on escitalopram.

Buspirone don’t cause that. It’s a very mild anxiolytic with almost no side effects. It could be Aripiprazole because it’s withdrawal definitely cause anxiety, mood swings, depression. Also you are not on proper medication. Bupropion is also known to increase anxiety in the short term, in long term it definitely helps. I would suggest you to reassess your medications. If you’re depressed , anxious, crying then you must look for something like SSRIs or SNRIs. They are the drug of choice for it. Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic, it can cause severe side effects in the long term and it’s only given if you have treatment resistant depression or if you’re bipolar. Lamotrigine is good for anxiety but again it’s not drug of choice, it’s given in bipolar depression. Bupropion you’re taking on alternate days that’s also not a proper regime.

"Hello, I was wondering if anyone else had this combo.

TL;DR below with main questions.

I'm hoping to get back some of my motivation and focus. I was also told it would help with SI/NSSI and anhedonia. Also struggling with not feeling emotions often/fully, if at all. In the past, I've tried;

50-100mg sertraline - Felt like nothing mattered, ergo I didn't feel stressed by anything, but also caused me to never engage with anything fully. Some side effects, nothing serious. I felt detached, but emotionally turbulent, and still low motivation, fatigue, SI.

100mg sertraline + 100mg bupropion - Similar to the sertraline, but maybe a little more energy. Felt irritable, low patience, and poor task focus. More impulsive, and constantly seeking stimulation.

\--- Went off above cold, took about 3 weeks to regulate back out. Didn't see major improvement in symptoms, and felt very unstable during this time. Instability contributed to continued short temper, low motivation, fatigue. ---

37.5-150mg venlafaxine - inconsistent side effects include night sweats, poor sleep, fatigue, jaw clenching, dry mouth. Motivation, anhedonia, have only gotten worse. Increase in depressed mood, emotional blunting. EDIT: When I try to relax I twitch. This is super irritating, and a major reason I want off it. 

I'm cross tapering to the aripiprazole and desvenlafaxine. I know the desvenlafaxine is chemically similar to the venlafaxine, but I'm not sure if I should expect different results from it. I haven't really had anything I've really liked on any one medication, but I felt like the bupropion + sertraline actually did something, even if it wasn't very good. My psychiatrist can't tell me what anything is supposed to do/feel like or what I should look for.

TL;DR - Will Pristiq act similarly to venlafaxine? What does the Abilify do? What might these feel like? Is the goal of these more ""stability"" or improvement? Thanks in advance."	MissingMyPieceOfMind	post	18.213043863189405	male	White	0.9991483688354492	na	na	na	6	depressionregimens
I take Abilify + Pristiq and I can't say I find the combo to help with motivation or focus. Abilify dulls me out and slows me down a little, but helps SO MUCH with racing thoughts that I think it's worth it.

I have done this combo before (and Wellbutrin with them). I didn’t tolerate the Effexor either, but pristiq was fine- so maybe you will have better luck with the pristiq. Abilify is the one thing that has ever even mildly helped me with motivation and energy, though it is still not satisfactory to me. Switched from pristiq to Trintellix and I honestly think I was doing better on the pristiq, so I might go back to that. Hopefully this combo will lead to improvement- I don’t think the goal with this combo is keeping stability because the abilify is a completely different component/mechanism of action.

"I'm not sure it will happen in 20 years but eventually they will be able to selectively alter specific alleles in the brain using a CRISPR like DNA technology.  Literally cut out the offending allele and replace it with the better variant.   Depression and anxiety involve many genes, some known, some still to be discovered, but we know enough already to find some likely targets and also know which alleles would be better replacements for them.  The hardest part would be how to deliver the dna mixture to the brain only and how to make sure that there is no off target effects on the dna since that can disrupt a different gene which has the potential to cause cancer if its a gene involved in cell replication or its control.  

As for the last 20 years its been slow until recently with TMS, Ketamine and its analogs, new types of antidepressants, and soon magic mushrooms and other things.  These could have been tested a long time ago in many cases so the wait is unjustifiable imo.   TMS has greater potential with better targeting I think.

"I can relate to climbing out of a deep depressive episode. Know that there are no quick fixes and recovery will take time. You are what you so I’m not saying have the perfect diet but make healthier adjustments slowly. If you don’t eat you’re giving your body zero MO to counter the effects of depression and the better you eat the better you’ll be able to cope. 

I can relate to not feeling happy despite important milestones being met. The reason for that is that you have that cloud hanging over your head. To help fix it I suggest look up Daniel Mackler on YouTube he’s a former psychotherapist and I think he has the best insight into therapy or processing your life. He even talks about self therapy which I have found very useful. 

Again I can’t overemphasize that it takes time. You’re basically steering a giant ship in a different direction.

It seems to me that there is no way to treat these two symptoms together. Mirtazapine for example could help me with the nausea and low appetite but it could make me sleep even more. Whereas Bupropion could help my hypersomnia, but could increase nausea and lower appetite.

Hi. I have been on lexapro for a little over a year for depression and GAD. It worked extremely well for my anxiety at 10 mg. I am also on Wellbutrin 300 XL which has been an absolute miracle drug for me depression. This all sounds great but I literally could not feel my lady parts during sex if I had sex at all because I had no interest in it. I expressed this to my doc who suggested we try 5 mg. Now my sex drive is mostly back, still not where it was but much better, but my anxiety has been god awful. Physical anxiety symptoms back, worrying to the point that I make myself sick. It feels super unfair that I should have to make a choice between being anxious all the time and having a sex life. I have an appointment with my doctor in 2 weeks where I’ll obviously discuss this with him, but I would be open to trying another drug entirely to manage my anxiety without having to sacrifice my sex life. Also, coming off of Wellbutrin or lowering the dose is not something I’m willing to do.  Has anyone been through something similar? What did you do to combat this? Any drugs I should ask my doctor about?	Ok-Improvement-2104	post	30.09687969507431	male	White	0.9962676167488098	na	na	na	15	depressionregimens
"Unfortunately, you're out of luck if your main issue is anxiety.**SSRIs** are the first-line and they're very effective. But all of them come with sexual side effects. You could try fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, fluvoxamine, sertraline but THEY ALL come with sexual side effects - Delayed orgasm being among the most common.

Dose change is not going to help you a lot. For them to be effective they need to bind to at least 70-80% of your Serotonin Transporter - Less than that and you may not get an effect.

Some exceptions in the SSRI category could be **VORTIOXETINE** \- I am on it. 10mg. No sexual side effects. Great for depression - less so for anxiety. There are not enough studies but it doesn't look great for anxiety.

Your best bet could be

1. **Agomelatine -** 5HT2C antagonist and MT1/2 Agonist - Helps with both depression and anxiety - To what effect for anxiety? Not sure. but it's helpful
2. **Tianeptine -** This is an opioid like antidepressant. Very interesting but depending on where you are, it's not available in U.S.
3. **Vilazodone** may be a decent choice, although I'm not familiar with it - not available where I live.

That's it kinda - unfortunately. I doubt there are many other options. Other classes of antidepressants that help with anxiety come with sexual side effects.

You could also try **BUSPIRONE** which is not an antidepressant but an anxiolytic which requires around 2-4 weeks to work. Its effects vary. For me, it was meh. This one could actually HELP your sexual function as well in addition to its anxiolytic.

OR if you want something more effective - that would help almost instantly - **PREGABALIN** \- Good anxiolytic - usually preferred to benzos - not as effective as benzos but it's great. I like it. Worth a try.

Also, Wellbutrin is not contributing to your sexual side effects. In fact, Wellbutrin should help with that. So even if you'd cut the dose, that'd be pointless.

Good luck

EDIT: I Guess there are other options such as antipsychotics - quetiapine and aripiprazole but honestly they come with terrible side effects"	Ok-Improvement-2104	reply	na	na	na	0.9962676167488098	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens

I had the same thing happen to me with 10mg of lexapro years ago . I had zero interest in sex whatsoever . My husband would get frustrated and totally understandable . It def took my anxiety away tho and made my brain feel normal . It was a battle of loving that my anxiety was gone but the zero sex desire was affecting my marriage . I ended up getting off of it . Flash to years later .. my mom died and my anxiety was back with a vengeance so i got back on lexapro . It wasn’t working like it did in the past so my dr up to 20mg and added buspar. I’m feeling great and shockingly it has not affected my sex drive at all ! Only thing I’ve noticed is a slight increase in appetite but I’ll take it !

"Hello fellow Redditors,

I hope you are all doing well. I come seeking some advice on medication transitioning, particularly regarding Clomipramine and Moclobemide. Before I begin, I want to clarify that I'm not a medical professional, just someone seeking some insights from those who might have experienced similar situations.

Recently, I made the decision, in consultation with my healthcare provider, to wean off Clomipramine, an antidepressant that I have been taking for a while. Now, my doctor has recommended starting Moclobemide, another antidepressant, as an alternative treatment.

However, I forgot to ask my doctor about the recommended waiting period between stopping Clomipramine and starting Moclobemide. I understand that both of these medications work differently, and there might be interactions or adjustments needed.

So, I wanted to ask those of you who have gone through a similar medication transition:

1. How long did you wait after weaning off Clomipramine before starting Moclobemide?
2. Did you experience any side effects or complications during the transition process?
3. Were there any specific guidelines or precautions your doctor provided during the switch?

Of course, I will reach out to my healthcare provider again to seek professional advice, but I believe it's also essential to hear from people who have firsthand experience with these medications.

Please remember that everyone's medical situation is unique, and it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. This discussion is meant to share personal experiences and insights, not to replace medical advice.

My question is- how do you know if you can stop taking SSRIs? Do you just slowly taper off and see if your symptoms return?

I am really interested in the effects of Selegiline. How would you describe its antidepressant effects? Does it give you energy, drive, motivation, pleasure? And what does it do for executive functioning (memory, attention, concentration, reasoning, mental operations)?

"Auvelity is expensive, but you might be able to get it for free.

I’ve been trying to get Auvelity covered my my insurance since shortly after it was FDA approved, but in general insurance companies aren’t covering it at all. And I don’t qualify for the savings card because I’m on Medicaid.

I go to Greenbrook for Spravato (esketamine) and TMS. The psychiatrist who oversees my treatment there had a great tip. She said that she made a connection with a drug rep at Axsome who provides her with samples for patients who can’t afford the medication. These samples are of course free and unlimited indefinitely to patients Auvelity works well for, basically until the cost goes down or a generic is released. She said that the company is happy to do this because it’s such a new medication and they want it to get out there and become more well known, and for psychiatrists to see how effective it can be, therefore prescribe it more.

When I told my general psychiatrist about this, she was able to get me samples very quickly. I now have a four month supply. (Not starting it until I finish my TMS, though.)

So if you want to try this medication and you can’t afford it, ask your psychiatrist to reach out to an Axsome drug rep. I’d just recommend verifying that the samples will be provided indefinitely, because you wouldn’t want to find something that works only to have it be taken away someday.

Also, on Amazon there is a pill available that is 30mg of dextromethorphan freebase. Auvelity is 105mg bupropion SR with 45 mg dextromethorphan HBr, but 30 mg of dextromethorphan freebase is equivalent to 41 mg of dextromethorphan HBr, so pretty close. Bupropion is cheap, you can get two 100mg SR tableta from your doc, and the dextromethorphan freebase on Amazon is ~$24 for 100 pills.	mycertaintyiswild	reply	na	na	na	0.00180461211130023	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens

"Hey everyone,

I am not a fan of SSRIs, mainly because of the sexual side effects (been on prozac for 6 months) but also because it can cause emotional blunting?!

My flavor of depression is mostly anhedonia and disgust and boredom - I can't get pleasure from anything. Nothing seems fun. I am not interested in my old hobbies. And I am in a state of excruciating boredom - nothing to do now, nothing to look forward to.

When it gets worse, I get disgust. Not only I don't enjoy things, but I feel disgust towards them - aversion - even when playing video games.

I detailed this because depression is not monolithic - some people have other forms such as intense sadness, regret, self-loathing, hopelessness, etc. Mine seems to be a bit more dopaminergic in nature (I have and I take methylphenidate but it doesn't always help)

**Okay let me get to the point already.**

**I have been taking VORTIOXETINE for 2 months already - Started at 10 mg for a month and went to 15 and 20 (since the manufacturer recommends 20 for better effects)**

Problem with this is - It's still an SSRI even though it has other effects - and while at 10 mg it didn't give me any sexual side effects, I have prozac-like sexual side effects at 15 and 20.

On the other side, **Agomelatine is known to be effective for anhedonia** and it doesn't cause ANY side effects.

**Tianeptine is a bit different** since it works on opioid receptor but it also doesn't cause sexual side effects and I have a 2-month worth supply (never tried it) when my previous psychiatrist recommended it.

So I can either stay at a subpar dose of Vortioxetine (10mg) which I think has worked to some extent, or switch to Agomelatine, or switch to Tianeptine.

**Thoughts?**

"After being on Abilify for approximately 2 month, I initially started with a dosage of 2 mg for about two weeks. Then, my dosage was increased to 4 mg, which led to experiencing extreme boredom and inner restlessness. To address this, I decided to cut the 5 mg tablets in half, so I've been taking 2.5 mg for some time now.

However, after taking my Abilify, I suddenly felt a wave of depression wash over me. Despite trying to distract myself by watching a movie or TV show, the inner restlessness persisted, making it difficult to find solace.

When it worked, it was awesome.  But I am treatment resistant, have tried almost everything under the sun, and have had no luck.  It may be great for you.  I would definitely give it a shot.

I took it for a couple of weeks recently and it made me feel like I was being zapped when I had feelings, lexapro did the same thing for me and I’ve never heard of anyone else having that side effect.

"It definitely helps my mood, and compared to other SSRI type of meds, it feels more mild (good thing for me).  Never had sexual side effects really.. works quickly.  

I've gone on and off it a few times because initially it really makes me feel a lot better.. but after a few weeks I feel oddly more anxious on it.  My doctor says akathisia is more common with trintellix/viibryd and they're trying to go more low and slow with them for that reason... dunno.

Getting on and off it is way less of a commitment than traditional SSRIs or SNRIs, so I'd give it a shot.  They say it's 2 weeks to feel effects vs like 6 for prozac/lexapro."	Flimsy-Baby3089	reply	na	na	na	0.006788099184632301	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"Please be gentle.  


Had a breakdown. Going through one, more accurately lol. Self care became really hard and I didn’t have the motivation to take my medications. So I’m in a space and I’m going to admit to my doctors what happened.
I will be be getting professional advice and I’m taking a lot of different paths for that. So I’m confident I’ll be getting support in medically appropriate ways and I’ll follow their advice.  

In the meantime, before my next appointment (next week), I need to start taking meds again. 

So I’m looking for any insights on what to reset. I don’t want to take as many meds. I need to cut some out so I’m grateful for any thoughts or experience. 

I’m prescribed: 

Lamictal - 200 mg twice daily 
Abilify- 5 mgs 
Cymbalta - 60 mgs 
Wellbutrin - 450 mgs 
Trintellix - 10 mgs  
(Unrelated to depression but relevant for anxiety) Gabapentin - fuck ton. 

As needed: 
Xanax 
Ambien 

So I think I am going cut Abilify and Cymbalta. 

My plan is to restart the Lamictal, Wellbutrin, and Trintellix as my daily meds and see how those work.  

Any insights into this combo would be helpful!"	hothouseflowers	post	35.77728954343715	female	White	0.010017072781920433	na	na	na	5	depressionregimens
"Oof. So sorry you’re going through this. How long have you been off your meds and how bad are your withdrawal symptoms? I think that makes a big difference in your decision. 
I did this same thing 3 yrs ago with the 5 or 6 psych meds I was on at the time and it was the worst decision of my life. Went thru almost intolerable withdrawal for 6 months before reinstating some meds and now am slowly tapering off which still sucks but is way more tolerable. If you haven’t been off of the meds long, I’d recommend getting back on them or you’re just setting yourself up for a hellish time or possibly kindling if you end up back on them and try to taper later.  Hang in there…

Edited to add: At the time I was on 30mg Valium, 450 bupropion, 20mg Trintellix, adderall, topamax, naltrexone and has just started lithium. Had been dealing with TRD for 15 yrs with no relief from meds and finally thought “fuck it.”  No idea what I was setting myself up for.

"Started Lexparo lately. 

The sexual side effect that always gets me (34M) is delayed ejaculation and/or (in worst cases!) anorgasmia. 

I know that Wellbutrin is the go to for this but I find that it undoes most of the anxiety benefits of the Lexapro. 

Anything else out there's that's relatively easy to get a prescription for and/or supplements? 

I watched a good video about anorgasmia last night and from what I gathered anything that helps in the dopamine department should be useful in this respect."	danielrosehill	post	25.371223149908033	male	White	0.9977739453315735	na	na	na	5	depressionregimens
Maybe mirtazapine eg 15mg? It’s relatively easy to get prescribed for insomnia. It antagonizes the 5HT2C receptor which supposedly mediates some of the sexual sides of SSRIs. I haven’t used it with an SSRI but when I first started it I noticed it was much easier to reach orgasm. YMMV.	danielrosehill	reply	na	na	na	0.9977739453315735	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"first day of modafinil today. took 100 mg around 10 am with food. i didn’t think it was even doing anything except for giving me a slight pressure headache and making me feel tired so i added a cup of coffee (usually drink 2-3 cups per day) around 12:30 and felt the effects of the caffeine and maybe a little more awake than usual. the rest of the day since around 2 or 3 has just not been great. feeling more depressed and more hopeless. as well as i just feel not all the way there? idk how to explain it, sorta akin to the dissociation i get sometimes when smoking weed. as well as i acted more out of character i guess today, kinda went off onto someone online who was being annoying but i usually just keep scrolling but today i just kinda had enough idk. just pretty uncharacteristic of me. i know drugs like this are pretty instant when it comes to seeing results and such since they don’t need to build up in your system like an ssri does. is it even worth continuing with?

Research says it can help people with depression or it can cause depression to become worse and cause suicidal thoughts. I def don’t think it’s worth taking if it made you feel like that .

Seemed ok at first . Now he is dabbling in drugs again, still on the wakealert/Modafinil, suicidal at times and is soooo off the charts we never know what person we’re gonna get. It’s really sad.

It actually made me feel worse when the antidepressant effect of my major med was low. At times when the major antidepressant effect was substantially high, Modafinil propelled better condition.

"Modafinil is very dose sensitive.   The difference between 50 and 100 for me is huge.  Try 50mg.   

I think, though, you might be feeling withdrawal from caffeine more than negative effects from Modafinil.  Caffeine has a short half life, so you would feel the withdrawal from caffeine before you would feel the benefit of modafinil.  It is also not a 1 to 1 trade off.  So Modafinil (while you are smart to reduce/eliminate caffeine while using it) is not an ""even trade"".  

Caffeine can have a large effect on mood.  If I understand what you said, you did not drink your normal 2-3 cups of coffee, then had 1 around 12:30. 

That's anywhere from 200-450 mg of caffeine you dropped.  If you really drink 8oz cups.  If you are the 12 that most people drink, it would be even more.  

If you have been drinking coffee for a while, your body is used to the caffeine.  

I'd reduce the Modafinil, and taper off of the caffeine.  Maybe go to a firm 2, then down to 1 after a week."	MattDr02	reply	na	na	na	0.9994838237762451	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

For the past 3 years, I have been taking 20 mg of methadone a day, and now I have completely quit morphine and methadone for about two months.
The biggest problems I have now are:
I have never been my true self since I was young, and I still am not, and I am afraid that I have shown my true self, and I have limited myself since I was young, and I still do, and I do not like the character that I created for myself at all, and I am sick of it, and I have no self-confidence.
I hate myself and I know that I must change, but I have been involved in this issue for a long time and I cannot change and be comfortable with myself.
My concentration is very low and my mind is constantly thinking and only negative thoughts flow in my mind, which I have no control over.
I have no motivation and hope to do anything.
I have no passion and taste.
I rarely enjoy the things I should enjoy.
I have no motivation to improve myself.
My body is very weak, but I don't do anything, even though I know I must exercise.
I kind of gave up and suicidal thoughts have always been with me for several years and I really want to die.
I really want to just take drugs sometimes and sleep without being in this world.
Lately, I want to take methadone and clonazepam again and be in the world of self-denial.
But there is still a part of me that wants to get better, but it has become very weak lately.
It's very strange to me that I can't even start a little exercise!
After quitting methadone, the psychiatrist prescribed Escitalopram and Aripiprazole for me, but I have no trust in these doctors and these pills at all, and I think they have very very low effect and have very bad side effects, but I feel so bad that a part of me wants to give up and start taking the pills, but I have a problem, although they must be used for a long period of time, and on the other hand, I would like to try the microdose of magic mushrooms, but if I take these pills, I can't do that anymore.
Even now, because I am taking clonazepam and before that I was taking methadone, I did not start microdosing magic mushrooms.
I have taken SSRI and Nortriptyline before, but they had very little effect and did not make me feel better, it just made it easier for me to live this way.
And I forgot to say that I have been taking Quetiapine 25mg every night for about 4 years.
I used to take a higher dose, but now there is only 25 mg, and I will soon quit this pill, and I don't even know what harmful effects this pill has had on me in the past few years, I know this about clonazepam.
As for mushrooms, my life is divided into two parts: before a high-dose mushroom trip and after that, that trip really changed me and made me improve a lot and become better, but unfortunately, I went down a path I shouldn't have followed for a while, and my condition has gotten worse recently.
Now I can't start anything and it's like my mind is somehow locked that I want to make a series of moves to get better and it's a few years have we been like this.
I thought that I would get better after quitting methadone and started exercising, but I only got worse now and my body weakness is much more visible, which is really annoying.
I welcome any advice and help regarding about quitting clonazepam.
And whether to take Escitalopram and Aripiprazole or not?!!
Whether to try the mushroom microdose when I am also taking clonazepam or not.
I really do not know what to do!
I just want to feel better.
I just wanna exercise, meet new people, have plans for myself, playing my electric guitar again, read books, the improvement of my concentration that I lost, not to thinking all the time and no control on my thoughts and many other things like these stuff."	_shpongled	post	28.299204064852074	male	White	0.9982549548149109	na	na	na	1	depressionregimens
"Escitalopram I found a little too numbing, but I could've backed down on the dose a bit. Aripiprazole helped save my life. That's not to say these are the experiences that you'll have since we all tolerate and react to medications differently.

I don't have any advice about the clonazepam.

I think it would be a good idea to try out the escitalopram and aripiprazole, if they don't work well then you can go off of them (with your doctor's guidance, of course). Aripiprazole was very sedating starting out, so maybe taking it at night would be a good idea. The sedating effects wore off within a week. I personally noticed a difference pretty quickly with aripiprazole, but the escitalopram took much longer.

There's also ketamine or esketamine treatments. Ketamine usually isn't covered by insurance so it can be costly, but there are more affordable options such as oral troches, compounded nasal spray, etc. Esketamine should be covered by insurance, but generally it seems like people prefer regular (racemic) ketamine treatments. /r/therapeuticketamine if you want to read more about it."	_shpongled	reply	na	na	na	0.9982549548149109	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
"Hi everyone. Failed every SSRI known to man, SNRIs throw me into a panic attack, Wellbutrin sucks dick, Buspirone makes me light-headed and stupid, Abilify almost gave me HIV due to sexual impulses, and here I am ready to jump off a bridge. Currently, I'm on a very low dose of everything. I decided to taper off under the direction of my incompetent psychiatrist, who now wants to trial me on Mirtazapine, Flexeril, Trazodone, and a beta-blocker while I taper off Seroquel.

Right now my sleep quality sucks but I tapered off Seroquel and Gabapentin because I was completely impotent at 21 years old with no other contra-indications. My hormones are fucked to hell and back, I could sell my thyroid on Craigslist and notice no loss in TSH functionality, and I'm really stuck in a totally hopeless place where I'm sober but I'm only alive because my parents are alive.

Therapy is cool, but I need to find a good DBT and I'm doubtful that will help but I'm willing to give it a shot.

Current Dosages (morning/noon/night)

\- Seroquel 5, 10, 35 mg. IR each day  
\- Gabapentin 300/300/300  
\- Lithium 300 (considering upping this to 600 because I have undetectable blood levels and it might help w/ suicidal ideation, doctor told me to either increase the dose or get off entirely -- not sure what I wanna do yet)  
\- Levothyroxine 100 mcg. daily

Supplements/Vitamins

\- I work out 4 times a week and cry after most workouts- B-complex, PS-100, Vitamin D 5000 IU (started today)- not sure what else to add for depressive symptoms. they really drag me down to a very dark place. but all my problems can be traced back to unresolved familial trauma. there's nothing left for me to do and i feel hopeless. please give me hope because every time I read through r/depression I want to kill myself even more.

I'm afraid to try new medications because I have dealt with a lot of embarrassment from being impotent (no morning wood, no erections, not looking at porn, not masturbating) for the past 2-3 years. Taking Viagra would send me to urgent care with BP issues instead of giving me an erection, so I had no recourse.

Prolactin levels were elevated and tapering down off these medications has given me my dick back, for the most part. I would rather suffer with my feelings and have a working penis than take something that ""helps"" in one way and destroys my self-esteem in another department. I've also lost a decent amount of weight and my metabolism is back to normal.

I drink way less coffee and consume way, way less nicotine than I used to because I had no energy or ability to concentrate while taking a dose of Seroquel that actually stabilized my emotions. Feeling flat, fat and lethargic is the best that this medication has to offer. Since tapering off I've lost about 40 pounds and I'd like to keep it that way.

I've tried to taper lower on my Seroquel and Gabapentin but I'm met with violent panic attacks, severe insomnia, restless everything syndrome, and pressure headaches after every ""drop"" at these lower doses. Please help me I don't know what to do. Prayer isn't cutting it anymore and natural remedies are like pissing in the wind. I always get blowback on my face."

people on here recommend trying MAOIs and nefazodone. there’s also ketamine and TMS.	Outside-Duck-5984	reply	na	na	na	0.997622549533844	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens
"This is not medical advice, it's just my personal experience. The mirtazapine will probably help with your sleep issues. At lower doses, it's often prescribed to treat insomnia, and it does have a sedating effect (which is why they'll ask you to take it at night). Unfortunately, it can make you fatter. Similar profile as many SSRIs for sexual dysfunction, it won't do you any favors. 

However, I do really like it. I'm on a higher dose now and don't really have many side effects aside from gaining some weight. I feel pretty balanced and I don't have much emotional blunting. I can still cry. Since you're exercising a lot, you might be able to mitigate the weight gain. 

Honestly, after reading through your post, I think you're trying too many things. If I were you, I think I might try to taper off most of the medications, hit a baseline for a couple of weeks, and then try a new one. However, if you're completely non-functional off your meds, this may not be possible, so I would be cautious. It's just that it can be hard to tell what's working when it's in combination with other medications, and the effects of many anti-depressants are subtle at first. I definitely would not do this unless I was working with a good psychiatrist.

Strongly recommend finding a good therapist. Definitely would consider finding a new psychiatrist. Shop around, and definitely interview a couple of people before you pick one. Finding a psychiatrist who also offers ketamine and TMS could be helpful. They're more exotic treatments, but they do definitely work for some people.  You could also consider something super cutting-edge, like psilocybin therapy in Oregon. That's very, very new though, and I believe there's only one clinic that's operating right now."

"It sounds like you would be a good candidate for nefazodone.  Most people don't have sexual side effects with it at all.  It works great on depression and anxiety.  I know so many people who have told me they tried everything else and it was their last option and changed their life.  I have been on it for over 20 years and have no intentions of ever going off of it.  It is the only thing that can keep my anxiety under control.  It is also weight neutral and many people say that when they switch to it they lose weight.  It is probably because the others cause weight gain.  

I am surprised to see a doctor that would put someone on mirtazapine and trazodone at the same time.  Is he trying to sedate you all day.  Another option and it is currently only be done in California, but should reach other parts of the country is a new protocol for TMS called SAINT.  It is supposed to be much more effective and require less treatments.  Next year a new medication called Ruoxinlin (ansofaxine) is up for approval.  It has some similarities to nefazodone.

"I tried the 15 mg. Mirtazapine once with half my normal dose of nightly Seroquel as instructed by my doctor. 

I slept great that night. By the next night from 7-11 PM I was in a full-blown panic attack with heart racing, adrenaline through the roof, all physical symptoms. Since then I’ve just kept the meds she wants to try me on. Haven’t been taking them, I’m at my “baseline” with my current medication regimen as listed in the post. My baseline sucks but adding new shit to the mixture might land me in the ER with anxiety attacks if I’m not careful. I can’t taper off any more or I fear for my safety and sanity.

But, if I take the Mirtazapine with my normal nightly Seroquel dose I’m afraid I’ll be over-sedated and suffer with breathing issues. Stuck between a rock and hard place.

"So, I've had pretty good success looking for therapists on Psychology Today's ""Find a Therapist"" tool. You can filter by specialty, insurance coverage, whether they're accepting new patients, etc. I like to call or email, and briefly explain my issues (in your case, you're looking for someone who can do DBT and would be willing to schedule multiple appointments per week, and has experience with treatment-resistant depression). If they agreed that they could handle those issues, I would book an initial appointment. 

It's a good idea to find 2-3 therapists and schedule initial appointments with all of them. This is a normal thing to do, you can just tell them that you're trying to find a new therapist and will call to schedule a 2nd appointment if you decide to go with them. I would also generate a list of questions to ask them in the first appointment, you're basically trying to figure out if you'll be a good fit. 

Question wise, you can ask whether they like to assign homework, if they would be available on short notice if you needed to schedule an emergency appointment, if they are blunt with patients, do they do virtual appointments,  basically anything you would need to know that would cause you to stop seeing them. Get all your ""No, I couldn't work with a therapist who does this"" questions answered.

I definitely do understand how time-consuming this process is, and I would try to be kind to yourself. It's really hard to meet a stranger and tell them very intimate details about yourself, and risk the hour being a waste. But, finding a good therapist is extremely, extremely helpful.

"Hi. I've been on a lengthy medical journey, trying to find something for anxiety and low energy for two years now. Since then, I have tried a bunch of options and my doc has concluded that I have sensitivity to meds in terms of side effects. We are running out of ideas.   


What I have tried:  
SSRI (paroxetine, escitalopram, sertraline) - the whole class gives me a number of bad side effects  
SNRI (duloxetine) - stopped working after 3 months, higher dose didn't do anything better and the withdrawal was horrible  
Atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole, olanzapine) - after 1.5 months have developed muscle twitches, switching didn't help, only getting off of it kind of did  
Others - mirtazapine (sleeping all the time), bupropion (currently on it, doesn't improve my anxiety though), buspirone (may or may not also trigger twitches, figuring it out right now)  


What I know I haven't tried aka our last option at the moment:  
Lamotrigine  


Not available in my country:  
Often newer meds (2020-23), vortioxetine. 

I am also aware of beta-blockers, but it seems like they only treat certain manifestations of physical anxiety. 

Is there anything left at all?

"hello, I am a psychiatrist that just graduated from residency. Treatment-resistant depression is a favorite topic for me and hope some of this is helpful:  


1. For people with a more anhedonic or melancholic depression, I've had pretty good luck (as in 1 in 2 or 3 of my treatment-resistant patients responding really well) with high-dose pramipexole. While usually used for restless legs syndrome, when you push is to 2-4 mg daily, it is a powerful dopamine agonist. I've had it work well for anhedonia, unipolar, and bipolar depression. The most common side effects my patients tell me about is it can disrupt their sleep at the dosages needed for depression, so most take it in the morning or twice a day. However, sometimes this can make you sleepy so its not tolerable for everyone. I've had this work when many MANY other meds did not work
2. Fixing sleep. I can't tell you how many of my patients have ""treatment-resistant depression"" that end up being diagnosed with sleep apnea after I order a sleep study. I've also had great luck with doing CBT-I with my patients and that helping their depression a lot
3. Make sure (I'm guessing these things have been ruled out already, but just in case) that common-sense deficiencies are ruled out. The most common one in my area of the US is vitamin D deficiency. I'll often have patients come back in a month after taking 50k IU once weekly saying their mood and energy and anhedonia are much improved. Other things I always rule out is thyroid (ordering a TSH), iron panel, and B12/folate. I've also had surpisingly good luck with mangesium supplementation. This one is more nebulous though, as serum magnesium labs generally dont pick up mild to moderate deficiencies given that serum mangesium is highly controlled given that it is an electrolyte and important for heart conduction. A better way to test mag MIGHT be RCB magnesium, but this isn't a validated test at this time. I usually just tell my patients to take mag citrate or carbonate (200-400 mg daily) for 2 weeks and see if it helps. I haven't seen it help depression as much per-se, but it has helped maybe 1 in 3 of my anxious patients with sleep, stress, and restlessness. 
4. This one is harder to address IRL as this is a niche topic, but there has been an explosion of studies showing there is an ""inflammatory"" flavor of depression that can be screened for by ordering a C-reactive protein (CRP). Studies show that if CRP is over 2-3 mg/dL, people tend to respond better to anti-inflammatories like high EPA fish oil, methylfolate, or minocycline, which is a potent microglial inhibitor in the brain
5. The evidence is very strong that both cardiovascular exercise and resistant training have a drug-like effect on depression. There is both an instant mood benefit, but also a more longlasting anti-depressant effect of exercise that kicks in after 2-3 months of consistent exercise. Interestingly for resistance training, the studies show that the antidepressant effect is NOT related to if you become physically stronger. There are also 4 human trials strongly suggesting a plant-focused diet (google SMILES trial) can improve clinical depression as well. For example, in the landmark SMILES trial, those in the diet group had a remission rate of 32%, compared to 8% in the control group
6. MAOIs do indeed appear to work for many people when all others fail. It can be hard to find a psychiatrist that is willing to prescribe it. Surprisingly, there is an online telepsych company that prescribes MAOIs now. A psychiatrist will be more willing to consider an MAOI if you can convince them that you are at low risk of suicide by overdose, and are willing to fill the medication every 7-14 days in the beginning, Doctors are weary of MAOIS due to the risk of overdose, patients not following the dietary restrictions, and, frankly, getting sued.

"oh, and have you looked into TMS or ketamine? Ketamine is generally not covered by insurance, but esketamine, the nasal spray, generally is. And if your depression is really severe or treatment-resistant, you can also look into ECT. ECT, notwithstanding its dramatic portrayal in hollywood, continues to be the most effective treatment ever found for depression. There is no risk of death from ECT beyond the small risk from general anesthesia. Short-term memory loss is a fairly common side effect, but tends to totally resolve within a few weeks. Most people that respond to ECT need 6-12 sessions over 3 to 6 weeks (ie usually twice a week). Reponse rates to ECT are relatively high compared to other meds in treatment-resistant depression- about 70-80%. If one responds to ECT, they can get 1 booster session a month for 6 months to maintain the effect. Some people will get a booster session once every month or every few months long-term. ECT sounds scary to a lot of people (understandably) but is done on about 100k people a year, and often with life-changing effects. It also sometimes ""resets"" a person's brain so they respond to meds they previously didn't respond to or to a med that pooped out on them.

I was reassured in the past that I do not have sleep apnea, though no sleep study was done (kind of difficult to get it around here).

"How does CBT work if the depression is biological and not related to stress? The issue I always have with it is that all my thoughts are related to the depression symptoms itself.

"> Doctors are weary of MAOIs due to the risk of overdose

Where did you get that information from? TCAs, SSRIs, Bupropion and many sleep-aids we commonly prescribe are all much, much more dangerous in overdose. You need close to 100% inhibition of MAO for a robust therapeutic response, it's not like taking extra is going to inhibit your MAO enzymes to death. Hell, rarely people will abuse TCP and take many hundreds of milligrams daily with little ill effect.  

In my experience most doctors are afraid of MAOIs because of rote memorization of information so ancient and flawed it borders on mythos.

**edit:** Don't get me started on the absurd belief that Zofran with an MAOI is in any way dangerous! ... yet, I had 6 questions on my boards implicating Zofran in cases of Serotonin Toxicity. 

> patients not following the dietary restrictions,

The dietary restrictions are laughable. Tyramine does not exist in modern commercially available foods. Even fermented foods. Tyramine is exclusively produced when high-protein organic material is left out to be colonized by wild-type bacteria and yeast that express tyrosine decarboxylase. These early microbes universally produce compounds that are intolerable to humans as well such as cadaverine, and  Putrescine

Widespread use of starter cultures (which don't have these early-type microbes) in both commercial and home kitchens has effectively eliminated the need for restrictions while taking an MAOI."	Shroomyboyo	reply	na	na	na	0.9988129138946533	no	strong	strong	na	depressionregimens

you have a very good point that I actually agree with. Some people have a depressive disorder or standalone anhedonia that is NOT related to cognitive distortions. CBT still has a component that can address mood and anhedonia that is unrelated to negative thoughts: behavioral activation and activity scheduling. Regardless of the cause of anhedonia, behavioral activation has been shown to beef up the functioning of the reward circuitry of the brain. Over a few months, people often start to feel pleasure again. However, if there is an uncoverable cause of the anhedonia, that needs to ideally be addressed as well. As I've said, reviewing medications, chronic, unpredictable stress or trauma, screening for inflammation with a CPR, etc are all things I look for when anhedonia is present.

"Isnt behavioral activation just a fancy way of saying “fake it to make it” ? It seems a bit dissapointing imo for a patient to just be suggested something that even a layman can suggest, and it is pretty difficult in practice to do because of impatience and the lack of reward in general.

I guess thats where medications and the other stuff is needed to speed it up you would say? 

Can exercise still help anhedonia even if its not giving the endorphin boost?

It’s unfortunate that psychiatry still doesn’t have a treatment for anhedonia to this day, and its basically the most debilitating symptom and the symptom that is probably the most negative. 

Anhedonia also is kind of a chronic stressor in itself and can cause obsessive thoughts even in the absence of actual OCD (basically the thought of “when will this go away, what if this is forever” etc). In this case there is no distortion (maybe fortune telling) or if there is it doesnt really help recognizing it because in the moment, it is kind of true and theres no real way to dismiss it while still feeling that way.

"I'm not 100% sure what you mean by ""fake it till you make it"" so I will just describe what behavioral activation is. this is ideally done with a therapist but can be done solo if needed.  
\-you make a list of things you value and used to derive pleasure and meaning from

\-you start scheduling these hobbies or activities. just like a med, you ""start low and go slow."" you slowly ramp up getting back to doing things you used to love

\-it is 100% expected that the first few weeks or months you will NOT derive pleasure and joy from these activities. Just like a med, you need to give your brain time to start ramping up the activity and synaptogenesis or the reward circuitry of your brain, ie the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbnens  


\-if someone responds to BA over a few months, their reward centers in their brain starts lighting up closer to normal/before the anhedonia. This has been shown in 2 or 3 functional MRI studies of depressed/anhedonic humans  


you have to treat BA like you would a drug. You start with what you can manage, and you tolerate continuing feeling numb until you start feeling the joy and pleasure return. Its certainly not guaranteed to 100% cure anhedonia but you would be surprised how effective this can be in helping ameliorate anhedonia in many people.  


I 100% share your disappointment that there are no FDA approved meds specifically for anhedonia. I would be careful not to discount something as simple as BA though. Sometimes the simple things do really work, but of course, not for all.   


I am always scouring the medical literature for anhedonia treatments and share your frustration. Low dose abilify, pramipexole, wellbutrin, ketamine, TMS, BA, addressing underlying causes like chronic stress and poor sleep and inflammation are the best we have to offer currently.  


and there is in fact evidence that exercise improves positive affect, which means it has an anti-anhedonic effect. It doesn't seem to be due to the ""runners high"" or immediate boost in neurotransmitters though. Its something that works over a few months after consistent exercise. Multiple studies, including in parkinson's patients, shows that exercise gradually has a pro dopamine effect, but with increased levels but also upregulation of D2 receptors which are vital to addressing anhedonia.

In all but like 4 states, you can go online and order one yourself. It costs about 30 bucks. If the CRP is over 2 or especially over 3, there is a very good chance it is effecting someone's anhedonia. If this is the case, it opens a wide range of potential treatments a psychiatrist would generally not offer that works for this ""inflammatory flavor"" of depression symptoms or anhedonia, like high-EPA fish oil, minocycline (which directly shuts down inflammation in the brain by inhibiting microglia), methylfolate, and any lifestyle change that reduces inflammation like a mediterranean diet or weight loss."

AKA, if blood CRP is high, you can be rest-assured your brain is inflammed as well.  


The gut connection you mention is interesting. The ""leaky gut hypothesis"" of illness and chronic inflammation is something I tend to believe is almost certainly a thing. The theory goes that an inflammed, leaky gut will allow LPS from gram negative bacteria to leach into the blood, trigger TLR-4, and thus starts a cascade of systemic inflammation. While there isn't direct scientific evidence to back this up just yet, I've had multiple patients tell me that using supplements that have been shown to reduce gut leakiness/intestinal permeability did in fact improve their anhedonia. Supplements that reduce intestinal permeability include glutamine, colostrum, quercetin, NAG, and I think a few others. IMO, it would make sense that dysbiosis or SIBO would improve someone's anhedonia or mood if it is related to inflammation, as dysbiosis or overgrowth definitely increases intestinal permeability, placing one at risk for the LPS translocation I mentioned and the inflammation that follows this.

"Hi everyone,

I hope you all are doing the best possible!

I have a huge problem and would like to know if anyone ever experienced this. 

I am a 34yo woman. Until being 31, I was a happy and motivated person. I only had bad anxiety. GAD, OCD and Panic attacks. I saw many therapists (didn’t really get along with most of them), and all insisted to put me on an antidepressant. I always refused as antidepressants scared me, for some reason, more than benzos that I could take only as needed. But in 2020 I gave up and accepted to take Effexor (Venlafaxine.)

I cannot lie: Effexor worked for some stuff: my panic attacks went from 100 to 10 maybe. I have a bit less of general anxiety (even after stopping it.) I stopped it though, because everyone told me I was like a robot on this med, no emotions, plus everything linked to sex was dead to me. I also gained 24kg despite eating good. So I stopped very slowly, slower than the guidelines even.

Still got a bad withdrawal, I was prepared for it so I pulled through. No brain zaps, but for the first time in my life I felt what depression was, and let me tell you I gained tremendous respect for people living with depression. This is awful. Being bedridden. Not enjoying anything. Taking a shower being like climbing Everest, etc.

Anyway, the withdrawal slowly passed and the depression too. My sex drive and orgasms gradually came back (even though less intense than before), so did my emotions (also less intense than before.) but yeah I was pretty much almost my old self.

Suddenly WHAM! Months and months later, I am hit some little depressive episodes here and there. Not that long so it was ok. And suddenly since one month, I got it with a huge, and I mean really huge, depression blow. I enjoy nothing. Cannot leave my bed. Cannot lose some weight even with dieting. I feel hopeless, I lost my self confidence. Every shower is a victory.

My psych wanted me to try Bupoprion, started 2 days ago, and ooooh the horror. I am writing this on maybe 12mg Xanax to function. The bupoprion didn’t make me anxious, but it made my depression x2. To the point I began to want to die right now (I won’t do it though as I respect my mom and husband too much so no worries.) 
So no more Bupoprion, I know we should hang in there for weeks before results but this is way too intense, a few more days like this and I could be dead.

But back to my main point and question: yes I have an anxious terrain, but before taking Effexor I can promise I never, never had depression! Sure I had some sad moments, got lovesick etc… but not this awfulness that is destroying my brain now. I cannot help thinking the Effexor is at fault for it. It changed my brain enough for me to have no more panic attacks, so maybe it changed it enough too for me to now be a new MDD client?

Has anyone experienced anything like this? I am very curious and would like maybe some hope. I don’t understand what happened to my brain since Effexor. I am not my cheerful, confident me anymore. It’s been around one year I stopped it now. What has it done to me?!

Thank you for any insights or just kind words. I couldn’t be typing here without the Xanax. I cannot get up from my bed. What happen to my pre-Effexor me? I’ve read a study made on monkey showing giving antidepressants to monkeys with no pre-existing depression has adverse effects and actually touched their brain areas linked to depression. However, this study is fairly new and unique. So I guess we’ll have more answers in 10 or so years.

Thank you for everyone who did read me.

TD ; LR: was a happy but anxious woman until I was 31. Got prescribed Effexor for anxiety. Got to know depression for 1st time in my life during withdrawals but withdrawal is over since almost a year. However, I have now bouts of depression coming back and forth and especially now a long one since 1 month that is REALLY bad. Almost cannot get up and have no feeling. Does anyone else feel like an antidepressant given for another cause than depression messed up their brain?

No, but I’ve heard of that happening. SSRI/SNRI withdrawal can be severe and long lasting. Some people will go on it for depression and then after they go off of it they now have anxiety that they’ve never had before.	laeti88	reply	na	na	na	0.9978262782096863	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"100% possible. This is unfortunately not recognized by the medical community.

"When I was 15 I had my first episode of depression. They didn't give me medications back then because they said I was too young. Anyway, I saw a psychiatrist and it kind of went away by itself, I would even say that therapy had nothing to do with my remission. Time simply did its thing.

I didn't just have depression. I also had OCD and severe social anxiety. Those never went away. At some point I started taking medication for those, and they became much more tolerable.

However, I developed quite severe anhedonia, which wasn't present before and wasn't even prominent during my first episode of depression. No enjoyment out of anything. Everything is boring. Lost all interest. Don't even enjoy listening to music anymore. At some point I had suicidal thoughts too but it got better since. Antidepressants reduce all emotions, including the positive ones like joy and pleasure.

Note that this is WHILE taking an antidepressant, not during withdrawal. As for you, I'm not really sure that effexor is the cause of your problems. It's sad to say, but anxiety and depression seem to go hand in hand, when you get one you're predisposed to get the other one too, they probably share a common pathophysiology. So it could be that you would have gotten depression regardless of your previous use of effexor. I don't think anyone can tell, honestly, and obsessing over it is not productive."	laeti88	reply	na	na	na	0.9978262782096863	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"My gynecologist prescribed me klonopin for sleep issues. I never had depression before that. I took that almost every night for a year and only quit bc friends would tell me they could tell I was super irritable every day after 5pm. After I quit taking it I became depressed. 

I’ve taken zoloft and Wellbutrin for extended periods. The Wellbutrin worked great for me and after 2-3 year on it I stupidly went off. When I tried to restart it 9 months later I was extremely suicidal within 5 days so a similar situation to what you experienced. It was very scary.

When I was 16 I was prescribed Zoloft for social + generalized anxiety disorder, the psychiatrist told me I also had depression and that it would help with that too (even though I had never felt depressed, only anxious). I was on it for maybe 2 months then stopped due to side effects and ever since then I now actually suffer from depression. I’m now 20 and still have to take antidepressants to feel “okay” mood wise.

"hello, shrink here. This is sadly a real thing for a small unlucky percentage of people. Its called ""tardive dysphoria."" Its a controversial, relatively unknown phenomenon (for example, every collegue I've talked to about this looked at me with a blank stare). There is not much evidence about what to do about this but some researchers hypothesize that having a long period WITHOUT an antidepressant might allow the brain to return to homeostasis. The idea is that chronic antidepressant use might desensitize certain serotonin receptors in a way that is pro-depressant for those predisposed to this phenomenon. It might be reversible with sustained abstinence from the drug that potentially caused this in the first place.

"Thank you so much for your reply! :) So basically my case could be the reverse of the one you mention (I got on Effexor for anxiety but now lost anxiety but gained depression instead)?  I totally believe you and I think it’s really possible, but it feels so odd. Why was I feeling like it was over with the withdrawal for months and then this depression came back randomly resembling withdrawal number 2? It just arrived on a random day, months after, yeah that wasn’t an amazing day but not that awful neither. Since then I’m stuck in it. Maybe, have you heard how long can this type of thing last (for the example you mentioned involving the reverse scenario depression/anxiety)? I am lost and I don’t know what I should do. I don’t want to go back to a SSRI/SNRI seeing what it did to me on the long term after stopping it, I know it would give me some relief probably but this terrifies me. It feels like I am not myself anymore. Do you think I should just pull through it and accept now this depressive episode will probably pass and is part of a very long withdrawal process?

Thank you for your reply! After reading some studies, I am actually thinking like you. How come so many doctors don’t recognize it? Is it by will or because of the pharmaceutical company pressure? I don’t get it. I just know every therapist I saw so far pressured me for antidepressants against my anxiety. I always refused. I refused for 6 years or so before giving up. I should have listened to my inner voices. Having less panic attack is not worth not being able to get up from my bed, having anhedonia almost every day, gaining unhealthy weight. Right now I am just a mass in a old pajama laying on my bed hoping Xanax gives me strenght to shower tonight, before Effexor I was passionate by books, documentaries, learning more about things, I had a right BMI with a “perfect” weight, enjoyed swimming etc. I was always saying hello to my husband happily, cooked etc. All of this is gone. I am just a mass on a bed in a pajama I didn’t manage to change since yesterday, couldn’t get up to say hello to my husband even, made my mom cry. I go to Japan to visit my in-laws in 15 days and feel nothing about it. Japan is my fav country though. I don’t know what Effexor did to my brain but it’s nasty. As you said, I think it is prescribed like candy for anyone. Should be reserved for people with REAL severe MDD who couldn’t function without it. On the other side, doctors refuse to prescribe me some medications that actually helped me (I also have a chronic autoimmune illness and a loooong history of bad diagnosis by doctors. Honestly my trust is gone at this point.) Sorry to sound like this, I am usually a positive person but I am angry at what this thing made (90% sure) to my brain.

"Thank you for your answer! I am sorry you have been suffering from so many issues. I am happy your suicidal thoughts are better and I hope your anhedonia too? I have this too right now and it’s despicable. To be honest, I am not obsessing over it but curious. I still think the Effexor has something to do with this(but I could be totally wrong!). I just find it too odd that suddenly after 34yo without NO dépression sign at all, I have a random MDD episode months after stopping Effexor, feeling exactly like Effexor withdrawal. But as you said, we will never know for sure as science doesn’t  have ways to check this for now. Another comment mentioned people developing new anxiety after antidepressant withdrawal, anxiety they never had before. We have yet so much to discover when it comes to neurosciences, as my therapist says! He is a neuroscience nerd since a teen (he is in his 80’s now) and admits he knows nothing about the actual mechanisms of antidepressants. Now my main worry is, should I just keep pulling through this awful episode thinking it might be a long withdrawal effect from
Effexor? Or should I try to help myself? I don’t know how though, as I know help would mean antidepressants again and tbh now I am terrified of them.

Are you taking something now? Zoloft or Wellbutrin or else? Honestly, antidepressants terrify me way more than benzo. But it might maybe be possible that a benzo like Klonopin did something to you, after all our brains are all so different.

"Hello, and thank you so much for your extremely interesting reply! Oh my, how I wish there was a psych. near me who were like you and knew of this condition… that would be golden. Mine is like your colleagues, totally unaware of its existence. My psychiatrist also didn’t believe Effexor gave me total anorgasmia, he knew about the lack of libido possibility but didn’t acknowledge the fact it could totally cut out orgasms and especially alter them even after stopping it too.

I SO wish it is true and that brain could go back to homeostasis without antidepressants for a long time. The fact a few researches showed this gives me a glimmer of hope, thank you.
If i may, could I ask your opinion? For a time after Effexor, I think I made a mistake of my own: as you maybe read in some other comments, I used to be on Oxycodone for a very bad chronic pain issue. Unfortunately my GP decided to stop it suddenly because she got scared of it (I was using it reasonably though, but here as everywhere I guess opiates are gaining more and more of a bad rep), so I was put on Tramadol instead. Didn’t have any withdrawal from the oxy which I stopped cold turkey. Tramadol didn’t really work for my pain but to top this, I think I might have disturbed my brain more than it was already after Effexor (since as you probably know, Tramadol is synthized by a lot of people as a SNRI and a weak opiate.) Do you think Tramadol could have triggered these worsening relapses? I already had some before the Tramadol episodes, but none like the current one.

In a few weeks Zuranolone may be approved. Its possible that this will be one potential solution so theres some hope.

I’m now taking Trintellix 5 mg, it’s definitely been keeping me from having any more severe depressive episodes where I just wanna lay in bed all day. I did do 2 rounds of TMS to come this far though, once in late 2021 and the second time this past March, 86 sessions in total and that I feel removed those feelings of sadness, melancholy, grief, you know the typical negative feelings that come with depression, but it didn’t help with the apathy and wanting to do things + the anxiety which is why I’m on Trintellix and Klonopin. It’s just frustrating how one antidepressant, in my case was Zoloft, triggered actual depression for me that i didn’t have before and now I have to medicate, do things like TMS, I was also doing neurofeedback therapy at one point, just to keep the depression away.	laeti88	reply	na	na	na	0.9978262782096863	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

WOW about Zuranulone, what a coincidence, I was actually reading about it yesterday, searching desperately for new molecules!! This seems indeed promising and interesting. Unfortunately I don’t live in the US but in Switzerland and Swissmedic (the FDA equivalent) is extremely slow and severe in its process to accept or no molecules. Buspirone, for example, is not accepted here as well as many other atypical antidepressants that exist elsewhere.

Xanax only helps me now that I am in my Bupoprion awfulness phase. Since I plan to stop Bupoprion tomorrow, I also plan to lower Xanax drastically. It is usually only a good sleep help. Lyrica helps my mood a bit but I feel I am dependant on it (despite all these studies saying it is not addictive…) actually forgot to take Lyrica for a few days a year ago or so, I spent 2 days emptying my guts with the worst anxiety possible. It stopped once I took Lyrica. I cannot make a 100% sure like though…

TBH, I know it’s now well seen today but the only med that really helped my anhedonia since stopping Effexor, my anxiety and gave me my old self back was Oxycodone. I got it prescribed because I have a very bad chronic pain condition. I used it for 2 years without issue, no overdose or anything. Unfortunately, the doc who prescribed it to me got scared suddenly and stopped the prescription. I stopped it cold Turkey and had no withdrawal symptoms.

My body is odd, one of my doc btw advised me to take a blood test to check my enzymes to understand better why I don’t get withdrawals from high doses of Xanax or Oxycodone. The only bad withdrawal I had (and maybe still have) is and was from Effexor (and maybe Lyrica but unsure, to check.)

"Oh, actually my therapist also suggested a gene enzyme study for me, as I have odd reactions/withdrawals to meds.

I honestly never experienced anhedonia before taking Effexor. On the opposite, I was labelles as ultra sensitive: the type to cry seeing a sunset or listening to a beautiful song, etc. I was enjoying life and activities. When I learnt what anhedonia was like after stopping Effexor and now (which is 90% think is still at Effexor’s fault), I honestly gained so much respect for people who have anhedonia coming without having take a medication for it. This feels awful. I know I should be enjoying what I am doing, but I just feel nothing. Cannot enjoy nothing. I am happy Effexor is helping you, honestly. If you had anhedonia before it, then it is a great choice I think that you did. I don’t think all ssri/SNRI are useless, as you said yourself.

My GP is awesome with both mental health and women's health and he felt bad I ended up with a MDD that might have not happened if we had gotten on top of the HRT sooner. 

I am very fortunate to have a supportive extended family and friend group who understood that I wasn't well,  but encouraged me to keep connecting and participating. 

So for several months I played a team sport without any enjoyment but because I knew in my head my teammates appreciated I was there (I play a particular position that few people find comfortable).  

I also picked up an ultra-basic craft project and made it for someone specific knowing it would give her a lot of joy to receive it. 

I meditated,  journaled and did a lot of parasympathetic boosting activities, reminding myself that even if I could not feel anything I could still work on healing. 

With food Effexor is only very slightly weight positive for me and only over 150mg.  Because of a previous MDD where I lost 12kg in 12 weeks,  this time I ate a very carefully planned diet even if I didn't enjoy it. 

Later on I learned my accidental approach is one of the few things recognised for anhedonia from a therapeutic perspective. All those actions I had no expectation of former skill or enjoyment but instead took comfort from knowing what I was doing had value to others. 

I'm about 3 months post the end of my anhedonia (which disappeared quite fast when it actually stopped) and really enjoying my personal and professional life. 

You mentioned things never getting fully back to normal.  With hindsight I realised my first treated MDD happened before I was 25 and if I understand correctly many aspects of our personality finally consolidate around 25 years,  so I think some  of my changes were that,  not meds related."	laeti88	reply	na	na	na	0.9978262782096863	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"Wow, you are so lucky to have a doctor who both cares well for mental issues AND woman's health at the same time! Seems like you found a real treasure there. I unfortunately have no doctor competent, in each of these fields. I've been struggling for finding doctors last years for my auto immune disease (ankylosing spondyloarthitis most likely) that I almost became allergic to medical appointments and honestly my trust in doctors went totally down. I wish I could meet one that could change my mind. Hopefully, when I finally pull out of this MDD phase I will have enough energy and courage to keep searching.

I am happy you found ways to feel better, and that your anhedonia feels better! I miss not having it.  I didn't have it for 31 years so for me it feels so odd and awful, this lack of feelings or enjoyment doing what I love.

My anxiety started when I was a kid, I was always anxious. Then it aggravated around 25 (like you for your MDD!) I had panic attacks, mild OCD and was just an anxious person overall. However, i managed to get through life with benzos as needed and I was always cheerful, happy and overly sensitive (to positive stimuli.) I only experienced MDD first after Effexor (as I already mentioned, sorry for repeating lol) and I was like: 'wow. so this is what depression is.' I honestly never imagined something so torturing could happen to your brain. As I said in another comment (sorry again if I am repeating myself, am a bit lost ATM), my anxiety was bad but MDD makes my previous lifelong anxiety feel like it was a warm bath.

Thank you so much. I am taking benzos and Pregabalin... today I stopped the Wellbutrin and have been WAY better than yesterday. However, I also took some Phenibut (a Pregabalin cousin, if you ever heard of it), which could have make me feel better. Unfortunately both my psych and family doc are not reliable. When I have enough strenght, I really have to begin to search for new ones (it's also hard at the moment as I am in the middle of an administrative procedure that basically prevents me from ''officially'' changing doctors. It's because of an invalidity insurance thing triggered by my bad chronic pain.) Thank you so much for your kind words.

 She is very doctor allergic as for many years she was ""just fat"".  We met through my professional work and I was one of the first people to listen very carefully and pointed out for her the symptoms of two different auto immune conditions she had that we're not even on the radar.

Good job on you for pointing out the symptoms of your friend's illness! And I have so much compassion for her. Honestly, I have this diagnosis but it's not even sure. I saw 5 different rheums., got 4 different diagnosis. All that is sure is that I have very very bad arthritis in both my lower back and knee (despite not being overweight before Effexor), and my sacro-illiac joint is basically messed up. May I ask if you know what your friend is taking? I have been injecting myself with Humira since 1 year but without improvement. I also got random weird issues like skin ulcers on my leg and stomach ulcers, with no explanations. The docs saying your friend she was ''just fat'' made me think of 2 days ago btw, I went to get a knee infiltration (cannot walk without one of these every few months) and the doc said first line: ''your arthritis is probably due to your weight'' without even knowing anything about me.

Please keep hanging in there. May I ask what exactly are you taking now, if you don't mind?

Edit: sorry if it’s going to sound like I am whining… but it is just really hard and I needed to vent somewhere. Today I managed to cry and let my feelings out thanks to phenibut as I said earlier.

I am jealous .5 of Klonopin working for you! I needed up to 18mg back then to get an effect! I have an odd body and have high tolerance to stuff. May I ask if maybe upping the Klonopin more could help you get more sleep? I know benzos are not the answer but sometimes they can be saviors when we are desperate. If not, then I understand you if you cannot stand Parnate anymore. Do you have a 2nd plan in case you decide to stop it? I am really sorry to hear about your crying spells and ups and downs.

How well did it work for you and at what daily dosage? Also, did it have any withdrawals and how would you compare the withdrawals to SSRI’s and other meds?	RichAf26	post	33.80739527675166	male	White	0.0018510830122977495	na	na	na	13	depressionregimens
"It works better for my anxiety and panic disorder than any other medication I have ever tried. I use 300mg each night for sleep, plus another 300mg during the day if needed for heightened stress, social anxiety, etc. So pretty low doses, but for me the stuff is like magic. It has drastically improved my quality of life, my ability to socialize, and my ability to travel.

I will say that over time, if you take it fairly regularly, you will lose that super obvious, loopy/drowsy feeling that you get when you first start taking it. I think some people interpret that as the medication ceasing to ‘work’ and thus feel a need to increase the dosage, but I don’t see it that way personally. I’ve never increased my dosage even though I don’t really feel those acute effects anymore, and it still works great for actual anxiety relief and the prevention of panic attacks. It’s also the most effective medication I have ever encountered at allowing me to stay asleep during the night, and again, that effect has never diminished even with frequent use.

As for withdrawal, at this dose there really is none. I’ve randomly gone several days without taking any, and aside from reverting to my ordinary, poorer-quality sleep, there are no noticeable effects at all. 

It’s truly unfortunate that gabapentin is not prescribed more for anxiety treatment. In my case it is not only more effective than SSRIs, but it also does not come with the same sexual and anhedonic side effects. People will respond differently and I don’t doubt that in some cases SSRIs are more effective as an anxiety treatment, but I think a lot of people could benefit from gabapentin who probably are not even aware of it.

The largest downside to me is the fact that there is some association between gabapentin and heightened risk of osteoporosis. It’s all about costs and benefits of course, and I believe that everyone should weigh those factors for themselves, but it is something to be aware of."

Keep in mind that I have had the best luck with gabapentin at medium to HIGH dosages. As in  at least 600 x3/day or up to 1,200 3x/day.

You hold it for one second and then breathe out your nose for four seconds. It’s considered a cooling breath and can help calm you down.

One is that they are onto some rare and relatively unknown truth that they are fortunate to know and the rest of the profession is missing out on (unlikely).

"While I understand your experience tells you otherwise, it’s important to remember everyone has a different makeup & response to substances.
I, too, used fentanyl. IV user, concurrent with xanax, multiple (5-6) bars a day on average, for over a year. A decade of heavy (250 mg+ a day) oxycodone habit. But I’ve experienced most of them— amphetamines & alcohol & nicotine & truly— all the weird, obscure shit too like bath salts (specifically MDVP & methicathinone) for various stretches of time; all daily use. 
I say this to tell you I have experienced the unique hell of many, many withdrawals & to me, it’s a bit silly comparing apples to oranges, however I will say without question the worst physical & psychological withdrawals I have ever experienced have come from a drug I was given upon getting sober & that drug is gabapentin. 
In 2017 I was placed on 3,600 mg a day, often taking more than that. 
I tried quitting it repeatedly, but I’d get many of the same benzo/alcohol gabaagonist-type withdrawal symptoms but with far more seizures, hallucinations, self harm (I cut my knee open with an exacto knife because I believed it had “too much fluid in it”) 
When I finally did quit, it took 23 days before I slept. I had been hospitalized twice. I had lost my hearing (the doctors still don’t know or understand why— but for over a week I went entirely deaf) 
All I’m saying is, people aren’t “wrong” for not answering benzodiazepines. 
People have very different reactions to substances & very different exposure & experiences with substances & to try and give some answer to a question like this is a genuinely serious, measured way is silly IMO & a little devaluing to others who have had different experiences.
All withdrawals are shit. Yes, gaba-energic substances like benzodiazepines, alcohol, and gabapentin & lyrica are typically the only only drugs that can directly kill you through withdrawal, it really does vary so much on a person to person basis that to claim one answer is “right” conclusively is reductive."

"Gabapentin works on the gaba receptors in the brain, as do benzodiazepines like Xanax and valium, and as does alcohol. Gaba is the calming neurotransmitter in the brain. 
Gabapentin alters the brain’s levels of gaba in a different/less direct way than benzos or booze. Gabapentin is a calcium channel blocker and I think where the person who told you SSRI got that from was that, in a way, gabapentin is a reputable inhibitor (the RI of SSRI) 
What that means is: there’s 2 ways to increase the levels of something in your brain. Your brain can either pump more of that chemical out (this is called agonism) or it can slow/inhibit the rate at which that chemical is cleared out of your brain, leaving a higher amount floating around. 
Gabapentin keeps more gaba in your brain by impacting the mechanism that removes it.
Benzos or booze are gaba agonists and they pump more gaba out. 
This is why they say not to drink while on gabapentin— your brain is creating more gaba thru the alcohol’s agonism & at the same time removing less of it due to the gabapentin; so it’s a double whammy.
But my point in saying all of this is to tell you that while gabapentin has been championed the last 8 years for off-label use in the treatment of addiction due to this supposed lack of dependency-causing effect, my personal experience is that gabapentin is intensely challenging to get off of (dose & time on it depending) because, although it has a long half life & takes a long time to get out of your system (aka a long withdrawal) the cognitive effects it creates are incredibly short-acting for those taking it for anxiety or opioid withdrawal pain. Most people are given doses 3 or 4 times a day and that’s due to the short duration of its effects. Shorter acting substances are more dependency liable. It’s why crack cocaine is even more addictive than powder cocaine— the effect is packed into a shorter amount of time & therefore stronger & because it’s brief, people will need to do it again & again. And each time you take something you reinforce the behavior & build tolerance.
So I found myself in a spot where I needed to take it 4 times a day, the highest dose, and when I tried to quit the acute, most intense & awful stage of the withdrawal just kept dragging on due to the long half life. 
So to me, it had the addictive quality of something like xanax mixed with the extended withdrawal of something like methadone. 
I had seizures like I’ve never experienced coming off of benzos. I was hospitalized twice— I had heart arrhythmias & for a week I went deaf. The doctors still don’t know why, but it was the scariest week of my life because I thought I was going to be deaf forever. 
But my hearing came back, and although it would take another 2 weeks for the acute withdrawal to subside it finally did.
In my experience it is the hardest substance I have ever quit, and I was an IV fentanyl & oxy & xanax addict for a decade. 
Granted, I was on a dose that they no longer allow (they realized people WERE dependent on it, contrary to their claims, but they don’t tell people that still because it’s one of the top prescribed drugs in the country.

Having tried lots of different antidepressants in an effort to find one that works for me and doesn’t cause tons of side effects, I’d strongly recommend against taking any benzos during start-up. You need to know how your body will actually respond to an SSRI or SNRI. If you’re dampening it with a benzo you won’t know if there are side effects (which can actually include anxiety, and which may persist after you stop the benzo). If you need a benzo during start-up, I’d recommend trying a different medication instead.

Yeah I'm doing a pretty aggressive cross taper between Trintellix and Lexapro. Probably a little too aggressive but I'd rather take the pain up front! I've had one mini panic attack so far and can sense a couple more could be on the way. I get the hate against benzos and know they can be addicting but.... personally for short term use during the often rocky period of adjusting to an SSRI I've found them to be invaluable.	danielrosehill	follow-up	na	na	na	0.976581871509552	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"You need to focus on helping yourself and nothing else for the near future. As another commenter said, you need professional help. A few suck, but they ARE there to help; people do come out of what you're experiencing - myself included.

And you keep trying different medications, therapists until one works ""good enough"" or clicks - or perhaps you feel a sort of uncomfortable ""knot"" in your brain being triggered in their therapy (but give them a fair shot). That's a sign of deeper dysfunction. Sometimes it's mostly how we're made physiologically; sometimes it's something emotional, traumatic, or a toxic environment preventing us from being who we are or what we need. It will take time to unwind.

Do not stop healthy physical routines or diet. Routines may need to be broken or altered at some point, but routines can also be a necessary liferaft while we float to safety. Yet if school or work only worsen your condition, it's often wise to take a medical LOA.

If certain friends and family are helpful, and good to you, especially when you tell them your struggles, keep them around: all others can go in the closet or out the window.

And don't compare yourself to others; but again know others have hurt or felt numb like you, and have come out of the black hole, whole and even happy at times."	makeitfake102	reply	na	na	na	0.9988355040550232	weak	no	no	na	depressionregimens

Mirtazapine has quite an unusual pharmacological profile. It’s more sedating at lower doses and more stimulating at higher doses. So you could try increasing the dose to 30-45 mg.

"Hi everyone, I wanted to share my unusual story of finding the right medication, as well as bring some awareness to a drug that is not FDA-approved. This atypical antipsychotic has only been mentioned in passing on this sub, but I am not a functional human being without it. 

My depression set in when I was a teenager growing up in Moscow. My parents aren’t particularly warm and empathetic, so I spent a couple years self-medicating with random stuff and perusing online forums, until it got bad enough that I pleaded for a psychiatrist. We went to a nice, expensive, older one, recommended by a friend. She actually spent an hour talking to me, which I now recognise as a huge luxury - too many appointments last 15 minutes… I was diagnosed with atypical depression and sent home with a script for 25 mg Zoloft, coupled with 0.25 mg Fluanxol - a very low dose of both. 

Within 3 days, I returned to normalcy! Magically, cognitive distortions dissipated, energy levels returned to an acceptable level, and the cloud of numbness had been lifted. The doctor went on to prescribe me a corrector for some restlessness I had felt in my throat. I took those pills for a year, and then enjoyed another year off them without depression. 

After that, I moved to the United States for college. Alone in a foreign, high-stakes environment, depression returned within the first few days. I went to the medical center to discover that US doctors did not know about flupentixol, and it was not approved for use. I accepted a script for just Zoloft. It did not help, so my dose was upped, which made me worse, and again, which made me enter a zombie-like state. After that, we added on Wellbutrin, which did nothing, and then Abilify to mimic the effect of Fluanxol. That changed my personality and made me unable to eat, but I still couldn’t get out of bed. 

After that, I had tried most SSRIs, Effexor, Risperidone, Quetiapine, Trintellix, shrooms and ketamine, to no avail. The only things that lifted my spirits temporarily were Adderall and Vyvanse for my ADHD, but the effect wore off within the day, and the day after was worse. I barely hobbled through college, heavily self-medicating with weed and relying on short bursts of stimulant energy. The only regimen that broke my catatonic depressive spells was the combination of Zoloft and Flupentixol. 

I have now resorted to stockpiling it while at home (thank god for a different pharmacy system), my current stash will last me the next two years. Hopefully, Russia isn’t reduced to an atomic pile of rubble by then, and the Danish manufacturer Lundbeck continues making it. Without it, life is too painful. It blows my mind that if I spawned in the US, I would be diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression and wouldn’t have even those brief moments of relief when I’m adequately medicated.

So yes, if you struggle with a particular kind of depression that feels physical, is marked moreso by low energy and indifference than sadness, and also have ADHD/autism, you might have a dopamine metabolism problem like me and could benefit from trying this in combination with an SSRI. It seems to be available in Europe and some other places. I would appreciate any input from both people who take it and experts that lurk here, especially theories about why it works and what exactly is wrong in my brain. And of course, US analogs. If you were ever in a situation where you had to source your meds from a different country, I would love to hear about that too. 

Peace, love, Slava Ukraini ✌️"	No-Science-7486	post	33.938198037131734	female	White	0.003952732775360346	na	na	na	17	depressionregimens

Yes, I started taking it a while ago and I am currently trying to increase the dosage.

"When I started Wellbutrin I had no idea side effects could be so bad. It was a nightmare, I was so dizzy, nauseous, anxiety ridden. You name it I went through it. I’m not really suffering from side effects currently though I will say I get anxious very easily but more so physically not mentally. So I feel like my body is dying cause my mind thinks everything’s fine but my heart is racing and I feel like I’m suffocating. East fix though, I started taking propranolol when needed. 

My current issue is that everything makes me cry. Not necessarily only when I’m sad but when I feel any strong emotion i immediately get teary. Like something mildly funny has me tearing from laughing, if I’m super happy I feel like crying. It’s not necessarily something that is worrying me or anything.

"Look,  you have had 3+ years of significant life disruption with the pandemic and are living in an economy that is brutal on most people

1) living at home is better than living in a shit hole with other people who also can't afford to live there.  Be grateful for a family who lets you stay but also look and see if you can take on more responsibility to share the work in running the household. I will bet your parent(s) will appreciate it. 

2) Any job is better than none.  Take pride in what you do and be the best server you can be.  Can you work to be promoted to supervising other servers?  

3) Studying while working is tough.  Celebrate getting through. Stop believing there will be a magic ""I love this"" moment.  Choose subjects that teach transferable skills. 

I own my own business,  the clinical skills I sell are ""easy"" for me.  The tough bit is all the other bits of running a business.  If I knew I'd be here when I was younger is have done more accounting,  management and planning papers. 

4) You don't know what you want to do.  This was the biggest BS sold to your generation.  You don't have to work in your passion. Just work towards doing something you don't hate and let you look after your needs. 

My partner was competent at math,  he qualified as a statistician.  He worked in jobs he didn't hate, until he did hate the bullying and politics BS.  Now he works as a night porter.  Is that wrong?  Other people keep trying to get him back into statistics. If he finds something he wants to do in that field,  all good.  If not,  I'm glad he's got work that gives him satisfaction. 

I've lived with depression and anxiety most of my life.  If I had compared myself to what I see now on social media I would have been way worse. I'm so grateful I didn't have to.  Thing is so much BS is found on social media and there is little room for gratitude for the small daily good things."

im not interested in trying trazadone for sleep as it’s not recommended by national institutes of sleep to be used as a sleeping aid. as well as i don’t react well to ssris/snris and i know trazadone has a light ssri effect and i’d rather just not with any of those drugs after the experiences i’ve had. 

i’m also looking into lyrica for anxiety, i used to use gabapentin but i felt like the effects diminished within a week or two of whatever dose i started and i had to keep going up. i’m moving back in with my bpd abusive mom in a week and my anxiety has been at an 12/10 basically and i was wondering if pregaballin might be something that’ll help me get though even just the first couple weeks or so."

"There are no reliable sleep aids that you could keep long-term without some of the side effects you're trying to avoid, at least that I know of.

Z-drugs and benzos are mostly terribly addictive and quickly backfire, though some newer recommendations favour some z-drugs like eszopiclone. No experience with it, so couldn't say.

Anti-histamine sedatives (such as trazodone, mirtazapine, tricyclics and so on) all carry the side effect of weight gain.

The best bet would be controlling your anxiety, as that seems to be what's keeping you up - it's not what we'd call ""primary insomnia"" but rather a consequence of the anxiety (I say that without knowing your full case ofc, but it's the impression I get).

It doesn’t land like some super strong anti-histamine., I don’t have to take it every night to get sleep. I genuinely fall asleep often with out taking it. there’s no withdrawal that I feel or have heard anyone complain about. I don’t know who the national institutes of sleep are but sounds like you what to follow their advice so what do they recommend ? Which medications do they say to use. 

Bro all I am saying is you asked and people showed up for you and they listed off just about everything that typically works for anxiety, depression, insomnia. Unless I’m miss reading something it seems like you respond with a “no” and you have never tried it and never will because this is going happen or not happen. 

With all due respect and Keeping it 💯I’d stay away from that Lyrica stuff. Ive take gabapentin and your right about how quick the tolerance grows and the weight gain but I believe Lyrica is worse . Plus Your messing with a med that is given out for its painkilling abilities . Like painkilling  or the numbing of pain via your nerves is of course going to take the edge off anxiety. 

Depression , insomnia and anxiety are no joke and  a constant struggle in life. Simply brushing off all the suggestions many of which are very common and  to end up with special k and Lyrica as the way honestly just triggered my anxiety. 

Hopefully this post doesn’t come off too harsh towards you man. Good luck and I hope you find something that works for you"	MattDr02	reply	na	na	na	0.9980633854866028	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
"I just recently asked my psychiatrist about pregabalin, and he said that depression with suicidality is a very common side effect!

As you are interested in ketamine, I strongly suggest you try DXM/DM  (Dextromethorphan bromide). It is Available OTC as a cough medicine, but chemically it is almost the same as ketamine. I have been taking it twice daily at 60 mg for over a year now, and it has really helped with sleep, depression, and anxiety. 

Johns Hopkins is running a clinical trial right now on 60 mg of DXM per day for depression. This is half the dose that is recommended for taking DXM over the counter to treat coughing. DXM has a very good safety profile.

I have been unable to find DXM pills without a hefty dose of guaifenesin in them, but it doesn’t seem to have done me any harm. Also, my psychiatrist isn’t concerned about it. Guaifenesin is used in veterinary medicine as a muscle relaxant/anesthetic, so it might be good for anxiety and sleep. 

Like you, I have had problems with drugs that worked initially, but then very quickly stopped working. Both were muscle relaxants: tizanidine and baclofen. 

I suspect that this may be because of a gene I have for liver enzyme CYP 450 2D6. I am an “ultra rapid metabolizer” for this pathway, which means that if you take a drug which is mainly broken down in the body, by this pathway, then you need to take a high dose, and rarely get serious side effects, because your body is so good at breaking it down. 

It is pretty easy to look up which drugs are metabolized by CYP450 2D6. “Substrate” is the term that pharmacists use to mean a drug or other chemical, which is metabolized by a particular enzyme pathway, so use that as a search term along with 2D6.

This gene is suspected to have a link to depression and suicidality by means of breaking down the body’s own dopamine too quickly. 

As a sidenote, I’ve very recently started taking Abilify/aripiprazole for my TRD, and it is working amazingly well so far with almost no side effects. It’s even helped with my ADHD-like cognitive symptoms, better than any drug I’ve tried before, except maybe bupropion."	MattDr02	reply	na	na	na	0.9980633854866028	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"Seroquel has what is very scientifically called a ""kiss and run"" mechanism of action on dopamine receptors. As a result it has an exceedingly low risk of causing movement disorders compared to other antipsychotic medications.

Seroquel treats most of the issues you've listed. If you want to try it or not is your choice, but it works for depression, generalised anxiety, insomnia, and OCD. I would definitely recommend trying it at a dose of 150mg of the extended release formula to see how you go. It barely tickles dopamine receptors at doses below 300mg, so don't worry yourself with the rare side effects associated with blocking dopamine receptors."

"That's smart of you to consider that. Benzos have never been a win for me. The least trouble I've had with them has been the lowest possible dose of Librium, quite possibly the weakest benzo. Klonopin ruins my life, fast.

Be careful with pregabalin, it doesn't seem to bring on psychological addiction issues, but it's definitely got some nasty withdrawal I've read. But for some it seems to work great.

Look into clonidine, it's been great for me when I can't sleep and my mind is running in circles. You don't have to worry about withdrawal unless you're taking it for a while, and even then it's a much easier taper. It's not ""fun"" either like some benzos.

They are a very big deal. I say this as someone who's gotten off of opioids. That was a piece of cake compared to benzos.

The thing far too many people don't seem to understand about benzos is that they make anxiety worse over the long term (by diminishing the number of GABA receptors). So people end up taking benzos just to stave off interdose withdrawal. This is why it seems like it's working. These people are addicted, but they will swear up and down that they're not and the benzos are helping. That is the nature of addiction: rationalizing it.

>Clonidine also has several off-label uses, and has been prescribed to treat psychiatric disorders including stress, sleep disorders,\[28\] hyperarousal caused by post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, and other anxiety disorders.

Here's guanfacine's wiki page:

>An off-label use of guanfacine is for the treatment of anxiety, such as generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Guanfacine and other α2A agonists have anxiolytic-like action,\[15\] thereby reducing the emotional responses of the amygdala, and strengthening prefrontal cortical regulation of emotion, action and thought.\[16\] These actions arise from both inhibition of stress-induced catecholamine release, and from prominent, post-synaptic actions in the prefrontal cortex

***Anybody take clonidine or guanfacine for social anxiety? If so, please detail your experiences/dosages/etc. Thank you <3***

"So basically my life is chaotic, anxiety has been on high since I can remember, but as I've aged, it's gotten progressively worse. I think the worse, think of bad things, impending doom, dread, I have work anxiety, I hate my job and I literally lose my mind during my days off because I know the work week will be beginning soon..its affected my home life, my wife works in mental health and she's barely helping me, and my child is starting to see the affects. The only thing that scares me about ssri is the sexual dysfunction aspect, I don't want to risk damage to something I'm good at. 

But ny depression and anxiety has gotten the worse its ever been, I just want to take back my life..not end it. What's the best approach I can take meds wise. I meet with my psychiatrist next week.

"You could give them a try and see for yourself if it's worth it. I was on Citalopram for around 18 months. Sexual effects were medium for me. Could still get erections just fine but it was almost impossible to reach climax through intercourse. Sex drive decreased as well but I already started with a pretty high one so that wasn't an issue really. Still plenty left.

It was worth it to me back then because I needed the mental effects and I could still have sex, just differently. After the 18 months I had done the necessary work, decided the emotional blunting was getting boring and I quit.

Wellbutrin (bupropion) is used for depression and have low sexual side effects, for some it actually increase libido. Other alternative is ketamine if that's available in your area.

"There really isn't anything, and they all come with a compromise.  

The absolute best medications for what you describe are SSRI's, especially Sertraline, but this absolutely will have sexual side effects.  It can also make you impulsive.  You won't have any emotions - no ups or downs, just neutral.  You'll wonder why you ever let your emotions get the better of you, and when you see people being emotional you'll think ""pfft, how pathetic"".  Furthermore, you won't feel the desire to play video games or seek rewards because you'll be content.  Anxiety will no longer be a thing, and you'll wonder why you let yourself get so worked up over ""nothing"".  

Then there's the middle ground that works pretty much 50% of the time, which is stimulants.  They can give you some drive, help with confidence, give you a perspective shift, but you must act fast before tolerance kicks in, which is when you'll need to take breaks.  They can give you anorgasmia if you use them too often, and you'll need something like Sildenafil to help with the vasoconstriction.  You'll also get reduced natural rewards, but at least you'll have your emotions intact.  These can be tricky and make you quite moody and depressed when they wear off, so you'll need to keep that in mind and understand how you feel at any one time is a temporary state of mind influenced by external factors.  

Are you seeing a Psychologist? 

Most of the stuff people mentioned will make your hair fall out or make you fat, weak, or a combination of all 3.  

I can give you real answers about actual side effects that nobody talks about, but I'll be honest it sounds like talking to a Psychologist might help you a lot, based on what you've described so far.

"Sexual side effects may not occur. Especially if you are currently performing well. Sometimes the additional serotonin actually benefits sexual performance as lower serotonin activity promotes premature ejaculation. 

Consider getting blood work done looking at primary hormones, white & red blood cells, CRP, hba1c, liver & kidney function, vitamin D, B9, B12, and electrolytes. Maybe homocysteine as well. 

Personally I think an MAOI would suit you best. Do some reading on different drug mechanisms.

Within the next few months you may trial Bupropion, an SSRI or two, and maybe an anti-psychotic. One or two may work somewhat and you may get a side effect or two that you don’t like. Its part of the process unfortunately. I would attempt to trial an MAOI like Nardil at some point.

Other drugs like mood stabilisers may have use. Lithium, lamotrigine. 

You should consider lack of exercise as a cause for worsening symptoms. Worsening physical conditioning is indirectly related to psychiatric symptoms due to how it affects neurotransmitters and other variables that influence the nervous system. 

You will get frustrated during this process. You need to be prepared for that. It helps having some sustaining meaning like a family to keep you going."	christopherTraps88	reply	na	na	na	0.9957419037818909	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens
"When I was on Zoloft, sex drive stayed the same, and I just had issues with orgasm. That went away after a couple of weeks. I'm female mind you, so there may be some differences, but the mechanism is largely the same AFAIK. Doctors will usually switch you to an SNRI if it doesn't go away.

For what it's worth, I think the perceived risk of PSSD is being inflated somewhat by the fact that people without it feel much less compelled to post about it. Honestly kind of reminds me of r/insomnia's weird fixation on fatal insomnia, which is a super rare prion disease that literally under 100 people have had.

"History:

Tried lexapro when I was 19 because i had anxiety, mild, was getting urinary retention on it so stopped taking it.
When I was 25 I was put on Effexor for a depressive episode caused by a breakup (couldn’t eat, didn’t want to live, etc). Worked well but lost efficacy so I switched to Wellbutrin after a few months. 
While on Wellbutrin I was also given celexa and cymbalta at different times, both gave me urinary retention so I had to quit them. Also quit Wellbutrin because I was frustrated with the medical system at that time and Wellbutrin was making me quit smoking which made me irritable and angry and I didn’t realize it was not smoking and thought it was the medication. 
At 27 I had a mental break after suffering a panic attack, developed agoraphobia, and have since been living with severe anxiety and severe depression.
Buspirone didn’t help. I took it for multiple months but the higher the dose the more suicidal I felt. 
I was put on abilify, this gave me a manic episode where I felt great for a week and then hit very low lows where I was very suicidal. 
Switched to mirtazapine, same thing happened. 
Have been on Seroquel since, 150mg at night. Also take Ativan 2mg a day. 
Tried adding Wellbutrin in but it gave me severe anxiety and urinary retention with the Seroquel so quit Wellbutrin.
Doctor had me add gabapentin, 300mg three times a day. Felt it wasn’t helping, was making things worse. Been off that for a couple weeks now.

I am at a very low point. I am frustrated with my anxiety being constantly high. I am very suicidal, but I don’t want to die I just want to get better. I can’t stop having these thoughts though. 
I break down easily, will spend an hour crying for no reason. Even just writing this has sent me into a spiral. 

I don’t know what to ask my psych for next. She seems frustrated as well. She wanted to put me on vraylar last time but I was worried I’d get urinary retention because of the combo with Seroquel and said let’s just wait a month and see how just Seroquel goes. 

I don’t really want to increase my Seroquel because it makes me very tired and I’ve also gained a lot of weight and despite going to the gym everyday and (attempting to) diet, I can’t lose a pound. I come home and binge eat because I’m just so hungry. 

I’m thinking of getting off the Seroquel and trying just an antidepressant like Zoloft or something hoping I don’t get urinary retention (this is why we have been trying antipsychotics instead of SSRI’s because I thought they gave me urinary retention but after Wellbutrin and Seroquel combo I realize it might just be the combo of multiple medications causing it). 

I also just heard about anafranil and am considering that.

I’ve only been diagnosed with panic disorder, GAD, PTSD, and depression. 

I just want to get better, I have been living terribly since my panic attack and it’s getting really hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel when everything just leads to a dead end. 

My psych seems frustrated every time I see her, I only get 15 minutes so I need to make the most of it by being prepared when I go. Please help me."	sinistergrins	post	25.075450778440963	female	White	0.9977685213088989	na	na	na	28	depressionregimens

I really want to encourage you to seek out a new psychiatrist. I'm not saying yours is bad, but sometimes we need a new clinical perspective. I was diagnosed with BP2 for a long time. I tried well over a dozen antipsychotics and eventually got into a spravato treatment program. The provider there told me my antipsychotic could be making my depression worse. It was a horrible month of withdrawing, but now I'm doing so much better with a medication regimen of Zoloft and spravato. My diagnosis now is treatment-resistant depression.

I’m not saying replace all meds with weed by any means especially when you have more severe longer term mental health issues, but I could not live without my weed as an addition to my several meds everyday!! It can replace some medications like sleep or as any needed anxiety med or pain meds for example but if you haven’t tried it, start as slow as you can very small amounts and slowly increase so you don’t get too high which can cause anxiety. You can’t overdose even if it feels like it but it takes time to get your tolerance just right and will feels way stronger when you first start. Also different strains have different effects so if you don’t like one you can try another or use multiple different strains depending on how you’re feeling at the time of day like sativas or hybrids during the day indicas at night or for anxiety or panic attacks best of all it doesn’t interfere with regular meds	sinistergrins	reply	na	na	na	0.9977685213088989	no	no	strong	na	depressionregimens

It does not have the weight gain or other metabolic/organ effects that other antipsychotics are known for. I've actually been able to lose weight on it because it has helped my thought processes so much.	mccx2	reply	na	na	na	0.9994217157363892	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

Lithium is not at all drastic, and is a common augmentation strategy for TRD. MAOis are also a very reasonable option, and though most docs nowadays have little experience with them and are hesitant to start, there's no reason to avoid them forever if you're willing to go for it and the more common stuff isn't working.

At first the lithium was kind of a buffer just for the suicidal ideation. After a month or so I realized my mood swings had improved greatly and I could think clearer. My adhd is still something I struggle with a lot but I am currently off of stimulants because it messes with my anxiety. I also take Klonopin for panic attacks as well, and recently tapered off of effexor since i had been on it so long. I’m currently on Wellbutrin and it helps a bit with my adhd as well as depression.

"Mirtazapine ironically is one of the few antidepressants that make my feelings much worse.

First of all, it causes nightmares unlike anything I’ve had before.

Secondly, in the next day, I find my mood to be somewhat more depressed than usual.

It makes no sense, but nonetheless this is the effect it has on me.

This is purely speculation, but if I could guess why it has a negative effect on me, it could be due to the fact that Mirtazapine (from what I’ve read in the literature) has a side effect of partially activating what’s called the “Kappa Opioid Receptor”.
In layman’s terms, activating this receptor is a HELL-NO for depression, as it is responsible for causing feelings of intense dysphoria.
-> one scientific study actually warned about another drug, called Atomoxetine (used for ADHD), which also partially activates the Kappa Opioid Receptor, having a risk of exacerbating depression because of this very thing.

"Ok I understand what you are saying and I respect that but it is widely known that people diagnosed with Autism and or Asperger's do suffer from sensory issues. I do know what you mean about the DSM and the labelling (you are labelling yourself though?) but it's not the DSM that will be able to get you the treatment you need, a psychiatrist will though after correctly diagnosing you. I'm not sure which country you are in and how difficult that may be there?

It is also widely known that there are many crossover symptoms with a range of MH conditions. Take Schizophrenia and Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features - someone suffering from MDD with psychotic features may think they are schizophrenic due to the psychotic symptoms but until they go and see the appropriate doctor they do not know exactly what is going on and therefore the correct course of treatment.

I know trust me I know how fucked it is seeing these doctors taking the meds still suffering badly back to square one and start again but I think you owe it to yourself to give it a go as what you are going through sounds well debilitating as you have described.

Hey, so Mirtazapine at 15mg stopped working for sleep after being on it for 4,5 years. Suddenly, it does not make me sleepy anymore or sedate me, the only effect that remains is an increase in appetite and slight reduction in anxiety. My sleep is quite bad ever since and I was wondering if there are any alternatives that are as effective as mirtazapine or if you guys know any medication that has helped them as much as mirtazapine with sleep, anxiety reduction and sedation. I've already tried Trazodone and it does not really work for me. Quetiapine works well, but I don't want to take an antipsychotic on a daily basis since my main problems are sleep and anxiety.

"I take 75mg of Effexor XR and it changed my life. My anxiety manifests in my stomach, so I couldn't go further than 10 minutes walking distance from my house without having a panic attack, feeling sick, or having to have a bowel movement. Felt claustrophobic on the train or on any mode of transportation. Couldn't sit at a restaurant or go to a bar without feeling sick and losing my appetite. I stopped leaving the house for fear of having a panic attack. I immediately started to feel better within the first two weeks. Took care of the panic attacks so i stopped being afraid to leave the house. By the third week I could take the train again, sit in a loud busy restaurant, fly on planes. 7 months later, leaving the house being out of the house for extended periods of time doesn't really phase me. It gave me my life back foreal, I was a shell of myself before it. 

My psychiatrist also prescribed me 25mg of Propanolol which is a kind of beta blocker, basically stops your physical fight or flight response and is non-addictive. I truly don't understand the use of benzodiazepines like Xanax or Klonopin for anxiety when there are non-addictive forming drugs like this out there. When is was first starting Effexor and knew I had to go somewhere that would trigger a panic attack I'd take 15mg or Propanolol and it not only 100% prevented a panic attack, it also eased my mind a bit knowing that the physical symptoms wouldn't show up. I only needed to take it a few times before the Effexor started fully working and I didn't need it anymore.

"Practice when you’re not in that state. It’s not a quick fix by any means — I still panic in a lot of settings (public transport, traffic jams, a long line…I have agoraphobia, so anywhere I can’t quickly escape). 

But where ACT trumps CBT, IMO, is that it doesn’t claim to stop anxiety. It simply says you need to keep moving forward anyway. How do you want to live your life? Okay.

"I think the only major side effects I remember having on Paroxetine were occasional ""brain zap"" sensations and maybe a little bit of weight gain. It wasn't hard for me to come off of other than a little bit of dizziness for a few days, but my partner also took Paroxetine for a while, and they experienced nausea/vomiting, headaches, dizziness, etc. when they went off of it. I think a lot of the withdrawal symptoms come on if you go off of it cold turkey or reduce your dose too quickly--my partner's psychiatrist told them to wean off of it even slower than they already were to reduce the withdrawal symptoms, which seemed to help. I've also heard of people being prescribed a different SSRI that has less severe withdrawal symptoms temporarily when coming off of Paroxetine (ex. switching slowly from Paroxetine to Sertraline, then weaning off Sertraline), so there's definitely ways to reduce the severity of withdrawal symptoms if you do experience them"	Deesworld23	reply	na	na	na	0.7373759150505066	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

Just wanted to chime in. Everyone's experiences are different. I also suffer with panic attacks and agoraphobia. Was put on effexor and it also was a life changer. I was living again. Fast forward to having some heart issues that I was told was directly related to the effexor along with some other stuff it was doing. I tried for YEARS to get off it. The drug is great. Getting of it is like quitting heroin. If I was even late 2 hours of takin my effexor, my brain would swim and I would feel like I was on a boat. My whole family knew I had to have it, they would literally ask if I had it with me and remind me to take it cause I got so sick. I was completely reliant on it. If I ever couldn't get my hands on a refill ( which happened multiple times through the pharmacy)  I was completely bedridden and non functional. It got so old. I tried to do it the doctors way to come off where they throw you 25mg a week down and the withdrawal was still terrible. So I read more into to getting off of it, people were counting the beads out of the capsules by one to five beads at a time to get off of it. I eventually knew I had to just bite the bullet instead of suffer for a year counting beads, I went cold turkey in November. I am only just now somewhat stable. I wouldn't give that pill to anyone I loved or liked even a little bit. All my heart issues have went away as well as the other stuff. It truly saved my life but also damn near killed me when I quit it. Steer clear.	Deesworld23	reply	na	na	na	0.7373759150505066	weak	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"Hey, I’m 25 years old and have been doing very badly for the past year or so. 3 months ago I was diagnosed with adhd and moderate - severe anxiety. 

I went from not taking anything at all to being on:

Morning

50mg vyvanse + 10mg brintellix (Ssri)

Night

300 micrograms of clonidine  + 12.5mg mirtazapine

I didn’t start on this all overnight, but slowly over about a month. I’ve now been on this regime for 4 months

My life has NOT improved at all. The vyvanse helps in ways I couldn’t imagine when it comes to my work performance and concentration, but I hate how it makes me feel. Like a robot. I don’t want to socialise on it at all.

Brintellix seems to have done nothing at all. If anything my anxiety is worse and is turning into depression. I’m weening off it now and have mild withdrawals and I’m scared I’ll have permanently changed my brain. 

The clonidine, I don’t know if it does anything at all. 

The mirtazapine helps me fall asleep in like 5 minutes (used to take 1-3 hours) but doesn’t help me stay asleep. 

I have terrible health anxiety and have spent hours researching all of these meds and their possible side effects. I’m the type of person to research side effects and then convince myself I have them. 

I’ve read so many horror stories from people withdrawing off of mirtazapine and ssri’s and think it will happen to me. 

I don’t like this. I feel like my psychiatrist wants me to be on all these things but I want to stop. I’ve socially withdrawn so much. 

I also can’t keep living my life the way I was before these meds (I’m still living that same life after these meds) 

Please, any advice? Thanks"	thefinaldecisionfua	post	37.37396668073984	female	White	0.999392032623291	na	na	na	8	depressionregimens

So always tell your dr all the side effects good or bad you are having and any concerns so they can actually know how it’s effecting you cause that can help fine tune the medications. They will have the ability to actually help you get better if you tell them everything even things that seem unimportant.

Meds are not one size fits all just because something says it’s for anxiety doesn’t mean it’s right for *your* anxiety but usually there are several alternatives that may be great for you and terrible for someone else.

My world apparently, and I only figured that out by reading other people's accounts on r/ADHD. so i'm of the opinion that reading medical literature is unhelpful, but reading anecdotal evidence of other people taking the same medication can be very helpful!

"Np. I do also slightly respectfully disagree on the side effect lookup, considering if I didn't double-check a p-doc's work at times, I'd be hooked on some shitty drugs. But at the same time, despite me frequenting this sub, I do clearly see a lot of perseverating about which med to take to avoid permanent damage, and the cons of being on this or that for too long, and the worse case scenarios or the fringe bad-responders being exclusively focused on. At a certain point, it's not only unhelpful but actively harmful to one's mental health on top of whatever else is going on. 

In terms of actual empirical, personal benefit from the sub regarding pharmaceuticals, I passed that threshold long ago; I mainly lurk or pop in whenever there is something I might be able to help with, or like-minds/circumstances. Boredom, obviously too.

And obviously we both know there is no magic potion for most people. We're in essence just managing symptoms and buying more time until better treatments happen or we are able to improve our lifestyles or escape toxicity and process trauma. 

>Kohl’s

I refuse to call it this because I worked at Kohl's and it's a terrible company to work for and extremely unethical. Definitely has some occasionally great deals though. Very rare because most are absurd mark-ups on mediocre to shitty clothing.

"Ah okay. If you’re comfortable with your current SNRI then I can’t tell you to change it. But if the incident you’re talking about where your behavior was not acceptable and you upset people, you should ask your doctor if that could be a side effect of the medication. Because if it is, if its causing you aggression, or different behavior, then its maybe not the best choice.

Parnate was helpful but weird. It's a substituted amphetamine, so that part alone can do some strange things. If you don't do well with stimulants, Parnate might not be the best fit. I believe it's the only MAOI like this. I too noticed the crying, but for me it was a welcome change as I don't cry much even when I want to. Getting that was a huge release for me.

Lamictal technically takes effect over several weeks, but if you're like me, it took almost a year to notice a change. It's not that you feel better, it's that you look back and realize how stable the last year has been for you.

So maybe this post is out of pocket, but my mom gave me (20F) a 400 mg gabapentin, and I took it (albeit with a muscle relaxer (prescribed) and some benadryl) and I felt…. Normal. Not my normal, but what I feel like normal should be. It calmed my panicky suicidal thoughts. Ive been in such a suicidal spell the past week, and I do not feel suicidal right now. I dont know if its a placebo effect or if it has something to do with the combo, or if its just the gabapentin (benadryl usually just makes me sleepy if anything, and the muscle relaxers i take occasionally for my back pain) How would I ask my doctor about maybe taking this for my anxiety and depression? Obviously I took the gabapentin illegally, although I wasnt trying to get high or anything it still wasnt my prescription. Should I just tell him honestly what happened? Ive tried tons of antidepressants and they only mess me up, so if this could help… it could be life changing, I just want to be better.

I have ADHD that I currently take Vyvanse for, chronic insomnia that I take trazodone for, and am going to be talking with my doctor on Monday about my worsening depression. I’ve been doing some research on my own and finding a lot of conflicting answers. I’m seeing that Vyvanse with SSRI is fine with no interaction, and I also see people writing about how the medications they’ve been prescribed are cancelling each other out. 

I’m at a loss because I cannot stop my ADHD medication and I cannot take something during the day that will make me drowsy since I’m barely staying awake as it is.

"Either escitalopram or sertraline are typically good options to start with unless you have a compelling reason to start with something else.

As for interactions or canceling out the Vyvanse, NRIs have been shown to block some effects of amphetamines by reducing dopamine and norepinephrine (NE) release through the NE transporter. Theoretically, this would apply to bupropion and SNRIs but everyone responds differently and there are many people who do well on such combinations.

Another interaction could be that some anti-depressants inhibit CYP2D6 which is partially responsible for metabolizing amphetamine. Again, theoretically, strong CYP2D6 inhibitors might result in stronger or longer lasting effects of Vyvanse or might increase side effects. This could apply to fluoxetine, paroxetine and bupropion but again everyone responds differently."	boomoptumeric	reply	na	na	na	0.9974971413612366	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens

Yeah, because amphetamine releases dopamine by reversing the direction of dopamine transport through the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters drugs that block the transporters reduce this mode of dopamine release. 

Just note that It’s hard to say exactly what goes into the effectiveness of medications for specific symptoms. Bupropion may somewhat reduce the amount of dopamine/norepinephrine released by amphetamines, and that seems to extend to overall subjective effects and feeling high in recreational use but it doesn’t necessarily mean it impacts its effectiveness for ADHD in the same way."	boomoptumeric	reply	na	na	na	0.9974971413612366	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens

"I've been experiencing a loss of inner monologue and ability to visualize for around 7 months. I'm not sure how it started entirely. Alongside it, I've noticed issues with memory and very bad fatigue. I still have hypogenic hallucinations, sometimes when sitting from being very tired, but only outside of my head if that makes sense. Internally, I can't create an image or hear myself like I used to. 

 Another thing I would add is that people around me have described me as more instable and perhaps impulsive at times. I don't feel it personally though, I feel flat on the inside but my body is playing out things, I might lack awareness. I've also had comments from those close to me about dopiness, which has seemingly become more frequent. I agree with this, as it's become more difficult to keep with conversation and I sort of enter a 'nothing' state of no thought. 

I used to have running thoughts; I could be very imaginative, far more creative. I would jump from thing to thing, have things to chat about etc. Now, I just feel almost meditative quite a bit of the time, but also very depressed and out of it.  I experience  impending doom and more severe panic attack.

"The past year I've realized my SAD is really really bad, in part thanks to some others on Reddit a while back. Gloomy weather destroys me. I usually have a full on breakdown around Dec/Jan, then around Feb I tend to go into a seemingly endless depression where I'm lashing out at others. I manage it better now, but in the past it's pushed me pretty close to taking my own life.

I've obviously tried multiple SAD lamps, from cheap lightbulbs to ones costing hundreds. None really help much. Years ago I got to the point of trying my second MAOI ever, Nardil. That didn't get me through winter either, and people say that's arguably the strongest AD ever. Starting before last winter I caved and started ketamine treatment, and that may have helped a little more (no breakdown!) but it was still far from easy. Hell I got to the point of leaving drone videos of summer-type weather on my TV all the time, and playing video games set in warm/nice places!

That being said, it also depends on what you're taking the gabapentin for. If it's for anxiety, then sometimes the anxiety flush is a bitch to deal with. However, there are far fewer withdrawal side effects coming off of Gabapentin then off of most SSRIs, and I've been on all of them. They all suck to come off of. 

I've stopped gabapentin cold turkey and been fine. But like I said, it really depends on why you take it. I've taken it for insomnia before and when I didn't need it, I quit taking it. But now I take it for anxiety, and getting the anxiety back after coming off sucks.

"I've had recurrent major depressive episodes for decades and anxiety that ranges from mild to panic attacks and 'can't leave the house' episodes, diagnosed as autistic 5 years ago and ADHD 2 years ago. 

Currently taking Pristiq 100mg, lamotrigine 200mg, dexamphetamine, metoprolol 25mg x 2, Zoely (birth control) for PMDD. 

I've been stuck in a depressive episode for a year or so with fairly consistent passive suicidal ideation. My dr tried adding back mirtazapine, didn't help, so discontinued that. Then increased the Pristiq from 50 to 100mg which hasn't helped a whole lot and has increased my anxiety hugely. 

The metoprolol was added a couple years ago by a cardiologist for inappropriate sinus tachycardia that was worsening my anxiety, and I'm fairly certain the Pristiq is making it worse but I don't know where to go from here. I have a psychiatrist I've been seeing for a long time but his suggestions were either increasing the Pristiq again or cross tapering to fluoxetine. Another suggested swapping to duloxetine stating that the discontinuation is easier (which from what I've seen is entirely incorrect). So I'm turning to you all for some lived experience advice.

I've tried a number of medications in the past, most were somewhat effective but pooped out, including escitalopram, sertraline, mirtazapine (as mentioned above), and agomelatine. I'm located in Australia which does impact the medications available to some extent. I'd ideally work towards discontinuing the Pristiq entirely but I'm looking for suggestions for alternatives to trial and/or something to augment the current regimen to help get me there.

However, when reading the package leaflet I noticed ”sudden inexplicable death” as one possible side effect. Is this something to be concerned about?

"A lot of drugs cause this side effect. Most antidepressants and also a lot of antibiotics cause QT prolongation. It’s only really an issue for people with heart rhythm disorders like long QT syndrome. These are disorders due to electrical conductivity issues with the heart. Nothing to do with things like cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, high cholesterol etc.

If you have any relatives who were healthy and suddenly died (particularly during adolescence or their twenties), then you might have genetic risk factors. Healthy young people who die suddenly like these usually die due to conditions affecting heart rhythms. I’m NAD but I believe it causes cardiac arrest when it happens.

So if you have no family history of this stuff and no relatives who died like this, I honestly would not be worried.

If you are concerned, why not request an ECG before starting the medication? They can be performed by nurses in most medical practices and only take about 20 minutes. You could then have a follow up ECG after being on the meds for a month or so to make sure everything is still good with your heart rhythm."

My psychiatrist told me I should be lowering my amitriptyline to 50mg and eventually to nothing. He explained that the anticholinergic effects of the drug are counteracting the vyvanse. But, my depression and anxiety have not been an issue on the Amitriptyline. *He did mention* ***Mirtazapine*** *as an antidepressant that has a low incidence of sexual side effects, which, I have had with pretty much all of the antidepressants I have tried.* 

My GP and I have come to the conclusion that I will likely need a drug that has some sort of serotonergic effect for the foreseeable future. This seems to be challenged by my psychiatrist. 

I have been looking into Mitrazpine after my psychiatrist mentioned it. *(I actually asked my GP about mirtazapine before he said I should try amitriptyline)* It seems to have the same efficacy as amitriptyline with a better side-effect profile. Especially with **weight gain**. Which has been a big struggle with amitriptyline.

**Has anyone been on mirtazapine and experienced any lack of concentration, forgetfulness, lack of motivation or sleepiness after being on the drug for a period of time?** *(these are a few things I have noticed with the amitriptyline)*

**Weight gain?** *(I have gained 13kg on amitriptyline)*

**ADHD and mirtazapine?**

**Any insight into this is helpful as I can't look at the pharmacology and studies forever!**

"Been on mirtazapine for a year, low dose, one a night. 

Sleep like a dream, real heavy sleep. Fixing my sleeping pattern and getting regular scheduled hours made me more able to do things with my time. I started cycling and working out which I never could before. I've lost loads of weight since taking it so the increased appetite isn't a bummer if you're exercising regularly.

Early side effects were some grogginess and odd hand eye coordination issues. I was clumsy for about a week. Disappeared after a while and no further issues. 

Less anxious and less depressed but I also cut out weed entirely, cut back on alcohol, quit smoking and was more active and getting regular sleep and spending more time outdoors. All those things are just as good as any prescription medication for reducing anxiety and depression and I was only able to do them because of mirtazapine.

"Whereas amitriptyline and mirtazapine are more likely to make one drowsy and feeling sedated bupropion (wellbutrin brand name) is more a stimulant which is very useful for someone who has the type of depression which makes it hard to get out of bed.  

Rather than comparison studies I find the best information by looking up individual drugs and then reading their side effects profiles.

https://www.drugs.com/mirtazapine.html
Common mirtazapine side effects include:
drowsiness, dizziness;
increased appetite; or
weight gain.


https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519059/
Adverse Effects
Mirtazapine has several significant side effects. The adverse effects which occur in greater than 10% of the people taking the drug include:

Drowsiness (54%)
Weight gain (12%)
Xerostomia (25%)
Increased serum cholesterol (15%)
Constipation (13%)
Increase in appetite (17%)
Sedation
Thrombocytopenia[24]
bone marrow suppression and neutropenia[25][26]
hypertriglyceridemia[27]
Acute pancreatitis(rare but life-threatening ADR)[28]
A Cochrane review conducted in 2011 found that compared to other antidepressants, mirtazapine is more likely to cause drowsiness and weight gain but less likely to cause tremors and sexual dysfunction

Yeah! I was really hopeful about Wellbutrin. (bupropion) But, it didn't do anything for me! 😭 Plus, I could only get SR formulation in Australia as bupropion XL is not used here and bupropion is only subsidised for smoking cessation (Zyban SR) So, I was prescribed that off-label for depression but if things aren't subsidised here, drug companies don't really bring it to market unless there is great demand. Also, it costs a fortune to get it off-label. Anyways, I think maybe if I had something that could stay in my system longer it might work better but, I felt like it was an up and down battle.

"Hello all, I’ve been here before but first time posting just bc I want to get a idea of other people’s thoughts on this.. so I’m going to try to make it simple and short as possible.

I was diagnosed with anxiety in 2nd grade, I had a panic attack watching SpongeBob out of no where with family that is my earliest memory of a panic attack.. my anxiety quells from a major fear of vomiting, idk why I just had bad memories of it. So I was prescribed 50mg Zoloft (sertraline) daily, never really did anything for me but took it consistently throughout my years from elementary, middle, and high school. Going into college is where all hell broke lose. I stopped taking it at this time. I didn’t notice anything difference but a lot of factors come into play which would lead to what I am getting at with depression and a official diagnosis. My dorm was religiously too hot, ac was not really a thing, and in winter it was a desert. My sleep went from getting 8 hours a night to 4-5, sometimes 6. Only 8 when I was horrendously tired. My motivation that I had for lifting (used to be a extreme gym goer, bodybuilding goals (natural not taking steroids or enhancing subs), I was driven and extremely goal oriented. Then after the years my routine would thought college to now would decline and go into absolute hell. I have no motivation to workout, do anything, I feel like a husk. I went to a psychiatrist and I did a DNA test to see what works best and it was sertraline however it didn’t work the best and we switched meds. Here is everything I have tried and I am requesting to get a MAOI after some research.. im losing some hope that I will get back to being how I was and wanted to see if anything you guys recommend anything or what options I have

What I have tried in order:
-Wellbutrin (max dose)
-sertraline (max dose)
-Effexor (max dose)
-lexapro (max dose)
-paxil (mass dose)
-ketamine IV drip
-seroquel (sleep aid)
-modafinil and armodfanil 

Something’s to add: 
-getting out of bed is hard
-hygiene is hard
-loss of motivation
-loss of caring about myself
-feeling bad about myself
-I’ve been tested for sleep apnea and hormones, everything is fine, blood panels and sleep studies done
-I check off the box literally on everything for adhd so idk if that is something to take in

"I had a terrible period of trying different meds with nothing working and my condition deteriorating. One thing that helped were beta blockers, which take the edge off the physical symptoms of anxiety - the high heart rate, sweating, shaky voice, that really helped. Taking clomipramine 75mg now and I'm fairly stable, this seems to be helping. Good luck and don't give up, something will work.

Also I think it's absolutely key to maintain good habits - exercise, decent nutrition, enough sleep and avoiding stress.

"Hey all, I'm at my wit's end trying to deal with the sexual side effects of SSRIs and I'm trying to come up with a creative solution. I have tried many different SSRIs (lexapro, zoloft, luvox, viibryd) and they all of the effect of causing extreme sexual dysfunction/numbing, even at a very low dose. I've tried adding wellbutrin and buspirone as add-ons - no effect whatsoever.

I'm currently on 10mg of prozac, which I actually like as an antidepressant. For me it's energizing, does not cause anhedonia, and helps significantly with my anxiety and panic symptoms. But I just don't know how much longer I can take the genital numbness and anorgasmia.

Out of desperation, I'm considering an unorthodox dosing schedule where I e.g. take the 10mg of prozac for two weeks or a month and then cycle off of it for the same length of time. The goal of this would be to give myself a window of time every month or so where I could actually enjoy sex with my partner. Due to the long half life of prozac, I doubt I would experience any withdrawal symptoms, but obviously this could be a concern.

Has anyone here tried cycling an SSRI like this in order to make the side effects more tolerable long term? What were your experiences like?

Update (for anyone reading this thread in the future): I tried this out and it seemed to work well! Stopped taking the 10mg of prozac cold turkey on a Sunday, had zero side effects (and no increase in anxiety), and had my full sexual functioning back by the next Friday. Enjoyed that for a few days and then started on the 10mg dose again. Now that I know how easy it is, I'll probably cycle off in order to have fulfilling sex once every month or two.

"Hey! Not sure if you're a guy or a girl but perhaps it doesn't matter - I've dealt with similar issues from SSRIs (specifically ED + anorgasmia). Trust me when I say I know how immensely frustrating and depressing it is.

Two ideas:

- Trintellix and Viibryd are both touted as being SSRI-like drugs with less sexual side effects. Could be worth asking your provider about these meds.

- One suggestion my doctor made was skipping a dose on the night you're planning on having sex - or delaying it. Personally I felt like this was a risky idea but... I've heard others tinkering with their dosing time for this reason.

- For ED, Viagra + Cialis work. For anorgasmia, there's nothing I've heard about. For low libido... I'm not sure what options there are other than buproprion and changing the offending agent.

At this current point I am not depressed / haven’t been for 1.5 months. My mood shifts every several months…. my clinical team thinks I have bipolar disorder - not sure how much I agree with this assessment but I guess it’s possible.

I had thoughts that i do not realize im in hell and I slowly looked back at my life and how miserable it is and it felt like a veil was lifted and i got really scared realizing this and I felt like i wanted to scream.

"as I understand it, MAOIs are misunderstood, but effective, I like to see it as a form of ""black magic"" (ofc they dont have magical properties like 100% curing anything).

I think we need to go down memory lane and look at history of MAOIs.

the first antidepressant and MAOI was Iproniazid (discovered by accident when trying to make a drug for tuberculosis and the researchers noticed people were less depressed while on them), back around 1950 and a few decades forward we knew we little about Tyramine and their interaction with MAOIs,

Tyramine is an amino acid which exists in aged products like aged cheese (I add a looooong diet guide bellow). Tyramine can cause high blood pressure spikes in combination with MAOIs, enough to kill people if eating unresponsibly.

people ate aged cheese and other products like usual and a few people died (iirc only observed deaths come from cheese consumption while on MAOIs).

TCAs were invented also in the 1950s and I assume MAOIs were seen as a liability because of the deaths, so doctors preferred TCAs over MAOIs, and then later SSRI and SNRIs.

some time Im guessing ~20 year later or so, the patent of MAOIs run out, so anyone could produce them = also less money to be made, not that attractive to companies especially with them being a danger back then, and then they got outcompeted by other antidepressants so they dont even sell MAOIs in all markets because they believe the consumption would be too low to be an idea to sell them (at least not here in Europe).

nowadays, processing food is quicker than it was back then, so food goes from field to mouth much faster and therefor produces much less Tyramine. 

MAOIs interaction with Tyramine has been researched better now, so we understand the diet restrictions (which doesnt seem to be that bad imo, its basically aged=bad).

its probably also a pain in the ass for psychiatrists to learn how to use MAOIs, their interactions and teaching the patient about the diet.

as I understand it, the reason why SSRIs are so popular are because of mild side effects rather than they being effective.

As for the TMS thing, I would recommend keeping an eye out for SAINT protocol TMS availability later this year, if you can wait that long. It's accelerated TMS, the sessions are condensed to 10 treatments a day (10, 10-minute sessions with 50-minutes of rest) for 5 days, I believe.

Sometimes birthdays aren’t happy days, and that’s OK. There’s nothing wrong with feeling bad. Feel what you feel. When I feel this way, and I often do, I try not to beat myself up for feeling the way I do. I try not to do anything with it. It seems the more I fight it, the more it sticks with me. So just relax on your bed. Maybe take a nap or watch something on TV. Just be. For what it’s worth, I’m glad you were born. Happy birthday to you — even if it isn’t. It’s OK.

"There's an expectation to be happy and excited on your birthday as you say which ironically makes it all that much worse. Anytime there's an expectation to feel a certain way it creates tension and anxiety. I treat birthdays as if they were for little kids like a dollar from the tooth fairy. Also physical gifts are the worst kind. They take up space. You generally don't want them. And anything I actually want, I'll get myself. Now if someone knows you well and puts thought into a present that's different. But I think people generally give gifts more out of expectation than a genuine impulse to give something that may serve you as a tool in this life.

If you want to be silly on your birthday and people ask what did you do for your birthday, say its your 29th birthday say I ate 29 grains of Ben's Original Instant Rice followed by 29 push ups followed by the sharpening of 29 pencils followed by ... then of course pause and when the other person starts talking say let me finish then continue"	call_me_mommy__	reply	na	na	na	0.9994878768920898	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"I've been on every antidepressant under the sun. SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, RIMAs, stimulants, the works. 

But I'll let you guys in on a secret I wish I learned earlier in life... if your lifestyle makes you miserable, medication will not fix that. I know from experience. If you hate your life, no medication in the world is going to make you magically start liking it. 

Medication opens a door, but we have to be the ones to walk through it. The right combination of medications can make it *possible* for you to be happy, but you have to also create the conditions in your life where you actually *can* be happy. 

I consider my depression mostly cured, or at least under extremely good control, and I would attribute maybe 30% of that to my meds (27mg methylphenidate for depression and 2x150mg pregabalin for anxiety). The rest is attributed to the fact that my life today is basically nothing like how my life was a few years ago. 

I divorced my emotionally abusive ex-husband, spent time reflecting on who I am and who I wanted to be, remodelled my career into something I love (bioinformatics), started leaning *hard* into my truest self instead of running from it, and stopped giving a shit about what other people think of me. I guess that last one is the bonus of turning 30. 

Don't chase after the life script you think will appease others. Do what you actually want to do. 

Want to move away to another city or province/state and start anew? Do it. No time like the present. 

Want to declare yourself a queer furry and build a friend group of others like you? Do it. So what if people think you're weird, you do you. 

Yes, I know it's an oddly specific example. It's me. But the principle applies overall - pursue what you want to pursue, and fuck anyone that stands in the way of it. Believe me, you'll be 1000x happier for it. I sure am!"	proteomicsguru	post	32.95934962096256	male	White	0.0015555567806586623	na	na	na	21	depressionregimens
"I’ve been on all the meds you listed as well, plus MAOIs, ketamine, buprenorphine, antipsychotics, you name it. And I agree that medication can only do so much. When I was in a very toxic home dynamic and when I dreaded going into my job as the managing editor for startup, no medication was going to make me happy despite horribly depressing life circumstances (especially the situation at home). 

I moved away from my toxic family (I went as far as moving to another country), I met my now husband (married a few months ago), I got onto medications that didn’t have horrific side effects (in my case that happened to be Stablon and low dose methylphenidate), and shifted into journalism which is much more fulfilling for me. Now, I’m 7.5 months pregnant. All this happened during my 30th year as well. Turned 31 a couple of months ago. 

The medication (which I’m temporarily off of because I’m pregnant) helped get me to a place where I was capable of making these changes but the changes themselves are probably what helped more than anything. The reason I feel confident about that is because now that I’m pregnant and not medicated for the first time in over a decade, my baseline is significantly higher than it used to be. If I went off meds two years ago.. I dread to think. 

I’d have never made these changes if it weren’t for medication though. To me, the two (meds and lifestyle change) were equally necessary. Without meds, I couldn’t have made the lifestyle changes. Without the lifestyle changes, the meds just kept me from giving up entirely but really didn’t improve my quality of life. 

I also exercise now (I hate when people recommend exercise so if you’re reading this, please don’t hate me) and frankly, it does actually make a big difference.

Methylphenidate and pregabalin are strong medications that aren’t even indicated for use for depression. The fact is that antidepressants and antipsychotics simply don’t work well and along with their host of awful side effects typically leave patients worse off than before they started any medication. My point being; off-label medications for depression need to be either approved for depression or prescribed off-label more frequently and aggressively. Patients shouldn’t need to suffer through 10 antidepressants, 10 antipsychotics, and 10 atypical medications for a decade before being considered a candidate for off-label medications.

Methylphenidate has been used in depression regimens for decades, although it is an off-label usage. I've known multiple psychiatrists who use it when other standard antidepressants fail. So this comment is very misleading. 

Pregabalin is indicated for anxiety, which is what it's prescribed to me for, as I said in the post. Maybe you could dial down the unreasonably patronizing tone a few notches?

"When weeks turn into months turn into years, when you fail enough treatments, you will inevitably start to wonder, is it just me? Have the antidepressants been working this whole time and this is who I fundamentally am as a person?

You have been depressed your entire adult life. At the end of high school it crept up on you; you didn't even notice it at first. You pushed your friends away, your grades dropped from A's to B+s (a normal thing considering it was the second half of senior year and you were biding time), and you spent more time alone. You refused to admit something may be wrong; you were just having a bad year. But it festered, the rot spreading over years until you were a shell of who you once were. You were failing out of university. You had only a few friends. The only people who loved you, loved you by requirement. You felt alone, and tired, and empty. You were put on meds that triggered a suicide attempt and were put on new drugs. You told yourself they helped even though in hindsight, they made things worse. You spent the next several years trying to scrape by every semester while alternating between different treatments. You even took a year and a half off of university where you lay in bed and didn't do much else. Every semester would start the same: you would convince yourself that you were fine, that you were just being lazy and needed to try harder. The work wasn't hard, you just needed to actually do it, something you found impossible to do. You had tried Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Amphetamines, Pristiq, trazadone, supplements, TMS, genetic testing, a clinical trial; and yet you still felt the same. It is incredibly disheartening to watch videos of people sobbing about how a treatment changed their life when it did absolutely nothing for you. You start to doubt yourself, even knowing you were dealt a bad genetic hand and that depression runs heavily in your family.

Maybe TMS did work.

Maybe you aren't depressed at all.

Maybe it fixed your depression and all that remains is your lack of willpower.

You feel pathetic.

You feel ashamed.

You feel like you have ruined your entire life before it has even started.

It takes a lot to admit to yourself that you are not ok. That you are one semester from failing out of school and that you have been lying to everyone in your life, telling them that you were doing well because you were too embarrassed to tell them that you were failing at things you would normally find easy. After an argument with your psychiatrist where you begged him to put you on an MAOI, an entirely new classification of meds for you, he finally obliges. It does nothing, but at this point you are used to it. A genetic mutation in the CYP2C19 gene requires you to take such high doses that when you would list your medications, doctors looked at you with shock and asked ""why on earth are you on that dose?"" (Apparently 400mg of Wellbutrin is not the norm.)

But then one day, after moving again to the highest dose, you get out of bed on time. You make tea. You get work done. You read. You knit. You think it's a fluke but it happens again, and again, and again. You are by no means cured; you still have bad days and you are still depressed, but for the first time in 6 years you actually feel functional. You scramble to do the things you were too anxious to do a few months ago. You realize you have been exhausted for 6 years, and for the first time, you are not.

I know how it feels to hear of the magical treatment that “cured” someone's depression, maybe even most people's depression, but did absolutely nothing for you. It feels like you are broken, that it is your fault, and if you just tried a little harder, you could put your life in order and feel whole. I don't want to do that. What helped me may do nothing for you– but I do want to tell you that it's not you, it's most likely your brain chemistry. As someone who had completely lost hope and believed that I was stuck being a person I hated forever, switching medications changed my life. It was gradual, but I feel human again. I no longer feel like the decaying husk of a person. Even though it’s subtle, it feels like magic.

I don't know if my treatment will work for you, or what treatments will. There's a good chance mine won't, especially since it is rarely prescribed. What I do want to remind you though is that it's *not* your fault, you are *not* alone, you are *not* crazy, and if you are still feeling like absolute shit, **try something different.**"	Archy_thecockroach	post	22.158520626941936	female	White	0.9981169700622559	na	na	na	45	depressionregimens

"I mean, there’s a perfectly good explanation for this. GeneSight doesn’t tell you which medications will work for you. It just tells you how you will metabolize them, which in turn, informs you of an increased (or decreased) risk of side effects/tolerability. And, it lets you know if you’ll need a higher or lower dose of said medication. These factors all play into medication effectiveness, but in no way will it definitively tell you if it will work for you or not. There are many other factor besides metabolism that play into medication effectiveness. 

Newer medications, such as Pristiq, were created to (1) use multiple pathways for metabolism so that if you have one defective pathway, the medication has other routes to go through and it does not cause a huge effect on medication tolerability; and (2) use pathways that don’t commonly have genetic mutations. 

For this reason, almost everyone will have Pristiq in the green. I’m sure you had Trintellix and Viibryd on the green too.

It's definitely hard to not blame yourself.

"Sure! In 2018, because I failed a certain number of medications, my insurance covered Genomind, a pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic genetic variations test. The first half of the report covers your genetic makeup and the second half covers your potential drug interactions. My report showed that I had a ton of genetic variations, many of which signified that I had an increased risk of poor reaction for entire classifications of drugs. 

The mutation I was specifically referring to was with Cytochrome P450 2C19 (aka. CYP2C19 or 2C19) which is important in the metabolism of wide range of drugs, including a significant number of antidepressants. I have the CYP2C19\*17 novel allele variant, which increases gene transcription and therefore results in the ultra-rapid metabolizer phenotype. This means that I metabolize a lot of drugs much faster than the average person, which also decreases my serum levels, leads to poorer efficacy, and leads to possible adverse events associated with toxic metabolites. It also means that I often need much higher dosages of a drug for it to be effective, and the higher the dose, the more likely I am to experience unwanted side effects. Even though I'm not an ultra-rapid metabolizer for all drugs, I have found that I often need the highest dose of most anti-depressants (even the ones that don't use 2C19 as the primary metabolizing enzyme) in order to feel any of its effects. 

In the case of Wellbutrin (a drug that doesn't actually have 2C19 as the primary metabolizing enzyme), I only began to really feel the effects at 300mg and felt the most benefit at 450mg (for reference the starting dose is 100-150mg, the max is usually 300mg, and I am a tiny person) . Unfortunately at 450mg, if I took my doses too close together, or accidentally took it twice, I would start to hallucinate spiders... which wasn't great lol. I also realized only recently that while it helped with my depression, it gave me mad anxiety to the point where I was just as low-functioning as I would be without it.

As everyone on that sub will tell you, its definitely an under-prescribed medication and one of the most effective ones.

"Hmm, I sometimes wonder if I'm a rapid metabolizer because I haven't found any long-term med to be therapeutic. But I thought, perhaps wrongly, I do have side effects which theoretically should quickly be out of the system too.

Trying wellbutrin again right now. With wellbutrin I do have noticeable minor side effects with the med (slight tinnitis, constipation, increased anxiety possibly), which makes me think yeah something is definitely happening up there. But to theoretically double the questionably perceptible therapeutic effect to side effect ratio with a dose increase has made me hesitant.

I should just go through getting a genetic sequencing and homebrew the data and stop wondering. I was researching that years ago before promethease sold out.

"It's definitely possible! I do want to point out that being an URM is one of *many* different genetic variations that could be responsible for why you haven't found any long term med to be therapeutic; that was just one of the mutations the report specified I had, and the report only covered a niche area of brain genetics as it was only looking at potential drug effectiveness/interaction. 

The side effect/therapeutic effectiveness ratio won't necessarily stay consistent as you increase dosage, so it's possible that your benefit will increase significantly more or vice vera. If you're finding Wellbutrin helpful but it doesn't feel like enough, it may be worth trying out a higher dose. Side effects are also usually worst in the beginning and fade with time. 

While genetic sequencing can definitely be helpful and is very interesting, it should also be taken as suggestion, not rule. I've found it to be pretty accurate with what I have reacted well/poorly to (ie. everything I've reacted poorly to was in the ""use with caution"" column), but just because you are at an increased risk for something having adverse side effects, doesn't mean it absolutely will. It's good at generally directing you at which medications to look at, but it won't tell you with any confidence which meds will or will not work. Our form of mental health treatment is still very much ""lets throw things at the wall and hope something sticks."" Genetic testing is basically telling you which wall you may want to aim at.

I can no longer get a legitmate supply and also would like to take proper pharma grade pills.   
I have tried several other antidepressants but have many side effects, especially when I try to come off sulfate. (Insomnia, severe anxiety, zero stress resilience)  


Does anybody know how to get this prescribed. I am in the UK, but willing to travel in Europe? I think i would need 3x a day dosing which is what is recommended. As 75mg sulfate equates to about 30mg sodium (stablon).

Does anyone know how I could go about this? I can go to France but know it is quite difficult there and they only give a 28 day supply. Are there other parts of Europe. Also please DM me for details, ordering from Asia. I can see some but it is very expensive. 10 tablets for $10 dollars and you need 3 day, also quite a lot of boxes which is suspicious.

"Hi guys- just wanted to share this post as I’ve been thinking about this a bit more recently- regarding adderrall and my depression.  Wondering what others may have experienced.  

Currently I’m diagnosed with MDD, ADHD, and OCD. 

Though I’d be lying if I said I remember the details from this point of my life well when I began taking adderrall, here’s what I recall - I’ll do a timeline so it’s easier to read. 

20 years old- started feeling chronic depression and having suicidal thoughts… 

This is when I also began experimenting w my moms adderrall which I felt helped me focus like none other.., 

This was also when I felt like my OCD was at its worst (didn’t know what it was at the time) 

22- got  sober - felt like depression lifted for first time in years.  Intrusive OCD thoughts ceased. 

I still took adderrall but was very aware that if I went even a day without taking it, I was literally in such a low state that I could almost not bear it.    Adderrall had an immediate effect on my mood but going without was NOT good for me. 

27- depression and OCD got a lot worse again.  Still taking adderrall 


28-29 - depression started lifting a bit - would be totally lying if I remember any sort of timeline or cause and effect  - I just know for maybe 2-5 months I weaned off adderrall during this time.   

Even when my depression wasn’t nearly as severe, I started taking adderrall again and decided the reward of increased focus and productivity was worth it for me. 

35-40-  still take adderrall and struggle w chronic depression and OCD and have for most of last 5 years - I don’t have the crazy withdrawals I used to when it comes to adderrall - I can go days without taking it and don’t notice a huge change aside from eating more. 

I tried taking some “holistic adderrall alternative” while taking lower adderrall dosage, and it didn’t do shit for me.  Taking higher dosage of adderall can still help improve my mood and productivity a bit, but typically I need to take more than prescribed. It’s been hard getting my psychiatrist to agree to increasing dosage even though I’ve taken it without abusing it for nearly 20 years. 


Basically, here’s the gist of reason for my post and what feels like my challenges. 

* I want to greatly reduce my depression symptoms - 

* I wonder if adderrall may have triggered more depression in me as well as more “positive feelings”  

* Adderrall continues to, in my experience, help me get going with my day and be reasonably productive 

* I do not want to stop taking adderrall, but if it somehow became very obvious that it was the “core” problem of my depression and I could find a sufficient alternative that helped me be productive still and less depressed, I’m all ears!"

"Is Adderall the only medication you're taking at the moment? 

Adderall is similar for me, it does a lot of heavy lifting for me in my day-to-day life and I'm not very functional without it. However, I take a lot of other meds for my depression, which helps keep it at bay.

I'm not positive that Adderall made my depression worse, just that depression is a moving target."	Fancy_Programmer_595	reply	na	na	na	0.01733582466840744	no	strong	strong	na	depressionregimens
"Anecdotal, methylphenidate seems to be a miracle drug for depression. But because of the potential for abuse it gets downplayed. There’s gotta be a happy medium like with benzodiazepines. I don’t have addiction issues so I really think methylphenidate could help me. 

In your case you’ll probably have to go off it for a while and try other things to answer your question."	Fancy_Programmer_595	reply	na	na	na	0.01733582466840744	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
My experience with Adderall was similar. The focus was amazing early on and the mood boost was a wonderful bonus. But wow that cliff when the drug wears off. It was always a helluva slump for me. It’s like my mood battery would go from 100% to 5% in the span of 15 minutes. It also interfered with my sleep, so I used a drug to help with that. Not a good program. Even so, I ran with it for many years. Then I switched to Vyvanse and that worked a lot better for me. The mood shift was far more subtle when the drug wore off. And yet, it still screwed up my sleep. I grew tired of the whole cycle about 5 years ago and stopped taking any medication. I got serious about stabilizing my sleep habits with education and practice, and that helped immensely. I also added in long daily walks and a meditation practice. There’s no doubt the effect of both those drugs was strong and positive in the short term, but the effect was reduced over time and I struggled with mood stability. I still have concentration challenges, but for me the trade-off wasn’t worth it. As for depression, it still comes to visit. In fact, I’m sitting alone scrolling these pages now because I couldn’t muster the energy to join my wife for a dinner planned with a friend. I’m blessed with a very understanding partner. In the past, I would have used one of those meds to give myself a charge so I could rally. Again, that’s appealing for it’s immediate payoff. I don’t pretend to have an answer for anyone else, but this is the right one for me. I hope something about my reply is helpful for you. Wishing you peace.

"So I started Abilify a couple weeks ago and was doing pretty well on that. I was also tapering off Viibryd so I was on about 10 mg of Viibryd for most of the last couple weeks. I've now come off the viibryd completely and started Clomipramine. 

I'm not feeling as good, less energy more blah feeling. I of course can't determine if it's a side effect from the Clomipramine or if it's due to being off the Viibryd but I feel like 10 mg is so little after being on 40 mg for two years that that wouldn't make that much of a difference.

I also would suggest looking into lithium. SSRIs and SNRIs did very little for me, I survived daily life only thanks to benzos. When I finally consented to trying lithium I found it immediately helpful and have been on it for four years now. My dosage has fluctuated but what really matters are your blood levels. I believe the therapeutic range for depression is ~0.6-0.8 and for mania/acute episodes it is ~0.8-1.2. I was at 0.7-0.9 while getting stabilized. For the past year though I’ve been able to be at just 0.4, which is ideal as too much lithium can cause damage to your kidney or thyroid functions. In terms of side effects, I just am thirstier (it is also very important to drink plenty of water while taking lithium). I did notice hand tremors and brain fog any time I got above 0.7.		reply	na	na	na	0.9977192282676697	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"Tranylcypromine is a beast of its own. It seems to vary significantly person-to-person AND based on the dosage. I usually roll my eyes when people say this, but this is something I believe you have to have first-hand experience to assess how it will work for you. 

IME, At lower doses it seemed to work alright for me for productivity and anhedonia. I still had some issues with avolition but I was content. It didn’t work well for anxiety until getting to 60 mg+ dosage range, but then the avolition, apathy, and blunting were too much. 

What was confusing for me through the process was the stimulant-like effect of acute dosing. I confused this with the antidepressant effect. At first, it felt like adderall with no comedown or anxiety component. That stimulating feeling went away after a couple months and it was replaced with fatigue immediately post-dose. That never really went away for me. I titrated down and was getting better. I think the right dosage for me could be 20-30mg, as it doesn’t have much of an effect on serotonin at this stage and a lot of my symptoms align with ADHD-PI. 

Doses even at 5-20 mg still had an effect for me. There’s data that shows that 10 mg TCP can inhibit MAO-A and MAO-B quite significantly.

I’m trying high dose oral selegiline for it’s stimulating metabolites with longer half lives (24 hrs) and for its preference in binding to MAO-B rather than MAO-A. Much of the research seems to point to MAO-A being more impactful on dopamine degradation though, hence why I’m doing high enough doses (30-60mg) to impact that as well.

It’s only been about a month of titrating up and I’ve  only just got to 35 mg/day after a high fat breakfast. I’m going to give it a shot up to 45 mg/day and if any benefit occurs, maybe even higher. My doc is comfortable going up to 45 mg and is willing to explore 60 mg if there’s an indication of benefit."	Pinbacked11	reply	na	na	na	0.9967166781425476	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

It’s still serotogenic so it affects 5HT-2(A),(C) receptors which are common in producing a blunting effect for some individuals.

Vyvanse, Methylphenidate ER, Adderall, Concerta are all central nervous stimulants. STIMULANTS!

Hopefully some type of stimulant that’s completely, or mostly, abuse-proof will be developed that can be used for depression. The current antidepressant options are disappointing to say the least

Ansofaxine, an SNDRI, might be beneficial if it’s not a norepinephrine and serotonin overload. It has values of 723 nM, 763 nM, and 491 nM for serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake inhibition.

"I was diagnosed 10+ years ago and the first meds I was on worked great! Then they stopped being as effective, so it became years of upping doses and adding this med or taking away that one. I had a hard time keeping up.

I would do really well on whatever new combo for a while, then I would get complacent or wouldn’t see the changes I wanted and it became harder to take them every day. It wasn’t a conscious choice really I just have such intense fatigue I have to spend my energy on the top priority things. The meds would just sort of fall off that list. Then I’d go through withdrawals and feel even worse and it was harder to get back on them long enough to matter.

I’ve had multiple conversations with my psychiatrist about this and he just keeps saying “well you gotta take them every day.” I would ask him how I’ll know when my meds are working and he couldn’t give me an answer other than “if you have no negative side effects they’re working.” He’s been my psych since the beginning and still mispronounces my name half the time. I’ve tried to talk with his office about getting a referral for a new psych but it’s become such a stressor that now my avoidance has kicked in. I don’t know if I’ll go back or how long it will take me to start the exhausting process of finding a new one.

"I get some anhedonia in the mix with MDD. Earlier this year I got a doozy of an MDD and the anhedonia was tough.

Like one of the other posters mine responds to meds but I had to work out the new regimen as my old faithful had stopped working.

In terms of doing stuff towards managing it I used the pleasure I could recognise in others even if I couldn't feel it as a way of engaging.

So I'm a crafter. I made a very basic baby blanket and kept at it anticipating Mama's delight. With my sport, I kept at it as I knew my team mates enjoyed playing and having me in the team kept us in the competition.

Food and work were both tough. I usually get a lot of enjoyment from both. I had to eat to fuel my body and I spent my effort mechanising some routine tasks to lift the functional burden.

"In my case I dont have anything environmental causing it. I graduated long ago and don’t have current stressors. I had to come back home because of this issue.

As hard as it is to believe, my issue began overnight after a alcohol hangover where I drank too much. The hangover was also about 5 or so weeks after covid, tho I have no other LC symptoms. Over the next few days it was getting better but then suddenly having caffeine in a tea plunged me back into it. 

Things have fluctuated and I even tried Ketamine treatments but they made me more numb for a week. Lyrica is a med that actually helps me but cant be taken continuously. 

I was doing better for some time, had done a round of the nootropic MIF-1 back in April which helped. Then I got SNT TMS which helped but I still had lingering blunting couldnt feel excitement nostalgia and my sexual function also was like 0 still. So I decided to try MIF-1 again but now this time it totally crashed me I think. 

Also I don’t have a low motivation issue. My issue is specifically in emotional response and pleasure. I also don’t have other depression symptoms like low mood (my mood is normal), nor appetite and sleep issues. I do have anxiety as a result of my emotional blunting and anhedonic I keep worrying about it and cannot stop worrying when it’ll go away.

"Hey everyone, 

I ve been seeing a psychiatrist for the last two months. I told him that I need a med that will boost my energy and help with depression and anxiety but I won't tolerate neither any effects on libido nor weight gain. 

I ve tried too many meds and the best on for me was fluotetine by far. But it caused libido and sexual issues so I stopped after 2 years. 

I know that if a med causes either of these two sides even if take it to get better sooner or later I ll stop it. So there is no point in starting it in the first place. My condition is chronic so it's not like I ll take the med for a while and then stop. 

Anyway so the doc prescribed trintellix which I ve taken in the past and although it didn't cause libido or weight gain issues it didn't help at all and made me more angry. The doc insisted that it's not from trintellix and he said to take it at 10mg along with 5mg aripiprazole. 

I read about aripiprazole increasing appetite and weight so I didn't take it. Took trintellix for 2 weeks and after experiencing all the symptoms that made me stop it earlier I stopped it (I had taken trintellix previously for 8 months and those sides didn't get better) 

So I went to the doc again yesterday and he got mad that I didn't take them and said things like you don't think I know these meds and how they work etc and also that there is no possibility that 5mg of aripiprazole will cause appetite increase or weight gain. 

I thought that ok he is a doctor (and considered a good one) so if he is so sure I might give it a try. 

First day today I took the meds in the morning and even though I ate lunch one hour later I was hungry again, I held myself but at two hours I ate another snack. I am feeling more hungry, so what do I do? Give it time? Will that subside? 

What do you guys think?"	SnooHamsters2717	post	40.83242635525461	female	White	0.997717022895813	na	na	na	7	depressionregimens
I have been on abilify for years. If he is saying it won't cause weight gain at 5 mg, you need a new doctor. It caused weight gain for me at 2, 5, and 10 mg. It works so well for me, though. So, I have to be very strict about my calorie intake and exercise every day just to not gain weight. Losing weight on abilify is incredibly difficult. But, it's a game-changer for me, so I tolerate it. I usually take 5 or 2 mg depending on how I am doing. Best to you.

"It seems like Aripiprazole is the only drug you haven't taken for an extended period of time. Give your body some time to adjust to it, one day really isn't a good sample size.

"About the adjusting yeah I agree but is increased appetite something that gets better with time? Or do you have it (if you are one of the unlucky ones who get it) for as long as you take the med. 

How to manage them? There is no management. You just accept it, but I am not willing to do that. For fluoxetine sexual sides I tried every possible add on or dose adjustment there is. 

I am actually disappointed with this doc and most psychatrists I ve met. It's like they are thinking that weight gain or libido aren't as important as mental health. To me they are, and I should be the one to make the choice if I want to accept that or not don't you think? By knowing the truth about the sides


With this appetite increase its not like I can't force myself not to eat, but that's a torture, not a helping med. 

There is a reason I try all these meds. I ve gained weight from meds before and I ve had no libido from ssri. I was on fluoxetine for 2 years (low libido on it) and on remeron for another 2(weight gain). 

Life is worse with either low libido or weight gain and with the benefits of the med compared to not take anything (both situations suck though)."	SnooHamsters2717	follow-up	na	na	na	0.997717022895813	weak	no	strong	na	depressionregimens
I wasn't warned about weight gain, so at first I just started constantly craving junk food and it was so hard not to give in. I normally eat a very healthy diet, but I went crazy all of a sudden for sweets and carbs. I noticed after about a month I gained around 15 lbs. I started being much more careful about my diet and started exercising. Continued to gain weight. Went to see a registered dietician and we were both getting frustrated because I was tracking every calorie and my weight would not budge even though I was at a 500 calorie deficit for my tdee. Anyway, it has taken a long time but I am finally starting to lose weight.  My rate of weight loss is much slower than that for the average person. We also found that by drastically increasing my protein the weight loss was finally triggered. Again, I don't knock it because it really works super well for me as an adjunct to my other medications. Like the other commenter said, there are trade offs. If you start out informed and pay attention to diet and exercise, you might mitigate the negative effects.

It definitely sucks that meds that are supposed to help have side effects than can impact a person's life so much.

"I’ve been prescribed Prozac for almost 3 years, I feel like the first two years or so it did wonders for my mental health but recently it’s kind of been wearing off, so to speak or just not working as well when I first started. Ive been in a rut lately, not feeling all that great.

I’ve been talking to my doctor and we’ve discussed trying Wellbutrin but I’m a little apprehensive about trying something new and just getting accustomed to a new medication and everything that comes with that.

Like many people, I went through hell going on Sertraline 6 years ago. Once the side-effects left me, I didn't notice much until the last 2 years or so.

"Hi again.
I've been on aripiprazole for a little over a month now, bit my dose (2.5 mg) has been truly stable for the past 1.5-2 weeks. I've been experiencing muscle jerks here n there, but nothing where I felt like it was unbearable. Weirdly, if I rubbed my eye for too long the eyelid would twitch, but since it normally didn't last, I dismissed it. The jerks would get more frequent if caffeine was consumed.
Today, however, I am pretty sure I have experienced akathisia? I had an annoying tic in my heel every time I tried to rest and during the night it didn't stop. Also was rolling in my bed endlessly and felt restless in my legs. At a 2 hour mark, I measured my heart rate and it was up to 95 (I take aripiprazole at night, btw).
Only managed to fall asleep after an hour of taking gabapentin.

Should I be concerned? I could try to wait it out in case it's temporary or lower my dose back to 1.25 mg, although I am not sure if it would be enough for me."	Shroomyboyo	post	29.333298238844755	male	White	0.9978086352348328	na	na	na	4	depressionregimens

"One of the struggles with depression is getting enough nutrients or calories for a given day. I recently figured out a pretty straight forward meal anyone can eat day in and day out.

Bean Burrito. 3 Ingredients: Canned beans (any kind) Wheat Tortilla (watch the sodium usually get 12% DV others are much higher), fresh shredded cheese (buy it already shredded).

Directions: shredded cheese on tortilla on pan with low/medium heat wait till it melts (1-2 minutes), drain beans and microwave for 2:22, put beans on melted cheese eat. Total time including eating is like 10 minutes

I usually eat two of these then finish the beans. Meal is about 800 calories so you're set for about half or a third of your caloric needs for the day. You can also add salsa and sour cream but I don't because so far I like to keep it simple to 3 ingredients.

I think this is infinitely healthier than fast food because here you're working with 3 ingredients and even something basic like a bean burrito at any fast food place has many many ingredients as well as tons of sodium.

Adding another — three words: mashed potato flakes.

They’re extremely inexpensive, endlessly shelf-stable, and come together with just boiling water, salt, and fat/cheese of your choice. Stir the freeze dried potatoes into boiling water + whatever in literally two minutes if that’s all you can muster. If you want to be a little better to your body, add some microwave-steamed frozen mixed veg and some air-fryer or microwave (vegan in my case) chicken nuggets. I call it “sad potatoes” or “KFC bowl.” With veg + protein, comes out to about $1.50/serving and ~10 min prep time.

Like how do people keep going trying treatment after treatment? The nature of my depression is that it is really quite severe and I have really low energy, no motivation, hopeless. Doesn't the nature of depression make it so hard to continue to pursue treatment? And the fact that trying a new treatment could make your depression worse perhaps even causing suicide?

"Sometimes I'm trying for the little hope it gives me 'maybe this time it will help"". Sometimes I don't try at all and I'm just existing waiting for nothing, going through torture without end. Sometimes my heart breaks everyday that I'm not able to live normally, not able to live at all.
Mostly my severity of depression is unbearable. I'm more scared of staying like this than of giving my all energy that has left to try one more time. 
I've got ECT this year for the second time and it didn't help this time at all. It only gave me more cognitive problems that I already had. 
Then I started snorting ketamine and there's no effect. But I'm so desperate and I lying to myself 'maybe next dose will change sth, or maybe my dose is not enough maybe if I take more sth will finally change' but most of the time I don't believe ANYTHING can help me ever and I'm not able to survive even one more day.
My boyfriend proposed to rent a room in a hotel to try bigger dose of ketamine so I could feel comfortable there and won't be by myself. But I'm not optimistic at all. All I think is it's waste of time, money, energy and huge disappointment at the end.
Meds helped me A LOT when I first tried them so I thought years later than maybe they can help me once again when I find the right ones.

Yes the nature of depression does make it difficult if not impossible to keep pursuing options. I’ve canceled many of my appointment and done many of my appointments over zoom. In fact, there would be days that I wouldn’t shower, but right before the appointment I would force myself to so I could look half-way presentable. Sometimes, that was all I would accomplish in a week other than cooking and doing a little bit of cleanup around the house. There were so many times that I wanted to give up seeking new treatments and vocalized this to my doctor, but she would say “well, we haven’t tried this option, yet.” She told me not to give up and not feel hopeless.

You should try cutting out the internet . Honestly this is a big energy drain, full of fake emotions and manipulation and loneliness.

I had to give myself permission not to try anything for a while. Eventually I went back into therapy and it's helping. I do think that if you feel safe doing so, it can sometimes be helpful to just rawdog the depression for a while IF you do it with a deliberate intent to observe your thoughts and moods and find patterns in them. I think one of the most important things about depression treatment is to figure out for yourself, individually apart from your care providers, how much to expect the meds to do for you vs. how much you should expect to get out of things like CBT, lifestyle changes, and self-discovery/self-acceptance. And I think sometimes just getting off the med carousel for a little bit - again, if you can do so safely - can help you do that.	everydaynoodles	reply	na	na	na	0.9961835741996765	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

It's activating to a certain extend and elevates my anxiety. I still have bad times because of PTSD triggers which lead to anhedonia and depression but my overall well-being has increased tremendously.
I can feel deep sadness as well as happiness and hope instead of just being numb. I even started making long-term life goals.

I've had weird blurry vision the first half year of taking it but that was the only side effect paired with a night of insomnia every 3-4 weeks.

I think it's a good decision made by your psychiatrist since it's a reversible maoi and therefore has no food interaction and a way milder side effect profile then TCAs for example while maintaining efficiency on a same level.

Hypertensive crisis is not a concern. Maybe do some research on the matter - there is a lot of well made study's to that medication.

In which way did they help you focus? Because for me it feels like my mind lacks arousal and even if I attempt to focus, I simply lose it. Not really sure whether that can be helped.	Dense-Account1577	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9983319640159607	no	strong	strong	na	depressionregimens
Stimulants mostly helps if I have specific tasks to do. It’s like they block out noise (intrusive thoughts, racing thoughts etc). Nortriptyline and duloxetine gave more of a drive to do things together with the needed focus. So they helped with the ability to do a task for a long time because I *wanted* to do it, whereas stims is more like you just do the task without really knowing why you do it (for me, it may be different for others)	Dense-Account1577	reply	na	na	na	0.9983319640159607	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"Been suffering from depression for I don't even know how long. I recently started getting better and I realised I don't remember feeling this content or happy. So I must've been like this for ages. You have no idea how world and perception changing it is for a person to experience this (*well many of you hopefully do*). To normal people I think, this is what all of you lucky fuckers have been feeling all this time? Not even, I'm still not out of it, so it only gets better.

A MAJOR cause of my improvemnt is cold water. I was numb, no feeling in my brain. Cold water hitting my skin shocks my brain. Gives it stimulation. Makes me feel. Gives me SENSATION. I feel ALIVE. I love the pain, any feeling, they are so tasteful and beautiful. No one but the Hitlers of the world should lose the ability to have them. Few months ago I would have never thought my routine would be so good. I was in bed 100% of the day, eating, thinkiing of sucide and slowly withering away. Now, I wake up at 5:30 am, get into a freezing cold shower. I jump right in, takes me a while to hype myself up for it, but I don't want to slowly get use to it, I want the cold shock and parts of my face going numb. Stay in for 10 minutes, then I go for a 30 min run. This entire period is my highlight of my day. It feels so good. I get pretty emotional sometimes. I think it's cuz I like feeling emotional after such a long period of numbness. I will sometimes scream or cry while running, it FEELS so good. Pretty sure my neighbors think I've gone coocoo. I can only do this cuz of the 10 min cold shower in the morning. I use it to snow ball. Upon waking, I feel dull, numb and lazy. Right after the shower, I feel energetic and happy. I use this to go on a run.Then some times I go for a hike as well. All of this gives me enough dopamine to last like half a day. Being happy for half a day is amazing improvement for me.

What about the other half? I now go to swim in a beach near by. I live in Ireland so all water here is really cold, even in summer. I love it. I'm getting so good at swimming as well. Either way, that gives me enough happiness to last the rest of the day. Imma keep this routine and hopefully keep building on it until I eventually get a job and start building a life for myself. I have 1 year to get better. I took a gap year from my course. I'm studing medicine and I now I cannot believe I managed to get and stay in it with how miserable I was. I'll actually be unstoppable in it when I'm healthy. I would like to dedicate half of this to cold water, 25% to my therapist and 25% to Sertraline. If you try this, make sure to use the happiness from the shower for exercise or something. Invest it, otherwise it fades in a few min or an hour at most.

I'm doing other similarly stimulating stuff like going for a deep hike alone in a forest, an exhausting climb on a mountain in the cold and windy rain.

"I can see why you would think that, I certainly gave that impression in my post, I was on a good day. I got diagnosed with moderate depression 3 months ago. This routine is the result of me working during those 3 months. I used alarms to wake up earlier and earlier until I got to 5:30am. I would barely excercise, but slowly made a routine of running and gym. First I missed many days, but now I do it everday. And I cry/scream more when I get emotional, not really excitement (unless I'm having a very good day). It's more like me thinking about how many years of my life I have wasted cuz of this condition. I like it tho cuz it's like a mixture of sadness and joy at the fact that I'm crawling my way out of this.

I just cannot understate how much me cold showering recently have helped with my mood tho. I had to force myself to do all that, it was miserable, I would still miss some days and just lie in bed all day. Now it's kinda enjoyable. I like it. I run for longer and easier after a cold shower. It sparks your body into an energetic state in the morning. Sets off a chain reaction of productive actions, instead of me deciding to not go on a run in the morning, and as a result not doing anything for the whole day.

*I have bipolar disorder, so I came across this topic in the context of bipolar depression. My subclinical hypothyroidism issues developed after starting Lithium. I was feeling better, but then began developing a lot of physical depression signs, which is what led my provider & I to explore this. I’ve been taking Cytomel (LT3) for over a month now and my symptoms have definitely improved. There’s some evidence to suggest people with bipolar do not covert LT3 to LT4 effectively which is why I’m on this instead of T4.

"For a long time, I tried hard to do some jogging just to treat my depression. It always comes with difficulty and pain.

I have been on anti depressants for 14 years now.

After feeling better for some reason I don't understand, two years ago, I was able to do 60min in the morning on a empty stomach, once every 3 days. I kept this routine for about 6 months.

Then depression came back, and I was not able to keep that routine.

So even though physical activity does help, it's not a silver bullet, and depression will still make physical activity quite painful to do, not because depression makes people sedentary, but because depression affect your nervous system, which in turn, affects physical fitness.

So again, beware of people advocating self help and ""just do it"" mentality. Do physical activity if you can, but always slow down if it's not comfortable.

I have a acquired a bad habit of reaching a pain level to be sure I was doing enough, but it's actually a bad thing to do.

"Awesome comment here and your P-doc is spot on.

I have gotten to a ""no prisoners"" stance if anyone pushes diet and or exercise as a ""cure"" for depression. It's a wellness agenda that is often identical to people who say if you are still depressed after prayer it's your fault for not believing enough. It's ableist and arrogant.

* it will make you feel more guilt because you think you don't have motivation, but depression actually affects your physical health, which is why physical activity is more difficult, independently of your sedentary lifestyle of physical fitness

* the result is that you force yourself you to do physical activity, which will both:
 * increase your tolerance to pain (that's not good), and also

"Hey!

Started moclobemide under a week ago (2x150 mg a day). I switched from 300 mg/d bupropion which was definitely an ok drug, it gave me energy to do stuff that in turn helped my mood. But I felt like it didn't really help my primary issue of anhedonia (I just don't have much interest or drive to do anything because nothing feels like anything) that much so I asked the Dr. for moclobemide because I don't want to use SSRIs/SNRIs or anything with sexual side effects since I have enough sexual/erectile dysfunction as it is. She wasn't really familiar with it at all but thankfully was willing to prescribe it to me.

Well last week I thought the moclobemide is doing absolutely nothing or just giving me about exactly the same amount of energy/effect as the bupropion. I did start to have this ""heartburn"" (I don't get any burning feeling so heartburn for me just feels like slight nausea) but that is not unheard of for me and I didn't immediately connect it to the moclobemide... But I then dramatically reduced my coffee intake and bought some pantoprazole that I occasionally (successfully) use for heartburn. Well the slight nausea has not gone anywhere or responded at all to these measures so now I'm absolutely certain it is from the moclobemide. I've thus eaten very poorly (not an issue for me usually) and lost quite a bit of weight even in under a week. Short term this is mostly a good thing because I can stand to lose quite a lot of weight and the nausea is just annoying but not too bad. I've also had some diarrhea which might be from the moclobemide OR just from eating quite little.

Other than that the only other side effect is this slight feeling of weakness in my legs. Hard to explain but kinda feels like my legs would shake easily when I do anything. But my actual leg strength seems fine based on my gym performance.

As for positive effects I initially thought its not doing much or is doing about exactly same as the bupropion. But especially the past two days have been great. Today when I woke up I felt kinda blaah (might be related to my sleep apnea, I'm waiting for a CPAP device now, I'm hoping this might be the core reason for my depression) which for me usually means the whole day is going to be like this. Took my moclobemide, did my morning routine and started feeling quite energized and good! Then later on I left for the gym and I was feeling so good with the sun shining and listening to some good music I couldn't help but smile! When driving to the gym I almost cried cause I was feeling good and hopeful cause then I really realized the medication is definitely doing something! I've also been very talkative with my friends and messaging them a lot. I also noticed I've been feeling more horny and even felt like I might have a spontaneous erection (which I NEVER have, other than morning wood rarely). Sexually bupropion didn't seem to do that much, I might have had a bit better libido. It however DID reduce my erectile function a bit which it ""supposedly"" doesn't do.

But anyway, I'm interested to hear other peoples experiences especially from this induction phase and the related side effects and how long did it take for them to go away? From skimming some studies seems nausea is a common side effect but the initial side effects tend to go away in a couple of weeks? Short term I'm ""fine"" with the nausea, it is not so bad but I need to start eating properly at some point...

Edit: Also interested if someone has ideas if there is some antiemetic or something I could ask my doctor for that I can take with the moclobemide? Not super hopeful about this, I have the vague impression they are all some antihistamines or something which tend to have other side effects like drowsiness or something which I don't want since the nausea is not too bad..."	szxdfgzxcv	post	22.41810465131812	male	White	0.0022336989641189575	na	na	na	25	depressionregimens

Coincidentally or not my testosterone levels doubled during moclobemide compared to before. This hasn't happened in any blood tests over the years. I think this is the reason why moclobemide worked for me. Pure speculation though. 

But I suggest don't take my comment or any other comment here too much to heart. Anecdotal evidence is not representative and tends to be biased as those who have experienced remission in some form tend to move on. Focus on Google scholar IMO.

"I’m diagnosed with bipolar, ADHD, PTSD, and in the past struggled with OCD as well. I’m relatively stable with cariprazine, venlafaxine, and lisdexamfetamine, and also take ashwagandha, omega-3s, and multivitamins. rTMS got rid of almost all of my OCD symptoms so that’s no longer really an issue.

However, I still have persistent dissociation that gets worse at times, and I can be triggered into worse depersonalisation and derealisation. But the baseline of dissociation almost never seems to go away. I’ve felt distant and detached most of the past 8 years with only moments or maximum days of feeling present with little dissociation. It’s been exhausting and I feel like I’m running out of options what to try next.

Lithium never worked for my mood swings, I continued to rapid cycle on it. Antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, sulpiride, perphenazine) with the exception of cariprazine always made me feel even more dissociated and had really difficult cognitive side effects. Antidepressants (sertraline, paroxetine, clomipramine, amitriptyline, mirtazapine, mianserin, moclobemide, vortioxetine), some helped with my mood, some did nothing, but no effect on dissociation. I’ve found venlafaxine the best for my mood with least side effects. Methylphenidate seemed to make dissociation worse while lisdexamfetamine helps a bit, likely indirectly through improved concentrations and ability to manage my life. Buspirone didn’t do anything while pregabalin was helpful but I build tolerance to it quite rapidly. Oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine, and topiramate made dissociation much worse. Lamotrigine helped a bit but not enough to make up for the cognitive side effects. Ketamine helped a bit but I cannot get it where I am without doing ECT and I’m leaving ECT as the last last last choice. Psilocybin helped a lot the first few times but then I started getting bad trips always on it, also tried microdosing but that didn’t do anything. rTMS did nothing for dissociation. I’ve done CBT, EMDR, integrated, hypnosis, acceptance and commitment, and schema therapies. EMDR and schema therapies have helped a lot, but it feels like over the past 1.5 years I’ve stopped making progress. Internal family systems therapy has been helpful but my insurance does not cover it and cannot afford to pay for it, so have been studying it from self-help books. I’ve started to meditate daily (now for a couple of months) but so far have gotten limited benefit. 

I’ve had extensive blood work done and everything is normal. I had an MRI and nothing seems to be wrong with my brain structurally. I go on walks every day and eat healthy these days.

I went back to university and am graduating soon with great results, have been working periodically. I have bad periods now and then but generally seem to be quite high functioning these days. On paper, I seem to be doing really well (at least compared to how it was four/five years ago). But this dissociation just makes everything feel so meaningless and I feel like watching myself go through life most of the time. I find it difficult to connect with people, seeing your surroundings, and not always being in this haze.

Has anyone found something that works for their persistent dissociation? Decided to post here and see if there was something I had not tried yet."	Jumpy_Let_8581	post	25.662072299032683	female	White	0.9694867134094238	na	na	na	2	depressionregimens

"FYI - therapy bias, not the talking kind

The only way I've been able to make progress was by getting treated for ADHD (which I didn't know I had most of my life) and working thru some really intense EMDR supplemented by IFS (Internal Family System).

And... this may be a bunch of horseshit for you, which is fine. I was so desperate a couple of years ago that it was one of the few options I had left before people were going to actually start intervening. So, take whatever resonates for you.

........

I find that when you're done figuring out your narrative, are able to make changes, and can recognize most of the patterns from talk therapy, it is time to move toward the modalities that force you to feel thru the rest of it, emotionally and somatically.

I like to think of it as an upside-down down rollercoaster - start at talk therapy, move down toward emotional (to process through the talk) then down to somatic/body, back up to emotional (to process through the somatic) and then re-engage with talk therapy. It's definitely an oversimplification, but it helps me understand why most people get stuck on the first part... they aren't willing to or don't know they have to look over the edge to go deeper before coming up and out the other side.

The stuff you're listing out... panic attacks, loneliness, emptiness, and suicidality are really intense feelings that (at least in my case) have shown to be coverups for more distressing feelings underneath - (didn't know that was even possible, but apparently those specific feelings are very good at numbing us and forcing us to ""look over here"" instead of ""over there"" where it's actually more painful.) In my case, I have to remember it from a kid's point of view or a PTSD state of mind because usually, in session, I'm like, WTF that's stupid.

I went thru years of talk therapy retelling my stories but not actually feeling through them to complete the emotional or bodily processing of the things that happened to me. (In theory, these processes can get interrupted and then get put into storage, somewhere in the body or on loop in the brain.) EMDR has helped me complete many of those unfinished processes, reluctantly of course.

Alternatively, people don't always need others to be with them thru this part unless they need someone to bear witness to it. Some can use intentional journalling, others can listen to music and truly vibe with it to feel thru things, others can use art or meditation to sit with whatever comes up. Some can use somatic techniques to shake things loose, so to speak. And others can just ""talk it out"" and feel thru the moment with someone else. It's all depends on what type of connection you or your body is looking for.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that these types of medications won't take it away like an antibiotic gets rid of something. It hopefully gets you to the point where you can do the work to maybe rewire your own brain to feel better or get you thru a finite time. Looks like you've made so much progress physically and understand what's going on mentally, but you are still stuck. If meds, nutrition, sleep, exercise, stable hormones, meditation, and supplements aren't working either... to me, that leaves the emotional work."	comfyhoody	reply	na	na	na	0.9848567247390747	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

Not saying this is your issue, but sometimes  ADHD or autism can fly wayyy under the radar and go undiagnosed well into adulthood. This happened to me even though I'd seen a bunch of therapists and shrinks over the years. Gender dysphoria can do this as well.

I suffer from treatment resistant depression. I have been on more than a dozen antidepressants (tried every class of medication) in the last 3 years and none of them have provided relief.

"Hey, Reddit community!  
I'm hoping to get some guidance regarding my experience with Anafranil (clomipramine). I've been taking a daily dose of 37.5mg for the past 16 days, but unfortunately, I haven't noticed any significant effects yet. I'm a bit torn between waiting it out or considering upping the dosage, and I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences.  
To provide some context, I started taking Anafranil to address certain mental health concerns. I had high hopes for the medication based on positive reviews and recommendations from others, but so far, I haven't experienced any noticeable changes in my mood or overall well-being.  
I understand that antidepressants and other psychiatric medications can take time to build up in the system and produce noticeable effects. However, I'm beginning to wonder if 16 days is sufficient to determine whether Anafranil is working for me. Some people say it took them weeks or even months to feel the full benefits, while others noticed improvements sooner.  
Should I give Anafranil more time to work its magic, or is it worth discussing a potential dosage increase with my doctor? I'm aware that altering medication dosage should only be done under medical supervision, but I'm genuinely curious about your experiences and advice in similar situations.  
Of course, I plan to consult my doctor as well, but hearing from those who have been through similar experiences could provide valuable insights and help me make a more informed decision.  
So, if you've taken Anafranil or any other medication similar to it, I would greatly appreciate hearing about your experiences. Did you notice any changes within the first few weeks, or did it take longer for the effects to manifest? Have you ever needed a dosage adjustment to achieve the desired results? Any tips or suggestions would be highly appreciated.  
Thank you in advance for taking the time to read my post and share your thoughts. Your support means a lot, and I'm looking forward to hearing from you!"		post	33.262586755489224	male	White	0.007950038649141788	na	na	na	20	depressionregimens

I was suffering with acute, severe depression last year and was put on anafranil, my doc prescribed 2 x 75mg but, and I'm not sure about this, I felt there were side effects (high BP, insomnia, weight gain) so I stayed on 75mg. Definitely took a good 6 weeks til I actually felt better, so I think a) increase the dose and b) give it more time. 16 days isn't long enough to evaluate if its working or not.		reply	na	na	na	0.007950038649141788	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

I understand that the dosage may seem modest, but it's worth noting that even a small dose of 20mg of anafranil can effectively inhibit over 80% of sert. While we do have room to adjust the dosage, it might be premature to conclude that the current dose is ineffective. Personally, I haven't noticed any discernible effects from the medication yet. I'm uncertain whether I should anticipate gradual improvement at this stage, considering it has been over two weeks since I began taking it.		follow-up	na	na	na	0.007950038649141788	weak	no	no	na	depressionregimens

It never has an effect on my mood though. Just feels like artificial energy or it makes me sleepy or nothing. Caffeine’s effect on me seem to change based on my setting or what’s going on in my life that day. If I’m at the office, always sleepy. At home doing nothing, jittery the whole day. Out and about, short burst of energy then crash.

I may eventually try a topical nicotine experiment if/when I actually want to commit to a caffeine break. 


A few supplements you should consider supplementing with or while using caffeine:

Magnesium,
Theanine (balances out some of the negative side effects of caffeine,)
Lithium orotate (supposedly caffeine depletes this mineral in our system.)

"This has become one of the most bizarrely...good?...periods of my life thus far.

I am ""officially"" diagnosed with ""Recurrent major depression resistant to treatment"" and I've been on various antidepressants constantly for about 15 years.  About 6 months ago I started Auvelity.  Started feeling pretty good.  No discernible side effects.

In May, my pharmacy was having trouble restocking the Auvelity.  I don't know why.  I was off my Auvelity for like 3 days until they finally got their shipment or whatever.  And by the third day I felt...different.

I felt smarter.  More perceptive.  Confident.  Emotional.  Motivated.  I felt good in a way I've never felt at any other time in my adult life.  It's like a veil was lifted from my eyes.  It's like I'm a completely different person.

I knew this was just a reaction to the sudden discontinuation and then resumption of the drug I had been taking for months, but I still made the personal decision to reduce my daily dose of Auvelity from 2 pills to 1.  I saw my doc and they supported my decision, but still informed me I was almost certainly in a hypomanic state.

It's been a month since I lowered my dosage and I still feel (on average) pretty great.  In the back of my mind I worry that I'm in a *Flowers for Algernon*-type situation: as the hypomania wears off, the depression is going to come back with a vengeance.  

I will have received a taste of what it feels like to be ""normal"", only to be dragged sloooowly back into the abyss from whence I came.

Has anyone here experienced anything like this?  Should I be planning around losing all this wonderful motivation and energy?  I feel like I could live the rest of my life this way."	selzada	post	24.8796669085985	female	White	0.001325748162344098	na	na	na	2	depressionregimens

I think that with nmda antagonist therapy, the goal is to improve neuroplasticity so it makes sense that you are getting better. It’s interesting that this improvement came after reducing the dose. In ketamine therapy, improvement is sustained for a period of time before redosing is necessary. I don’t understand the dosing reasoning for auvelity, and I think it was researched and marketed in a way where dosing would be most simple for the consumer. Do what you feel works for you, consulting your doctor of course. I hope you are not hypomanic and that you are just doing well..	selzada	reply	na	na	na	0.001325748162344098	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens
Hey, i'm looking for some people's experiences with tapering off zoloft (NOT cold turkey, thank you though). I've been on 75 mg for about 3 years.  Never wanted to up my dose to 100 or onward as psychiatrist was suggesting for PTSD, as I really didn't like having no libido. So here I am. It's been about? Two months now? Maybe one and a half? That I've been tapering off 15 mg per week. Initially, had awful brain zaps, panic, couldn't sleep. That was just the first lowering of just 15 mg.  After each subsequent lowering, I have some insomnia (usually lasts 2-3 days, little to no sleep) but then I can sleep alright. I'll also have random weeping spells, panic spells, et cetera. Some of the weeping feels unending and gutted, some of it feels almost okay, hesitant to say cleansing (had cried a lot less on Zoloft/difficult to cry). Now I'm down to 25 mg and I am feeling so weird. Tingling in the back of my neck/head, headaches, confusion, really slowed cognitive function (I couldn't remember the order of the seasons, earlier - or I'll be doing something and then completely forget). It's really scary. Is this a part of going off Zoloft, and how long should this last? My mood has otherwise been alright. I've got more depressive symptoms and I'm definitely more anxious, but I can deal with that and make lifestyle changes once these physical symptoms clear up. I'm just scared they won't clear up. Especially the cognitive part!	Winter_Giraffe6584	post	24.25920294546656	female	White	0.9977051615715027	na	na	na	5	depressionregimens

Yes the brain fog was helped immensely while taking the Nortriptyline.  It took about 24 hours and my bad symptoms were reduced by 75%. One other affect of the Nortriptyline that is nice is that it increases the  amount of stage 3 sleep that you get and you wake up feeling very refreshed.  The bad thing is that it causes dry mouth/dry eyes and increases your appetite.	Winter_Giraffe6584	reply	na	na	na	0.9977051615715027	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
Oh that's good to hear! I'm trying to go med-free for awhile and see how I do, which is why I'm tapering off Zoloft. Were you on Nortriptyline just while tapering? I guess I'm looking for reasurance from folks that have tapered off Zoloft to stop meds for awhile that the side effects of withdrawal will go away eventually.

I actually switched to Prozac about halfway through my Zoloft taper and took it at full dosage until I started the Nortryptyline, and stopped the Prozac at the same time as starting the Nortryptyline.  The Prozac made my symptoms about 10% better, but the Nortryptyline made them 75% better.  Definitely seek out a qualified professional before trying this though!

For the last 3 years I've been dealing with the following symptoms:

1) Decreased sex drive. I no longer have an urge to have sex. I can no longer feel sexual attraction, sexual desire, sexual thoughts, etc.

2) Emotional Blunting/Anhedonia. My emotions have become severely blunted. I can't laugh like I used to. I can't really feel pleasure or joy. I can't feel adrenaline anymore and I no longer get the sensation of my heart beating out of my chest when I am in stressful situations.

3) Decreased appetite. I no longer feel hungry or have a desire to eat.

4) Brain Fog.

5) Muscle Tension/Aches.

6) Erectile Dysfunction.

These symptoms all began after an episode of sympathetic overdrive. I was dealing with intense and chronic stress, depression, and anxiety. My body and brain was constantly in fight or flight mode then all of a sudden everything just seemed to shut down and I've been left with these symptoms. It's like my body and brain couldn't take it anymore and it just shut down.

I've been trying to recover. I've been trying to reverse my symptoms. However I haven't really been successful. I've had my Hormones checked. I've had an MRI of my Brain and Pituitary. Tests come back normal and can't really pinpoint what is causing my symptoms.

At this point I have no diagnosis. Perhaps I am dealing with a form of Major Depression. However can Major Depression cause all of the symptoms I'm having?

"Maybe it's not just depression, I'm not a Dr, but it might be something else. 

I love cymbalta (Duloxetine), and Lexapro (esc.), But you've already been on both of those. 

I have ADHD and it is a lot of the loss of motivation.

Even with meds I know I personally still have to battle my depression, meds help, but it's not a perfect fix for me. 

I try to stretch if I can, shower almost every day, take Epson salt baths if my muscles hurt, Im trying to take better care of my appearance. Idk if other people do this, but I use ice packs a lot. Idk why but they help me not feel so numb/ stressed. I put a frozen eye mask thing on, an ice pack on my forehead, sometimes cheek bone, and behind my neck. Obviously make sure you don't ice burn yourself. I also use a heating pad on my back/legs. 

I try to walk, journal, listen to music I have different playlists for different moods/activities. I have a planner that I write down my accomplishments in each day. Like one day it could be showered, got car wash, cooked, texted a friend, another day it could be really productive/good or overall accomplishments. In that book I never write things I wish I did etc only things I did or things I'm grateful for. 

I'm a girl and I have PCOS too so I track my emotions on a period tracker app to see if I'm just feeling low because of my period etc. 

You should make sure your Dr checks other things, add/ADHD, low iron, etc that could be causing low energy. 

I also use a ""sad lamp"" thing I got off Amazon, try to sit outside, make myself hangout with friends, and try to paint/do other mindfulness stuff even if I'm not good at it.

"Hi. 

I’ve been trying to figure out my depression for the last 5 years. Like really trying to figure it out. I started with mindfulness meditation 20 minutes a day for like a year and a half. Then went on a plant based diet for a year and a half. Then I added exercise to the mix. I experimented with dozens of supplements and vitamins, scouring Google scholar and examine (back when it didn’t suck). Nothing worked. Or it worked for a while but then it all got bad again. 


My loved ones have asked me “what do you want? What does feeling better look like to you?”

I just want to not feel like I’m drowning. 

About a year ago I started trying different medications. I’ve tried everything but the MAOI’s and the tricyclics. I have developed this manic urge to feel better. I need to find the thing that pulls me out of this. 

I don’t know if I will ever get it right.


Edit: I’m trying strattera and my head is finally clear. I think I was on the wrong track with only trying to treat depression when I should have been trying to address my focus issues too. I hope this helps me. Don’t give up hope."		post	39.173079176886695	female	White	0.9894745349884033	na	na	na	37	depressionregimens

"I was extremely depressed and apathetic. I've tried a lot to get over it. 

This is one of the best top things to help me. It sounds so out there, but I was listening to YouTube and not paying attention when it started playing what turned out to be a chakra healing sound bath video. I had my earbuds on. I listened to it out of curiosity and it actually made me feel things. Esp when it reached the heart chakra it felt like a hard painful knot came unraveled. I felt better a lot better. I ended up listening to it daily for a few days. 

I still have low energy days and feel down but much less severely and more on the sad feels side. I feel much better mentally and less tired overall. I'm regaining interest in my previous activities and life again. 

I'm also working on my self talk. If I wouldn't say it to a good friend, I don't say it to myself. No name calling. No blaming. Limit the negativity as best as you can. No I'm always such a _____. Nope. It's okay, I messed up and I'm going to do better/learned what not to do and won't do it again .

"Regular ketamine trips with therapy immediately afterwards, and living in a positive environment are the keys to making that work. Otherwise it doesn't seem to do much. 

I'd also seriously considering VNS implant if you feel your illness is impairing function/pleasure too severely. Not an ideal option but better than living in daily Hell or purgatory.

I second seeking a second opinion on trauma. A lot of C-PTSD (different from regular PTSD) is misdiagnosed as other shit. I mean I've generally always known what was at the core of my ""shituation"" so to speak, but I part of it is physical disability which I hope to treat with VNS partly, based on extensive research.

I'd also give clomipramine and MAOIs a fair shake if you haven't. Be warned that the sides with the latter can outweigh the benefits for some (was the case for me).

I also second the hardcore exercising. Out relatively sedentary lifestyles are fucking atrocious for everything. But don't do repetitive manual labor for work though. That'll kill you a different way lol. Better to learn to live in the woods honestly.

Otherwise realize there may not be a magic potion (that we all deserve and that should theoretically exist). Some of it might be existential angst. I know current events and culture are worsening everything for me. So make small measurable changes everyday while you pursue the potion, or perhaps VNS (PM me for details).

"Hey!

Been on bupropion (300 mg a day) for about a year now and I've mostly liked it. It does give me this baseline energy that makes it easier to do stuff that in itself makes me feel better. It does have a negative effect on my quality of sleep (I sweat a lot and toss and turn and wake up often) but that hasn't been too bad. However I feel like it doesn't really directly help my anhedonia (my main depression symptom) that much so I suggested my doctor that I'd like to try out moclobemide to see if it feels any better. She said sure and now I have a prescription for that. 

However bupropion and MAOIs have cross-interactions and the doc didn't really say how long should I wait between the meds when swapping, other than don't take them the same day. How long do you think I should wait? I didn't take my bupropion today since I was sort of expecting this so it has been about 27 hours since I took any bupropion (not from the US so different brand names but I believe the ones I have are similar/same as the ""XL"" versions).

"I've been taking Wellbutrin XL (150mg) and Lexapro (15mg) for well over a year. Added the Wellbutrin because Lexapro was a lifesaver for my anxiety but it made me positively exhausted - like I needed 10-12 hours of sleep to not feel like a zombie. The Wellbutrin absolutely helped, but it wasn't perfect. 

The biggest issue I noticed was getting out of bed in the morning and getting my day started. I could snooze my alarm a dozen times, then lay in bed on my phone for hours not wanting to get moving, and I would consume more caffeine than anyone ought to when I did get up. 

I read somewhere, I believe in here, that Wellbutrin XL peaks in the blood serum about 7 hours after taking it - i.e. roughly after a full night's sleep. I swapped to taking my meds right before bed (literally keep them on my nightstand) and it has done a 180 on my exhaustion. I've actually gotten up on weekends because I was eager to do anything, rather than laying around. I'm also not getting the 3-4pm slump anymore, which used to be so bad I had to make sure not to drive during that time because I'd be drowsy.

My family always tries to tell me I need to get involved in things and get passionate about something to find happiness and I just feel like I’ve wasted years and I feel so shitty about myself. Am I a fucking loser?	makeitfake102	post	39.10887497937366	female	White	0.9989891648292542	na	na	na	2	depressionregimens
"No, living at home is an economic necessity for many people  now. 

As for getting a passion,  some people don't get big passions and instead need to think in terms of what they have the base ability for and work from there. 

My partner never had something he was passionate about  but he was a competent mathematician and so he studied that. Although he enjoyed a career in statistics he's now equally happy working the night shift in hospitality.

It sounds to me as if you are struggling to go to things like the gym or to other places where you could meet other people because you are down on yourself. It's hard to break that cycle and I can look from 30 years beyond that point and go ""it really can get better"".

Recently my partner and I have joined a MeetUp group that does a range of things but we go to the board games nights and have a total blast. Most of the other people are introverted and get that you might not be a neurotypical human, but the games (anything from Ludo to some complicated strategy games that I can't remember the names of) give you something to do around people.

There was a guy there who had a similar sense of humour to me and we were making musical references all night in responses to things in the game.

Am I passionate about board games? Nah, but I still enjoy spending time doing it.

We also ""set ourselves to succeed"" over being social with saying we will do something out with others once a month and if we do more often that is just a big win"	makeitfake102	reply	na	na	na	0.9989891648292542	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"Hi,

My provider recently prescribed armodafinil to help with energy and motivation. Not sure if I'm understand what to expect with this med.

It seems to work for many folks within a few hours. Contrarily, I've also read that it takes a week or longer to get past the side effects and really begin working well.

Although armodafinil isn't an AD, how close is it to the timing of say, an SSRI, to be effective?

Is there any additional benefit from continual use of armo, as opposed to taking it only as needed?"	Syswatch	post	37.89202509663843	male	White	0.007167504169046879	na	na	na	2	depressionregimens

"- Sertraline, I can go on and off. I find it's best for anxiety for me now.


- AVOIDING THE BAD ASPECTS OF SOCIAL MEDIA... I have severe body image issues so I refuse to engage with pictures and videos of stunning girls. Likewise if I am too jealous of a Facebook (my only social media rn) friend's lifestyle, I will unfollow them so I can't see their posts anymore and they can't pop up anymore to make me feel insecure or ruin my mood.


- getting into a lot of hobbies. I don't have much free time and don't practice some of these v often at all but I love reading, gaming, crochet, sewing, makeup, fashion, karate, yoga, swimming and cycling. Boredom is a huge feeder of depression for me so having a lot of options for things to do if I feel in a rut is great. Growing up my only hobbies were gaming and reading.


- exercising, I'm starting to enjoy moving my body and it really motivates me. I think there is a sport out there for everyone. I get excited imagining if I could be flexible and good at self defense. The groups I go to are also a great way to meet people. I'm someone who NEVER did sport as a kid and would always be laughed at by my peers and picked last for teams. As an adult I find it's way better and any groups you join likely won't be competitive.


- getting a full time job, I now have something to occupy my time regularly and every hour is rewarding even if it's tiring because I get money! lol


- cutting people who hurt me or damage my mental health out of my life and making **myself** the centre of my universe


I still don't have many friends (I have one person I hang out with regularly, who is a bit too clingy, and three coworker friends who live far away) and have bad body image issues but I'm doing really good and coping the best I can ✊️"	Little-Light-4745	reply	na	na	na	0.006762261968106031	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

It comes and goes. I've had many medication changes over the years. Currently feeling the best I've felt on mirtazapine at night and dexedrine and/or methylphenidate in the morning. Many SSRIs and SNRIs that I've tried gave me partial remission; they made me numb/anhedonic instead of depressed. Taking forever to reach climax or not reaching it at all wasn't okay with me either. Tricyclics were better IMO in terms of curtailing depression while still maintaining interest and motivation in life. I have MAOIs at the back of my mind in case mirtazapine ever stops working (please God no).	Little-Light-4745	reply	na	na	na	0.006762261968106031	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"For me, realizing I had ocd and was never treated for it. I'm in my 40s now and much of my life I was under the impression that my ruminations and endless thought loops were a symptom of depression because I felt so stuck. But actually the depression was when I lost all my strength from unintentionally encouraging and giving power to my ocd by continuing to engage with those thought in order to find a perfect solution.

I am still skeptical that I won't fall into a deep depression again. But I also learned in therapy that I have support now. 

I was always insecure because I always acted/reacted/behaved differently from my peers (later found out I'm autistic). So I would put on a mask of what I believed would be a generally likeable person. And when something goes wrong or I made a mistake and offended someone I would spiral into a long deep depression because I got it wrong. Then I would reevaluate everything I did that led up to what I did wrong and what I should have done differently and try again. Every time I got it wrong again the depression would last longer and be harder to recover from. 

Apparently this isn't normal to beat myself up so harshly because when I told my therapist I don't know if I can handle another cycle of deep depression she asked me if I'm worried I will make a mistake again because I'm not perfect and make someone mad? It sounded like she was mocking me but that was literally how I felt.. fast forward many many sessions and I learned I developed this people pleasing attitude as a coping mechanism due to growing up in an emotionally starved house.. so that was the only way I knew how to get people to notice or value me. This was then reinforced when I joined the military.. 🤷🏻

"Hello fellow lifers!  Clinical depression is a bitch. :)

Acceptance that I was always going to fall back into a depressive state was helpful. Instead of looking for a magic cure, I focused on understanding the cycle and managing my depressive moments instead.

I got diagnosed with a rare, extreme form of MTHFR and got on a high methylfolate dosage. Also got on Cymbalta, which helped manage a bunch of secondary afflictions, like my anxiety and impulsive anger. A combo of both meds obliterated my consistent brain-fog. Also taking Viibryd,  which helps get me up and moving when I fall into a depressive pit."	Little-Light-4745	reply	na	na	na	0.006762261968106031	weak	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
"There may be other underlying issues or undiagnosed disorders going on. In my case I wasn't dx or treated with OCD until my very late 30s. And I was dx with autism and ADHD years earlier but was never really given any guidance to deal with it and I didn't know what to ask or talk about in therapy because I didn't know there were specific therapists for the neurodivergent who can be much more helpful than a general family therapist. 

There really needs to be some standard flowchart for getting mental health support. Like when do you see a psychologist vs therapist vs psychiatrist, because when I started out on my mental health journey I had zero clue what I was doing other than I knew I was really messed up in the head and not coping with life at all. and after getting diagnosed ADHD or autism, I sort of really expected to be given a manual or brochure explaining how it affects my life and what to do next but I was pretty much just sent on my way to figure it out on my own."

There is also the rapid dissolving tablet form as used by Mindbloom, which I’m having success with. It comes from a compounding pharmacy.

There's evidence that the opioid receptor can act as a disinhibitor of other neurotransmitter release including dopamine. This may well be part of the MOA.

"Would your opinion not fall under this umbrella? I know you're a smart dude, but there's a little more beyond what you're saying.

I don't feel confident enough in any AI (or the data collation behind them) to gauge any real reliable interpretation of Tramadol's LT efficacy - much less its sustainability based on available prescription and supply. Maybe one day (but they'll be other pressing problems then).

I don't doubt opioidergic stimulators will be used as antidepressants in some capacity in the future considering how effective they are and these receptors are heavily involved in pleasure (I also wonder if there will be other neuromodulators that do so, or companies will just be selling full-dive VR). It's also tricky because KOR agonism results in disphoria. 

But regardless of efficacy, I don't think the pharmaceutical and legal climate has cooled enough for anyone to dependent on any amount of opioidergic-based medication - especially if they aren't directly getting it themselves. Stablon/tianeptine is increasingly being banned in US states, and the CDC/DEA/LE all still have hate boners for opioids/opiates, of any strength. Kratom is hard enough to protect (and even that has unknown health risks). I can't see any doctor prescribing tramadol consistently - definitely not methadone. Even outside the USA.

Even though it's a heavy choice and a real risk, I'd opt for VNS implant (may boost endorphins/reduce neuroinflammation) before anything opioidergic (if you already tried MAOIs). You don't wanna be in a situation where you're left without an Rx and are now dealing with agonizing withdrawal on top of depression - potentially fucking up whatever semblance of structure and QoL you've got left, which you've worked probably desperately for.

EDIT: full disclosure, I was totally on board with getting hooked on tramadol or something similar just to squeeze 10 more good years outta life then peacing out after my parents died. *Less* disclosure: I decided after some experimentation, introspection and cultural analysis, that I should reroll that idea 😂."

"Hi, my therapist said I need to join an IOP program because she is concerned about me and I need a higher level of care. 


Now I do not think I have bipolar disorder, however there is definitely a small chance that when I see a psychiatrist at the IOP program they will *think* that I do. 


Despite not believing I have it, I am desperate to get better so I don’t really care what the “diagnosis” they give is, I am willing to try a lot to get better. To me labels don’t really matter much.  


I took an antipsychotic 5 years ago and developed facial tics, thus, I am not willing to try other antipsychotics. 


I took Lamictal last year and it did not help, so I doubt this will be an option 

Currently take Viibryd and Welbutrin for the last 5 months - barely any sexual side effects 
though they aren’t helping much and I am still having some mood issues. I see a nurse practitioner, not a psychiatrist (not sure if relevant). 


—- 

I am extremely hesitant to try any medication that will affect my sexual abilities or possibly induce more tics, which from my understanding is practically all bipolar medications.

"FYI A1C is not how you measure insulin resistance because insulin resistance can be present for years before it begins to impact your blood sugar.

Once the insulin resistance begins to effect your A1C, you're already into prediabetic territory and it's much harder to fix.

IR is actually diagnosed by comparing the ratio of fasting glucose levels to fasting insulin levels using something called a HOMA-IR. Many PCPs do not know this. 

Source: I had all the IR symptoms, including skin discoloration, and was told by multiple physicians I didn't have IR cause my blood glucose levels were fine.

"The reason for my post is to attempt to find anyone who has used a specialty compounding pharmacy to fill a prescription from a psychiatrist for racemic ketamine nasal spray. I ask, because from what I have read, this seems to be potential avenue to obtain ketamine for treatement resistant depression.

For some background, I am highly treatment resistant and a genesight test confirmed that I am indeed a poor metabolizer of nearly all conventionalantidepressants from their respective drug classes. A few years ago, I was in such a desperate condition that I sought IV infusions of ketamine from a clinic which provided a 40 minute slow drip IV twice per week for three weeks to treat my major depressive disorder. The starting dose for infusions is .5 mg/kg, however, my body seems to have a naturally high tolerance for dissociatives and so this was quickly titrated up to 1.2 mg/kg, at which point I was finally able to have a full dissociative experience and gain the mood benefits that followed.

Unfortunately, these infusions are not covered by insurance and simply are financially unsustainable (costing between 400-600 dollars per session). Flash forward to present day and my mental health has really been suffering again, however, I now have different insurance and discovered that the administration of Spravato by a REMS clinic would be covered. At first I was excited because this meant that I could be treated with s-ketamine nasal spray without the burden of cost. 

According to the Spravato protocol, only 56 or 84mg sprays can be provided. The 56mg is used initially to ensure a normal response and then the dosage is increased to 84mg which is administered twice per week. There is no dosage adjustment for weight, for individual metabolism, or individual response. The REMS program is so tightly controlled that getting Spravato approved and then supplied to a certified clinic by a certified pharmacy is simply a logistical nightmare. But I digress.

Personally, at 84 I can very barely feel anything, and am not blinded to the experience, so I am acutely aware that I am not being provided a sufficient dosage. When considering my past response and the above average required dosage, and when you also apply the seemingly basic logic that individual metabolism and reaction to the drug will vary, it seems absurd to me that this is the ONLY dose that clinicians can use of Spravato to treat patients. The protocols, method of administration, and optimal dosing strategy for treating MDD with Ketamine is far from reached a consensus in academic and clinical communities. And although the science is still out, there is at least some evidence suggesting that antidepressant effects correlate with the strength of the experiential dissociation, potentially because this indicates that levels in the brain are sufficient to fully antagonize NMDA receptors, along with whatever other antidepressant mechanisms are simultaneously occuring. 

So now this brings me to my question about racemic nasal spray from a compounding pharmacy. From my understanding, a psychiatrist can prescribe it and a specialty pharmacy can compound it. From one specific website I found offering this, the prices were reasonable. Additionally, since it is racemic it is not controlled by a REMS program, can be taken at home, and there is more room for collaboratively determining the dosage and dosing schedule with the prescribing doctor. 

If there is anyone out there with experience going through this process who may be able to share some insight, tips, or resources, it would be greatly appreciated. Thankfully I have an amazing psychiatrist who is always willing to try anything that might work and was the one to refer to me the Spravato clinic. I'm not sure if he is aware of the possibility to prescribe a racemic spray, but if it is possible, I'm sure he would be willing to pursue the avenue as long as we can locate a compounding pharmacy to supply it.

"I was pretty worried about coming off of Parnate myself but I honestly had no real issues with it. All I noticed was the pervasive sleepiness going away.

Though, for context, when I came off Parnate I went down from from 50 to 30 all at once, then two weeks on 30, one week on 20 and one week on 10, then switched directly to moclobemide (which I had been on before Parnate) and stayed on that for a few months before deciding to go back to sertraline and just switched over to that after a 1 day washout. 

So the switch to moclobemide, being a reversible MAOI, probably eased the transition. Also, because I was never without an antidepressant in my system the whole time it might have been have been different if I had to do the whole 2-week irreversible MAOI washout. 

I’m doing pretty good now. Definitely not where I want to be but honestly so much better than I’ve been in the past.

"(Raises hand)

So at the beginning of the year I was dealing with leaving a job I loved because the management were gaslighting and bullying me.

B'cos I'm neurodivergent I've got long term issues about bullying and gaslighting that no amount of conventional therapy had ever made a dent in.

Anyhow I picked up on some of the tools after watching YouTube about Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and decided to use them (for information I have training in counseling skills and I'm a mental health first aider and have suicide prevention training, so I knew how to keep safe if things got hairy).

Several really full on sessions where I took myself into the spaces in my mind where the experiences lurked. 3 times I cried not like a grown up but like a kid does. Then it was like this wave of stillness descended

"One thing that can help is not running away or otherwise avoiding your emotions. Several years ago I'd always bottle up my emotions because I had shit to do, and told myself that I could just fall apart later when I was done with all of my shit. I'd avoid things like crying and try to distance myself from things that made me sad or uncomfortable. It turns out that there's a middle ground between emotional detachment and excessive rumination that can be much healthier to maintain than going to either extreme.

Processing emotions successfully isn't easy. But it starts with opening up little-by-little. Instead of treating my emotions as separate from me, I started treating them like they were a part of me. It sounds like common sense, but common sense isn't as common as you'd think. I let myself feel sad instead of holding it in. I stopped running away from uncomfortable situations and pain. I let myself cry when I feel like crying. Yes, it will hurt at first, but you will adapt to it over time."	borahae_artist	reply	na	na	na	0.998055100440979	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"Escitalopram - took for 11 months. At the beginning was ok, then great(2-3months), then half year later everything started to go down and it stopped working. I think had no side effects, well almost, cuz was extremely sweating at night and lost libido for the whole time. Mentally made me feel a bit better, but not for long and consistently. Started having huge anxiety and panic attacks. Numbness, emotionless and nightmares also followed.

Venlafaxin - took for 4 months. Mentally at the beginning it was horrendous(suicidal, wanted to harm myself), after few months it finally kicked in and i felt so peaceful and it was quiet in my head, calm, didn't feel depressed almost, no anxiety in my chest choking me, no panic attacks. Was actually quiet happy. But then side effects also kicked, and it was too much to endure it, it got only worse day by day - extreme nausea every day, headaches that turned into weekly migraines, extreme fast weight gain without eating much even, was forgetful, brain felt foggy, felt lost, no libido, night sweats, extremely numb and empty feeling. Dropped it, i felt miserable. Side effects overtook the good side of this drug.

Bupropion - 2 months. Nothing to say much, no side effects. It actually got rid of all the side effects i had from previous depressants, for that i alone felt so happy. But also didn't work for me at all mentally this time. Didn't help my anxiety, depression, non stop overthinking, it did absolutely nothing. It made everything actually 10x worse, even after upping the dose to 300mg. Extremely angry, irritated, violent, constantly pissed off like a bee, depressive, numb, empty, no energy or desire for anything at all, total anhedonia, just everything was bad. It was horrible, finally stopped it, don't wanna see that ever again and go through that especially, was the worst so far.

Tianeurax - and now today i was prescribed this, and im extremely scared because of the reviews i keep seeing.
What should i expect? Are all these opiod stuff i keep seeing are true? Any major side effects? What should i expect? To be honest this is so far, that I'm most scared to start taking.

"I’ve been on 20+ psych meds for depression/anxiety/mood disorders in general over the span of over a decade (30, female) and I’ve never responded well. This includes MAOIs (Nardil, Parnate and even the two combined), ketamine (infusions, nasal spray, and sublingual), stimulants (Concerta, Ritalin, Adderall, Vyvanse, Dexedrine, Modafinil, maybe others), pramipexole, different antipsychotic, many, many meds including all the standard first and second like treatments (SSRIs, SNRIs, Wellbutrin, tricyclics, etc.). 

Stablon, which is just a different brand name for tianeptine like Tianeurax, is the best medication for me personally. When you hear about the opioid abuse potential, this is WAY beyond the therapeutic dose of 12.5mg 3x daily of tianeptine sodium. People abusing tianeptine are buying powdered tianeptine sulfate and taking sometimes thousands of milligrams for what I hear is a shitty and fleeting high. It’s a shame because it’s a good medication for certain people. It was the first med that not only helped me but didn’t have ANY nasty side effects which I’m really prone to. 

I’d been prescribed buprenorphine for treatment resistant depression which is much more of a straight forward opioid. And even with that I never felt any euphoria or abuse potential. Tianeptine, when used as an antidepressant isn’t getting you high by any means. There isn’t euphoria. It has other mechanisms unrelated to the opioid system that are at play, namely it enhances the reuptake of serotonin whereas most antidepressant inhibit the reuptake. I truly feel that’s the mechanism that is working for me most. Don’t let misinformed people dissuade you from trying what is a very good medication with a very legitimate place in psychiatry."

"Alright you can put the brakes on a bit, its a tough road figuring this stuff out. 

What will help is to write out the drug mechanisms on a piece of paper along with any other drug targets you can find for anti-depressants. Some youtube videos and google searches will give you plenty of options. 

Tianeurax is good. I am actually surprised to see this. The Mu-Opioid receptor is an effective target for alleviating depression. Give this a go and see how you respond. Some people respond, some people don’t, but this is the most promising of the 4 you’ve tried. The only real concern I have is opioid receptor activity and testosterone production. It seems to suppress testosterone marginally, most notably in men. I would advise getting blood work done here regardless to measure a myriad of health markers relating to broad spectrum health. 

SSRIs and SNRIs can help some individuals and the reason they help is not always due to increasing serotonin or noradrenaline. They increase neurogenesis in the brain which is quite strongly linked with depressive symptoms, which is also one reason why vigorous exercise is a highly potent treatment. They also increase allopregnanolone which acts on GABA-A receptors which you can consider to be similar to alcohol. They also decrease inflammation in the brain, which may be causal in depression. 

Bupropion acts on Dopamine and Noradrenaline. However, the response varies dramatically in how people seem to respond. It appears to primarily increase Noradrenaline and Psychiatrists are not privy to this information yet. So we get experiences similar to yours quite often, and Psychiatrists will dismiss Dopamine as a target for treatment based on Bupropion response. I personally responded the same way as you did. 

The effects you described from the SSRI and SNRI seem to be that of Apathy caused by Serotonin’s inhibition of Dopamine. This is likely why Bupropion helped initially to reverse the negatives of the SSRI. 

All common reactions, your not going crazy, the fact that there are signs and symptoms to follow based on reactions from different meds is a good thing, and to top it off you have tried a variety of medications which makes it more likely that a doctor will listen to your suggestions. Your in a good position to move forward. 

So if I were in your shoes my plan would be something similar to the following:

- Exclude other possible causes by getting  comprehensive blood work. Look at everything, do some reading on this. The information provided by harm reduction platforms for anabolic steroids are quite good here as they should cover almost everything needed. White blood cell panel may be the only addition I would make. I would look into vitamin deficiencies here as well, most commonly B6, B9, B12, and Vit D. 

- Give Tianeptine a good go. Don’t let prior experiences influence your decisions with this medication. 

- Begin a rigorous training routine and improve your diet somewhat. Sometimes in order to fix a health related problem you need to behave in a manner that you would if the problem didn’t exist. First few weeks might suck, but the following should yield large improvements. 

- If Tianeptine does not follow through then look into other drug targets, of which there are plenty i.e. MAOIs, Low dose atypical antipsychotics, dopamine receptor agonists, afanils, stimulants, neurogenics, DXM, Gabaergics (be careful with these), theres loads. 

Form a theory, test it, move on down a list. I would hesitate to believe that there is nothing that can be done."	Special-Different	reply	na	na	na	0.9994072914123535	weak	no	no	na	depressionregimens

I've been on a lot of anti depressants over probably over a span of 15 years or so. I've been on ones that never worked, ones that worked and then stopped. Also in full disclosure I also have substance abuse disorder which made everything worse by trying to self medicate to feel better. Medication is largely trial and error and figuring out dosages.

"Of course! Sorry for the long-winded answer but I hate the reputation tianeptine gets and that it isn’t available as an antidepressant in most countries. I’m currently pregnant so I’ve gone off of it and even coming off of it was easy whereas most meds were a horror for me to withdraw form. I also feel like it did some lasting good to my head because I’ve felt mentally decent during my pregnancy and I was terrified of how I’d handle being unmediated.

I’ve always responded extremely poorly to medications that work on serotonin, specifically medications that increase your serotonin. They always make me depression way worse. So with tianeptine, the fact that it enhances serotonin reuptake is really unique and I feel that I really benefit from that. Of course, I don’t know for sure why it works for me but I’m just happy that it does.

"No problem, I was in a similar position myself, as are many on this sub. 

Being honest with you, I would personally steer away from SSRIs and SNRIs at this point. I am not saying that you won’t find one to be effective at treating your symptoms. I just don’t like the rollercoaster associated with them and potential changes that occur during that time, only because we know little about those changes and they take even more time to undo as you have experienced. 

If I had my preference I would have you try an MAOI. Use a reversible one if its available to assess response, then if its a positive response but you desire further effects then you can trial an irreversible inhibitor. Parnate and Nardil are the most effective anti-depressants, both are irreversible MAOIs. They can be side effect prone, it won’t be easy, but they’re far more effective than SSRIs and act potently on Dopamine. I personally can’t tolerate them due to low blood pressure. They were first designed as a blood pressure medication which seems to benefit most people but unfortunately not me. Your doctor may be against using these, in which this is often the case as psychiatry is trying to move away from them. You may need to change psychiatrists somewhere along the way or just discretely ask around with different doctors to see if they would take you on and be willing to trial your selected medication. Just be smart about how you proceed with psychiatrists, plan every move and conversation. 

As far as those test results. You should email your doctor now and ask for them. If they ask why then state you want to document all medical records yourself in case they are needed in the future. I would highly advise you do this with all medical results in the future. I have a file on my phone with all my testing in a single place. 

About the tests themselves. Look up yourself how to address each marker properly, and if there are any other tests that should be run along side it to get a complete picture. The most common example of where this is needed is with testosterone in men. Total testosterone is usually run on its own when generally assessing levels, however without free testosterone, SHBG, LH, FSH, and Estradiol, then a normal total testosterone may actually hide a deficiency as other variables are at play. The same trend happens with a few blood markers but that is most common. 

Yeah unfortunately with diet and exercise with depression, you cannot rely on motivation. You have to do it in spite of how you feel. One step at a time though, just concentrate on exercise, you can try some dietary changes in the future. 

Me personally, I never feel like I have a choice but to workout. My symptoms get so much worse if I don’t, so I have unintentionally conditioned a fear in me of not working out. Despite some days being incredibly anxious, depressed and fatigued, I still have to go to the gym or go on a run. When I was at my worst, this fear didn’t exist and I couldn’t motivate myself to go to workout either. As soon as I got a taste of a better life then that was it, gym and run 5-6 days a week regardless of the day I have had. I have grown to deeply enjoy it, but when all else fails I don’t do it because I want to, I do it because I have to."

"Hello,

I’m a 29yo Male with ADHD, PTSD and chronic insomnia. It wasn’t until maybe the last few years I started feeling depression and anxiety, and it’s been progressively getting worse as I get older. I’ve yet to be diagnosed with depression, nor have I had my hormones tested (recently). I do plan to have my testosterone looked at, since I have used PEDs in the past. However, the depression and anxiety have come on several years since I’ve taken any sort of hormone altering drugs, and there are other things indicating it is in fact NOT low-t. The symptoms have come on pretty rapidly over the last 2 years and each month seems harder than the last. I’m in general very active and motivated, but I’ve hit a point where I’m uninterested in the gym and having difficulty doing the bare minimum in life. I’ve tried experimenting with different supplements, some work briefly and some make things worse. I’m interested to see what maybe some of you might think I should try supplement wise before diving into trial and error with perceptions. I’m currently taking:

Vyvanse (ADHD)

Trazodone (insomnia and depression)

Ashwaganda

Fish oil

Ginseng

Ginkgo

Lions mane

Creatine

I’ve tried l-theanine in the past and it honestly made me feel a lot worse. Gave me anxiety and made concentrating near impossible. I tried several brands to see if one reacted better but no luck. Ashwaganda had me feeling really great for maybe 2-3 weeks when I was approaching 2 months of daily use, this has since worn off and I feel back to my base level. I do not take Vyvanse daily, and I’m taking a very low dose for my weight and for how long I’ve been taking it. I take Vyvanse on days that I know I will need to be concentrating more or when brain fog has totally blocked me from being human. I take trazodone at night, and it’s helped my sleep immensely. I was averaging around 2-4 hours a night for most my life and have been averaging 6-7 since being prescribed almost a year ago. I did notice that my depression has worsened since taking this, but I find it hard to believe that better sleep and something often used to treat depression would be the culprit (also considering nights that I can’t sleep, I feel even worse). Fish oil has zero effect on mood. Ginseng I’ve taken for years since I do not drink coffee or tea, it’s a more relaxed boost of energy/focus with a subtle boost to libido. No negative sides from ginseng. Ginkgo has no noticeable effects on me, just is often included in ginseng matrix’s. Lions mane helps with my ADHD, and some days I notice more of a cognitive boost than others. It took a while before I noticed any effects from it, but I am surprised at the clarity I can achieve without Vyvanse from just Ashwaganda and lions mane (some days, as I mentioned the effects vary from day to day). I take creatine because I’m a lifter, but I do notice a slight cognitive boost as well. I’ve seen people recommend saffron for depression, but what else? I’m trying to avoid taking everything under the sun, so I’m hoping there are people with similar situations who have found something notable. Is saffron usually stacked with something else? Is there something like say Alpha GPC that would make my current supplements/medications more effective? Happy to share any additional info needed to assess and will update as I find out more on my own end with doctors and testing."	boomoptumeric	post	36.355536189830495	male	White	0.002883364213630557	na	na	na	14	depressionregimens

It’s hard to imagine the Vyvanse suddenly is reacting poorly with me and causing depression after 20+ years of taking these medications. The general consensus across the board is that I should stop Ashwaganda specifically, and talk to my doctor. I’m going to do that and also get my hormones looked at.

Not all SSRIs are the same. That’s not true. They all have different quirks and binding affinities at different receptors. Sometimes changing the SSRI alone can make the difference. We’re all curious as to what it is so we can make a recommendation for something perhaps more stimulating.

They are still within date but considering it's been sitting in my cabinet through two hot summers I'm wondering if I would be better served buying a new bottle. One of them was from NOW and I forget the other manufacturer.

"Most CNS stimulants (ADHD meds etc) stimulate both the mind *and* the body.

The latter manifests as:

* Increased heart rate
* Increased BP
* Increased muscle tension

Are there any stimulant(s) out there that are psychologically ""active"" (in the sense of alleviating ADHD symptoms) but physically basically inert (or as ""inert"" as they can possibly be)?

I do very poorly with medications that increase the availability of serotonin. Those meds always make me worse. So tianeptine sort of does the opposite. And seriously, ZERO side effects. And I get horrible side effects from literally everything.

IT’s not scheduled in the US (not sure where you’re located) but you can buy name brand pills from online pharmacies. I’ve been using the Stablon brand which has been great for me.

Here’s a quick quote from the front page of google? “Tianeptine shows efficacy against serious depressive episodes (major depression), comparable to amitriptyline, imipramine and fluoxetine, but with significantly fewer side effects. It was shown to be more effective than maprotiline in a group of people with co-existing depression and anxiety.”

"I went through the darkest, deepest desperation from about 2-7 months, it was so Acute. You know when you physically stub your toe and the pain is so heightened and acute for about 15 seconds? Then you also know what it’s like to have these UNREAL emotional moments that are completely unbearable but they also tend to last for only 1-2 min max. I lived in that acuteness for weeks at a time. I remember calling both of my parents telling them that I’m not sure how much longer I can endure and hang on.

It was so pathetic, I’d just wail and cry and felt utterly hopeless until one day I literally yelled out to God “THIS CANT BE HOW ANYONES EXPECTED TO LIVE THROUGH- HELP ME”

And the one Monday morning I woke up and felt conscious in my body and my mind. I was no longer at the complete mercy of my mood, intrusive thoughts, or feelings. It was like my life during depression was a video game that I was existing in and had no agency, but then once it lifted a little bit then all of a sudden I was able to function better.

The key has been for me is to remind myself that I have a choice in every single brutal moment. When I’m overwhelmed with grief about the past or the future, I tell myself, “you can cry and drop into dark feelings about this and it would be completely valid, but what life do you want? Your grief is justified, but do you want to live a life where you were simply at the mercy of your circumstances?” The answer is usually no. So then comes the CHOICE. I see the reality of my situation, but what if I chose to believe that I deserve to experience joy? Doesn’t mean I will feel it right then and there, but it forced my brain not to accept the label of “sad”. It forces me to take the moment captive and CHOOSE my response. I could cry for 3 hours and hate myself, or I can push through the physical pain, and the emotional pain of inadequacy, and say out loud “ I AM JOYFUL. I have many friends. I have a life if influence. The burning  pain I’m feeling right now is directly burning a path for me to walk through to the other side of the field. I’m not religious, but the imagery of Moses being courageous and probably terrified, depressed, hopeless, inadequate as a leader but having to uphold the responsibilities of thousand of people he just lead away from their homes sticks with me. He had the enemy right behind him and an ocean in front of him. He was royally fucked and probably had every reason to accept that he was a failure. But then he called out to the creator (God, Buddha, self, universe, nature, love -whatever) asking for help, then made a fool of himself while thousands watched by walking up to the waters edge, and he put his staff into the water by faith alone. THE FUCKING SEA OPENED UP. Everyday, people are creating impossible pathways from the deepest despair. I have major depressive disorder and I hate what it’s stolen from my life, but I am now choosing to stop believing that it’s not forging a path through. We have wisdom and knowledge and peace that the happy-go-lucky people never will. And truth is just as important as grace. 

Just like you said, I can’t end my life to then traumatize my family and friends and never accomplish my purpose- I can’t knowingly hurt those I love. So then what? It’s my choice. Nelson Mandela could’ve just gotten out of jail to simply hide from people in the bush. He had every reason to feel cheated, inadequate, worthless, lost. But he chose to carry on and he legitimately changed the world.

I don’t have it figured out. In fact, today I’ve been scared that I’m getting sad and am overwhelmed by circumstances and feel totally inadequate, but I’ve now just spent 20 minutes writing this out instead of just scrolling and I’m feeling better already. The choice is ours. Giving up the expectation that it’s not going to hurt one day is key, but it’s also comforting that everyday gets easier if we believe it does.

HOPE.

I believe a lot of depression is body-based trauma and our brain is just not a match for that. The current focus on therapy is switching from mind based (CBT) to body-based somatic work. The idea is that if your nervous system is in a constant state of dysregulation, it's not possible to use your brain to get out of it. You need to work with the body. As far as how to do that exactly, I don't know. But I have been searching for therapists that do this type of therapy.

"If you find this type of body based therapy that works please post and let us all know. I agree with you btw. I feel that in many cases the brain / nervous system has just gone haywire for whatever reason, and becomes damaged with time. There is no amount of ‘reframing’ (CBT) that will fix the damage. Reframing absolutely helps people cope / accept the situation but it won’t fix the damage. (For instance why is psychotherapy not a fist line treatment for Parkinson’s or epilepsy? Well because we actually have medicines that can slow these diseases down. We don’t send the epileptic to a priest to him exorcised, and we don’t send them to a psychotherapist. we instead have treatments that control the seizures. I think once we have better treatments for depression we may look back at talk therapy and shake our heads. but I digress.)
I do believe that science may be getting closer to better treatments and maybe even reversals for depression and bipolar. Perhaps some day we will be able to totally reverse Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, epilepsy depression, bipolar etc. but until then I simply pray for better treatments for us all to be able to live with less pain, and thus to be able to manifest fuller richer lives, and to give more of ourselves (because we are less sick, or sick less often) and reach more of our potential."	ifeelyoubraaa	reply	na	na	na	0.00159079406876117	weak	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"Foreword: it seems both these medications, for the prescription of adjunctive treatment of Depression, are 100x more difficult to acquire in the UK than the USA. Ketamine you can literally mail order in USA; Buprenorphine I've heard from several acquaintances in the USA was prescribed to them no-problem by their own psychiatrist for off-label augmentation of Depression treatment.

\----

I have been fighting severe depression for over 15 years. Despairingly, I'm almost at the end of the road in terms of trying literally EVERY SINGLE TREATMENT OPTION KNOWN TO MAN. The only medication I have yet to try are the oldschool Irreversible MAOIs - but I'd prefer to leave these as an absolute last resort, given the huge risks if I don't watch my diet or whatever medications I may take in the future.

Before taking this absolute final solution, I'd first like to try my hardest to go on a trial of Buprenorphine or Ketamine, the only 2 drugs I've never tried that have shown to be very powerful solutions for otherwise Treatment-Resistant Depression.

Over the last 10 years, heaps of studies have shown Buprenorphine to be a very promising augmenting drug for Treatment-Resistant Depression. Several of my colleagues in the USA have even said it was ""the one thing that saved their life"".

As for Ketamine, there have been even more studies done showing its efficacy in treating Treatment-Resistant Depression (I'd estimate 4x as many studies compared to Buprenorphine).

\-----

Now here are the problems that I, as a UK resident, am facing in being able to get my private psychiatrist to legally prescribe me either of these controlled substances:

&#x200B;

1. BUPRENORPHINE

Although it is relatively cheap, can be used at home, and MUCH easier to get ahold of than Ketamine (at least in UK), here's the problem: there is next to ZERO data in UK guidelines or publications advocating the use of Buprenorphine in the adjunctive treatment of Depression at all, in spite of there being countless publications in the USA that clearly indicate its efficacy. So it's gonna be hard for my psychiatrist to legally justify prescribing this, per UK guidelines.

&#x200B;

2) KETAMINE

Ketamine - at present, there are 2 ways only to be administered Ketamine for Depression in UK. First one is the Esketamine nasal spray ""Spravato"" - a simple 4-week course of this alone would cost just under £2000. Madness. So that's out of the question. The second way is to attend one of a handful of specialist clinics (eg. Oxfordshire NHS Trust) where you have to be individually referred, even through your own private psychiatrist, whereby they start by giving you several administrations of IV Ketamine, before eventually moving on to maintenance with Oral Ketamine (given as an oral solution liquid).

\-> although the 2nd way of getting Ketamine in the UK is a damn sight more affordable than the Nasal Spray option, it is nonetheless still very expensive, and very time consuming (you have to travel all the way to their hospital to have each treatment administered, plus the wait time can be as long as 3 months).

Here's my thoughts: there are a load of official NHS documents proving that Oral Ketamine can in fact be prescribed to a patient from the very beginning (although for purposes NOT related to Depression). In conjunction with this, I have compiled a large list of studies which show that Oral Ketamine alone, in doses not exceeding 100mg, have been shown to be effective as a form of Ketamine administration for the specific treatment of Depression. Problem is: finding a way to get my psychiatrist to skip straight to prescribing me Oral Ketamine, without having to go through all the trouble of being referred to a specialist clinic and having to undergo a load of IV treatments first.

"I strongly advise NOT going on Buprenorphine for TRD! The Dr's  want you to stay on Bup for your whole life (for opioid-dependent patients). It's a last-ditch effort to not go through withdrawal & cravings.

 I've been on Bup for 10 years & hate it. It makes me feel devoid of a normal range of emotions & apathetic. It's a bitch to get off of too. I started at the max 32mg, then weaned myself down to 2mg. I can't get lower without severe withdrawal. Also, if you should ever experience acute pain, Dr's & pharmacists will deny you pain meds & even if you get them, the Buprenorphine will mostly block it. This just happened to me.

I too have TRD & have been receiving Spravato weekly for a year. It's awesome. A lot of trauma came up that I was able to finally address. Some days I'd feel so good that I'd be having a solo dance party or doing yoga. I also have chronic pain & on treatment days, I could move my limbs freely & stretch. The requirement for Spravato is that you've tried several antidepressants that haven't helped. 

Idk if requirements vary, but my Dr. says you have to take an antidepressant during Spravato treatment. He's been raving about a new drug called Auvelity. It's Wellbutrin (Bupropion) & dextromethorphan. Studies have shown that it can relieve symptoms within 1-2 weeks. I've talked with friends who said it worked. The drug's mechanism is compared to Spravato (esketamine). 

You could also look into TMS (Transmagnetic Stimulation), but I would highly suggest ketamine. I'm currently detoxing from Buprenorphine & it's been hell. Best of luck."	Responsible-Dish-977	reply	na	na	na	0.9894561171531677	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
I’m on the same timeline as you.  As few months ago I started ECT.  It saved my life but it doesn’t hold.  Ketamine doesn’t work.  Ayahuasca is the best antidepressant I’ve found, but is time consuming to take for me at the doses I need for it to be effective.  And motivation/drive and other symptoms were still not normal.  A month ago I discovered Buprenorphine.  It’s the only thing I can say truly works absolute fucking magic.  So I’m terrified of it.  I ran out and bought some Kratom, because at this point, I hate all synthetic substances, and it just didn’t compare.  I’ve done a ton of reading around the subject.  There are a lot of research papers, most in the past 4 years, to throw at your psych.  Bottom line, there’s no long term studies.  I’m scared to take this stuff daily for fear of tolerance, or adaptation, or whatever happens to the brain with extended opioid use.  But it works for now…. God bless you on your journey.

I was diagnosed with MDD when I was about 20 years old and now I'm 37. It has been quite a journey. I started out with talk therapy and anti depressants. Over the years I've been on different ones. Some never worked, some worked then stopped. I've mostly struggled with lack of energy, motivation and feeling worthless and suicidal. I also have substance abuse disorder as well. That started when I started self medicating. First with alcohol ( of course I still drank it while being on meds) and the prescription opioids and finally heroin. In 2013 ( while drunk) I tried to commit suicide and nearly succeeded. I was hospitalized for the 1st out of 3 times. I stopped drinking because it made me angry and violent. I stopped drinking then started abusing prescription painkillers ( Norco, Oxy, Opana). In the meantime over about a 4 year period I spent most of my time in bed (literally). I lived with my parents, didn't work, felt worthless. On and off medication sometimes because of choice sometimes because insurance. Went to rehab in 2016. Was sober for about 2 years then relapsed on heroin. Got addicted to that. Stopped taking my meds. Did that for 18 months. It got pretty awful. Finally got clean and sober again in 2019 and have remained that way for 4 years now. I'm on medications that work well. I've also done therapy one on one and group therapy.  I still have depressive episodes sometimes but I know what my triggers are and know how to prepare for them. I also know where my line is that I can't cross. I also know if I cross that line I'll need serious help like hospitalization. My medication works without numbing me out. I have a full time job, actually just got a new better paying job. I don't live with my parents anymore, I have a roommate. I also belong to a 12 step program so I have friends and a support system. I'm more stable than I've ever been. It has taken a long time and a lot of work. But today I can cope with life much better.

"I think it was triggered most likely by a lot of chronic stress during my 2021 covid year of school. It was hard for me to do e-learning and I procrastinated a lot. I didn’t really take care of my mental health and basically the build up of stress over time is what I think did it. I was also taking doxycycline antibiotics for acne for probably too long around this time, for about 4 months, a month break, then another month, but I don't know if that had anything to do with it or not. But I have been taking probiotics for a while.

So far I’ve been mainly dealing with this naturally, and have only tried a few supplements. Daily exercise (weights and running) and especially 15 mins of meditation have helped a lot with the stress/anxiety/ocd side of things. When my mental health was worse those things stuck out much more and were a lot more of a problem, now they are all much better. Overall my mental health is a lot better but I still feel “numb,” but not the super annoying physical numbness I have been feeling before. During the school year I was also seeing a therapist/counselor at my college, which also helped. Last year in the summer I was getting bad brain fog like every few days, now I only get it maybe like once a month, I feel a lot more clear headed now. But it is still hard to enjoy things again.

Every once in a while there will be a time when I get slightly excited/hyped about something and that will overall make me feel a lot better (still very far from normal though), and will cause other aspects of my life to improve as well, like sense of attraction. I will in general feel closer to normal, and quite a bit better than the status quo. But usually something will come up like stress or work or something that doesn’t let me really help the feeling grow. I’m really gonna try to do more enjoyable things that I have done before consistently and really try to get back into things I’ve loved doing. I have been trying for a while now but I really need to constantly stay at it. It really does seem like I have to train myself to enjoy things again, even though the conditions that put me here have been gone for a long time. So overall my mental health seems to have improved a lot, but there is still quite a bit of work to be done. Also, I know it seems counterintuitive, but dwelling and worrying about this less has also helped, like just thinking more about normal life things more than the numbness problems. I think that really helps decrease the stress overall making me less numb. I also pretty much do things with my friends as much as I did before, which helps me not worry about it all the time.

I just wanted to put this on here to show what has been helping me so far, if anyone has gone through anything similar, and was wondering if anyone had some advice on what to do onward. I took care of my stress and anxiety problems for the most part and still am, but it's just really hard to really consistently start enjoying things again."

"When you mention meditation and exercise helping with anxiety & OCD is that a separate symptom totally or you mean “OCD about the anhedonia” itself?

It’s hard for me to summarize everything we talked about but she recommended mindfulness practice, like being more attuned to your body and senses, and that could help get more in touch to your emotions.  She also told be to not be too obsessed with researching and looking into things, which honestly I agree.  In moderation it’s fine, but when I’ve become more obsessed with it and dwelling about it all the time I’ve felt a lot worse.

"I’ve been in most everything out there for depression and anxiety over the years. The one good thing I can say about Buspar is that I didn’t have horrible side effects and I tend to suffer greatly from any medication that effects serotonin (although I’m mostly referring to reuptake inhibitors). I found Buspar just didn’t help noticeably. It didn’t make me worse, which is a win on its own, but I never felt it truly helped. By the time I reached the higher doses, the drowsiness was too much of a downside to continue on. That said, some people respond very well to it so it’s worth a shot. 

Depending on where you live and how severe/what type of anxiety you have (social anxiety especially), Nardil (phenelzine) is the gold standard in my opinion. And I say that as someone who chose to discontinue it. I still think it’s the most effective for the most amount of people with the most drastic change in quality of life for those who respond to it (and it has much higher response rates than most meds). It will also definitely help you if you’re under weight. Buts it’s an MAOI and they are harder to get and need more monitoring. Although I believe their risks are generally exaggerated. r/MAOIs is a great sub if you’re interested in learning more. 

Obviously benzodiazepines are amazing in terms of actually working but they aren’t a long term solution by any means.

"Doctors seem to not believe Rexulti has a withdrawal syndrome, even though if you browse these forums you find countless accounts from people who have been on it long term having horrible, debilitating symptoms. My psychiatrist has said this, medical websites say this, basically the whole medical community, but this is not true. I saw someone say they felt like they permanently messed up their brain months after quitting (although they improved I believe). I tried to quit it once off of a low dose and the effects were horrible. Felt weird but acceptable for a few days, but then the side effects only increased with no signs of stopping over the next 2 weeks. It was hell, my brain just felt really messed up, couldn't do anything, movement disorder like stuff, muscles just felt bizarre, horribly dissociated. I had to start taking it again.

However, I know that it has had a dulling effect on my emotions and cognition and has put me even deeper into the horrible cognitive problems and worsened my condition. I already felt extremely dissociated, but now things are even less vivid. My idea is to quit it extremely slowly, maybe compound it in a liquid suspension.

Nothing like that. My mood just dropped significantly. I don’t tend to get too many symptoms like that. I did get brain zaps coming off a high dose of Effexor but that’s about it. I think I’ve been on it for 5 years or so. I’m going to try and lower the dose later this year. I think I’ll just halve it and wait and see how it goes. I’ll be more mindful of other symptoms though now.	The_Cabbage_Letters	reply	na	na	na	0.9992477893829346	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
"There is a publication but this summarizes it pretty well:

https://psychscenehub.com/psychinsights/antipsychotic-withdrawal-syndrome-tapering/

I definitely was not happy about tapering 2-5 years, I hope it’s faster but so far I tried to cross from olanzapine to Rexulti and now I’m on both because I just can’t seem to taper olanzapine faster than 10% a month. It doesn’t make sense since Rexulti should cover at least some of the withdrawal but so far no such luck."	The_Cabbage_Letters	reply	na	na	na	0.9992477893829346	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
Thanks for sharing that! Wait 2-5 years? Do you mean you're taking out 10% of your current dose at the start of each month and not going down by 10% of your original dose? Also how do you take it? Do you just have a dropper bottle of vodka that you squirt in your mouth every night?	The_Cabbage_Letters	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9992477893829346	no	no	strong	na	depressionregimens
"So I have an amber bottle, put the pill in and put 90 proof vodka in the bottle too. It dissolves at 1mg/ml so you have to dilute to 0.5mg/ml if you want it fully dissolved since it’s still only 45% ethanol. 

So I put 4ml of vodka into the bottle with 2mg tablet. Some people will make it more dilute to make it easier to taper since the hash marks on the syringes are really small. But I’m not tapering yet so haven’t done that. So for now, I take out 0.5ml using a syringe and that is 0.25mg. 10% is about 2.5 hash marks, kind of a pain but doable. 

And yeah, you taper 10% of last months’s dose rather than 10% of the start dose to create a hyperbolic tapering schedule. I think they say to taper to 1/40th of a therapeutic dose, but what does that mean? 1/40th of 0.25 or 4mg? So I figure I’ll just jump off when I get “low” maybe 0.01mg? 

Right now I’m using this method to taper olanzapine, which is an evil thing to taper. Once that’s done I’ll start on Rexulti. I had an unsuccessful crossover so now I have to taper both. 😭"	The_Cabbage_Letters	reply	na	na	na	0.9992477893829346	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

I'm sorry you're going through that. Did you feel like you were having side effects from the olanzapine?

"Hello,  
I was struggling with severe depression for DECADES.  
The game changer for me was VitaminD in pretty high doses.  
ZERO Sideeffects (as VitD can be produced by the body)  
ZERO Depression ;-)  
Here is, what I did:  
Got a blood sample (used home-test, verified by family doctor).  
Brought my blood level on a very high, but still ""green"" level (\~90ng/ml blood)  
This took some weeks to get there and to feel it. 

Test are free on the internet. (e.g. ceratest dot com)  
VitD is free over the counter. (recommend liquid, as Vit D needs fat to be consumable to the body, you might also take a pill with a slice of salami ;-)  
I always have a spare test at home.   
I have a returning appointment in my calendar all 3 month. ""TEST VitD""

(DISCLAIMER:  
This is my experience ""only"". Take care and time. Do multiple tests over time.  
Ramp up steady but slowly. An intoxination with VitD is possible!)

"My personal hypothesis is that there's internal mechanisms for suicidal thoughts (genetics, brain chemistry from genetics or epigenetics, and nutritional deficiencies exacerbated by long-term stress, often CPTSD related) and external mechanisms (job loss/economic stress, abusive adult relationships, personal loss, family stress, etc.)


I never really had suicidal ideation except perhaps the narcissistic teenage type of angst of ""they treated me poorly so I'm going to fantasize about making them sorry by me dying!"" However, losing my financial independence, and having to stay with q-anon parents and seeing how much they'd changed in their old age really fucked me up. So my suicidal ideation is, to my mind, externally based. What helped me may not help you. 


Kratom helped for a long time but I think I burned out my receptors leaning on it too much. 

Lithium orotate puts a brick wall between me and my suicidal ideation; even trying to force myself to think about suicide (to test it) had my brain kind of respond with *lol no.* Didn't make me not depressed because I was using it at higher doses than I think would represent what we would naturally get from good groundwater or soil content. But it did shut that down fairly well. At higher amounts it does blunt emotions for me, so the lows are less low and the highs are less high. But when you're desperate, I'd happily take that. 

Psilocybin does work for me for about ten to fourteen days after a 1-2gram dose. But the nausea makes me feel gross so I can't do it on a schedule (yes even with a Tek tea and even straining out the solids.)

Acetyl-l-carnitine is something new I'm messing with and worked within two days. Downside is it fucks with my sleep but I can take a day or two off and it doesn't seem to have the SI immediately pop back up. But I don't know where the tolerance is for me personally. I was so happy to find it (no, it didn't give me euphoria) that I had FOMO so I would take 1-2 grams a day and even sleep deprived it did help me do a bunch of stuff. But it's still early days. 


Slater star codex had a good blog post about Bibliotherapy that I would also recommend. And there are EMDR books out there to do self-practice on yourself with so long as you commit to being completely honest if your depression and SI is trauma based. 


It's not that I'm against suicide, because I'm not. I think people should try everything they can, but sometimes, be it shitty non responsive brain chemistry, or something like cancer or parkinson's where you don't want to draw it out til it's too late-- yeah, people should have euthanasia as an option and barring that, suicide. But I do think one really needs to commit to years and years of trying different stuff, changing life conditions, trying to plug nutritional holes, drugs both illegal and pharmaceutical, and therapy-- and then if it's just not working, well, why be miserable? Sure, life is short. But there's also something to be said for being excited to see what comes next, and accepting and being okay with the answer that that might be nothing."	sethfilia	reply	na	na	na	0.9945095181465149	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens

For me, after all the years since my childhood and trying so many things, “nutrition” is the absolute must to get checked out. Go to a “nutritionist” and get them to figure out where your imbalance is coming from. Your body, even at the smallest micro level is made of cells. All your cells need the correct amount of nutrients, in order to function correctly, it’s everything. Another prescription, is only a bandaid, for a moment, well for me it was anyways. Most meds, are just tricking the brain, rather than accessing the deep rooted cellular problem. I’m telling you, this change my life… the whole pharma system, is there to make money. Go with someone who understands the biological base of your body, and what is truly missing at a cellular level, for everything to be functioning and firing correctly and in balanced terms. than people who just read off behavioral patterns and diagnoses, just to hand over something else, it’s worse than a joke.

"I'm wondering if you have historic trauma that's driving the depression?  

Have you seen a therapist working with a trauma informed focus.

I have a similarly blessed life. 

I am currently working through the traumatic impact of being bullied through childhood and adolescence because I'm disabled. I then compounded the trauma by ending up in an abusive relationship.

My last MDD was probably hormonally triggered but it drove me to look at how I had papered over the cracks when it came to dealing with the distress around people acting unfairly to me.

I didn't stop with the suicidal ideation or start recovering from anhedonia until I actually started grieving about harm inflicted on me as a child.

Just today I had a deep conversation with the woman who was my ex's second ex. Initially she was all ""he's such a great person"" and I was willing to go with that and not be worried. But as we've talked more she revealed she got even more abuse than I did and confirmed with me he was grooming her from when she started working for him at 17.

I'm left feeling so calm and affirmed in my lived experience and I'm far more concerned for their kids than anything else.

"What you eat, is extremely important. But you can consume the right vitamins & and minerals in other forms. I was in adderall for a few years and settled with it. I got off of it completely from a high dose around 7-months ago. Where adderall absorbs/consumes large amounts of essential vitamins in the body, or any amount you have in the body, I went so much further down in depression. But I noticed, I had huge memory issues and a lot of brain fog. And I had to do something, or I was going to lose everything in my life. 

I started out with “L-Tyrosine” which is a compound directly related to your dopamine production. And can be consumed, but in very small quantities, in meat. I just buy it in capsule form. I literally, noticed a difference within my first dose of it (500mg) in 45-min..Felt a Glow, over come me, that I’ve never felt before, while it felt natural. Many people talk very highly about l-tyrosine, and some say they didn’t receive any benefits at all. But, with my level of depression, and where I’ve had it since I was just a few years old from my twin passing away, I felt a large benefit and consistently ever since.  And I still take it everyday. I did hit a plateau, but (3g) is perfect for me. It’s hard to explain, but the best side of you that wants to express itself, but always feels like it’s needs to be hidden from the world, came out for me with l-tyrosine, without forced effort. I felt more connected with myself, in a natural way. I didn’t care about holding personal grudges etc. i just wanted to talk and be positive, which was wild. I was in more control of my emotions, and thoughts right then, and more over time. ( I take 1.5G in the morning, and 1.5G at lunch or later on, it’s very safe, and those are low doses)

(B-Complex) works incredibly well with the l-tyrosine, while providing essential nutrients to your body for over all brain function & energy. (I take 1, in the morning) notices differences over time, but is essential in your routine. 

(NAC) incredible & powerful anti-oxidant, that has a very interesting way, of suppressing symptoms of OCD, within thoughts or habits. I take a small dose of (500g, at night, 2-hr before I take my sea-moss, as it can source out the sea moss and all other vitamins out of your system, if not taking at a schedule time before everything else) can notice effects in just 1-3 days, I think it’s fine at low doses, but others like higher than the bare minimum. I like being able to take it in long intervals, than short ones. As it cleans the mind & body on a cellular level, very well. 

(Irish sea-moss, with burdock root) Irish Sea moss alone, has 90 essential vitamins & minerals our bodies need. And our bodies (102) different vitamins & minerals. Which, Irish Sea mods covers very well. Quality of the sea moss is important on its potency. (I take 2000mg at night) I love it, and is a “huge” base for everything I take, to function properly, I experienced noticeable effects within the first 2-3 days, but the best benefits you notice in 2-3 weeks. You feel expansively, more balanced mentally, and you physically feel better and stronger.

Everyday is consistent, and my thoughts (affirmations and how you speak to yourself everyday, is extremely important) which helped a-lot as well. To where everything I was telling myself(positive affirmations) wasn’t just subjective words anymore, that I had to believe or program myself. But as if I absorbed everything, to where those words were there own energy, and I understood for the first time, that everything positive I would tell myself, was apart of me and ready to manifest. Hard to explain, but nutrition/ body must be in order, in order to follow what you want to do or be in life. Something I’ve always known in life, but I didn’t know it would be as simple as nutrition, as I’ve always be very athletic. I always was taught to believe medications was the key, which absolutely wasn’t for me. Also, I meditate, everyday with using different frequencies. You have to use headphones, for real results. Sleep so so important, I go to sleep with with meditation music going. You can find many on YouTube that are hours long. 420hz is a good frequency to start with."	sethfilia	reply	na	na	na	0.9945095181465149	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

Clinical depression is not triggered by experiences such as a job switch, familial loss, or lifestyle change. What you had described in your deleted comment is situational depression or an adjustment disorder. Of course, these changes can cause depression that may not respond to treatment or lifestyle changes and spiral into clinical depression.  But if you are seriously mentioning lifestyle changes to someone who has had clinical depression for 3 years and tried 10+ interventions, you likely don’t understand the difference.	sethfilia	reply	na	na	na	0.9945095181465149	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens

"Try a smaller dosage a take a higher quantity.  I need 120mg Fetzima.  It works well for me and has for many years.  A helpful non-chain pharmacist helped me by finding 40mg dosage that he distributed for 3 tablets a day to get the quantity of medicine for me.

I don't know why the pharmacist was able to get 40mg pills when the 120mg were not possible.  They may be a short time option if the manufacturer is going to continue making Fetzima.

Perhaps we all will have to switch to less effective or none effective medications given that for me Fetzima worked where others did not.

It would not surprise if:

* Fetzima works well and is perfect for a small amount of patients on which other medications do not work
* Insurance companies refuse to pay for expensive Fetzima when other medicines are cheaper
* Dwindling demand for Fetzima, because insurance will not pay for it, ensures that Fetzima can never be a successful generic drug
* Fetzima's manufacturer is stopping production to make another drug that they can make any money on or at least a little more than Fetzima.

Insurance is about the statistics.  If most people need a specific type of care, those few that need a different kind of care are de-prioritized or ignored."	mark4_9	reply	na	na	na	0.9978882670402527	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"Sexual side effects: ED, penis loss of sensation during intercourse, very delayed or in ability to orgasm.  On other meds orgasm was impossible for me.  Fetzima has the fewest sexual side effects for me.

Sleeping side effects: while not related to anxiety or depression, inability to fall asleep.  If I take 1 to 2 mg of Klonipin I get to sleep, but I am fuzzy the next morning.  Laying in bed from 11pm to 5am is frustrating.  Tradition solution, see first side effect, doesn’t work, also my wife thinks I’m just trying to get sex instead of help getting to sleep.

Most other effects from Paxil, Celexa, Effexor, Pristiq do not exist for me when on Fetzima.  Some if those were stomach upset, headaches, jjngly brain ( kind of a feeling like touching an ungrounded electrical wire jolting sensation but felling it inside my head - a consistent sensation with effexor).

Mania: while not interacting with other people in this side effect, I do think I’m solving difficult problems or writing movie scenes and music that is brilliant only to realize I wrote a mental store about a barbecue super hero with an amazing sauce that combined with an electrical accident developed burger super natural flipping powers used to stop crime."	mark4_9	reply	na	na	na	0.9978882670402527	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

Try gabapentin first, but it's absorptively a shitty drug, so you may need to jump up to Lyrica if you don't get benefits from a lower dose. 5-600 is a good max to try, and it has worse side effects for some people, so it's sort of just 'better by virtue of being worse,' i.e., thus easier to get off of."

And part of the problem was that the drop in hormones made Effexor a bit more unpredictable for me after more than 15 years of working fine.

The struggle is real. It’s been interesting (and sad of course) to watch my neurotypical friends experience real  depression for the first time in their Lives when hitting perimenopause. Most that have gone onto HRT, (the patch) have found tremendous relief, without the need for antidepressants. So, if we see depression as a very real symptom of menopause in the typical population, then, women who already experience mental health struggles earlier in their lives should be prepared for bumps in the road by their doctors as they near menopausal age, and also be encouraged to try HRT.

"You must be younger than me. I have had MDD most of my life. As I navigated the unstable world of finding competent practitioners, I was able to keep my hormones (and mood and physicality) under control with constant exercise, eating right, and good sleep. 

As I hit peri-menopause, around 1999-2000, I was in great shape, ballroom dancing 4 nights a week and happy. Unbeknownst to me, the Women's Health Initiative was brewing a flawed study of the effects of HRT on postmenopausal women. They concluded that it caused cancer. Their advertising must have been stellar because it sunk in the heads of male and female doctors and continues to affect our ability to get the product. 

Despite the fact that this study was debunked in 2009, it didn't get the press the initial announcement did. the prejudice against it was established and ingrained. In addition, the general ignorance of menopausal health care continues to plague those of us who seek wellness midlife and beyond. It is a known fact that medical schools devote 1 1/2 HOURS to the subject of menopause. 

Please visit r/menopause.  Get an eyefull of our struggles.

Back to my story. I finally found a stellar psychiatrist around 2004, when I was married and had a baby. Little did I know that my peri-menopause symptoms were doubled by many of the side effects of antidepressants.  

I had several gynos during that 15-year span. None of whom would address hormone treatment with me. ""OH, you don't need it, You are having a beautiful menopause,  and It's too late"" are some of the excuses that I received. 

If only I had HRT, I probably wouldn't have needed to take so many psych drugs, be hospitalized, and made to suffer through ECT 2x. 

I am now 65 and still trying to get my needs met. My newest GYN doctor is wonderful, BUT schedule staff stink. After the initial appointment that I waited months to get last October, I went for follow-up in January. Got to the office 5 minutes late, took them 20 to check me in, called me back, and said I have to wait due to tardiness. Ok, 2 hours later,  inquire. They said it could be another hour or reschedule.  I rescheduled.  I get an appointment ELEVEN weeks later. 12 hours before this appointment,  THEY CANCELED it. Said something about it being ""boxed."" I demand another appointment.  I go NEXT Friday. 

Meanwhile, I have vaginal atrophy by now, my husband wants sex, and am tearing and bleeding, which I told her at the start, but she had to rule out all kinds of other things first. 😡

OH, and after all that, my psychiatrist AND fabulous therapist BOTH retired within 12 months of each other.

"I'm in a slightly unique situation that my partner is a statistician and I'm a health professional so we looked at current research around mHRT and decided that on balance even with the original study you refer to I was better to be on it than deal with the potential risk from a long and colourful multiple generational mental health history.

My GP is also an example of universal healthcare at its best. He's got broad competent abilities around most ""day to day"" stuff and a willingness to listen then refer if things get weird.

He also is proactive in management and will even go off-licence. So my Mum in her 80s had a vaginal prolapse and he has helped her manage it successfully with vaginal estrogen pessaries which technically should not be started this late but have this last 8 years helped her avoid surgery and that's a good thing as she doesn't do well recovering after anaesthesia.

We had transitioned me to HRT from continuous OCP (which was a life saver as I get PMDD) at 50, knowing that my sisters both went into menopause over a full 18 months between 50 and 52. Thing was we now realise at the back of last year I went into full menopause in 6 weeks and the Effexor making me careless at my usual dose was a sign. Trying to take me down off and onto Wellbutrin (given it was the only other med that had any benefit for me that was available) was a mistake and my finding my blend of Effexor and Wellbutrin was a bit too much luck rather than good management.

After a successful move from oral estrogen to patches we are now moving me to a bio-identical progesterone.

My GP is due to retire and at the end of the last session I suggested that I be on the panel to interview his replacement. He laughed then said he'd put it to the partners because he knows my professional work and also knows that as an expert patient I would contribute a pretty valuable perspective.

I have on the record seen a psychiatrist once, to get Effexor many years ago. I was then referred into the public system for a review, got a young doctor doing his rotation through mental health and promptly ate him for breakfast when he demonstrated poor skills in listening (my GP laughed like anything when I told him and commented that would have been a great teaching video).

My gynaecology history was 3 different individuals with the last one competently diagnosing a bicornate uterus and managing a rather nasty cervical artery nick using something a midwife taught her. My only wish was I had known about my odd plumbing a bit earlier as I would have probably been taking iron pills more often.

I've only had two good therapists, none currently but my professional supervisor is a social worker and she knows my history and we check in on my ability to find perspective especially with trauma patients each month. 

I speak openly about disability, depression and menopause in my professional circles and point out misinformation on all three topics.

"I first took bupropion from Oct-dec 2021. Started on 150mg for about 4 weeks, bumped it up to 300mg in early November and went off it around christmas 2021 because it didn't seem to be helping much.

I remember it being a pretty low side effect, lowkey and \~somewhat\~ helpful med. The first week at 150 and at 300 each time, I would get a small but meaningful improvement in mood, energy, focus and enjoyment of everything else. Those tapered off into nothingness, with slight fatigue, poor sleep and maybe worse anhedonia starting around the 2nd week of 150 and 300, respectively. The long term effects seemed to me a mild anxiolytic effect and slight increase in general mental clarity; very little for anhedonia, motivation, and energy.

Today is day 8 and I've given bupropion 150 another go. same exact manufacturer.

I feel like shit. VERY tired, shit quality sleep, VERY restless and generally uncomfortable, unmotivated, lethargic, difficult to focus, and just mentally dead. Having trouble thinking of basic shit and following thru/completing tasks. anhedonia a lot worse. Took a lot of effort to even write this post. Crap mood and looking forward to nothing; hopeless.

What's changed is that I was super addicted to nicotine prior to starting wellbutrin, and am still currently vaping. I have also used phenibut/lyrica, kratom and adderall pretty heavily this year during college. Never was fully addicted to any of them though, maybe *mild* dependencies at kratom at certain points, but I don't believe I straight up withdrew from any of them.

I'm supposed to go on a big 2 week long vacation halfway around the world in 2 fucking days and I feel like garbage.

Should I stick to bupropion for now? anyone else had a similar shitty experience during the second go around? Thanks."	SpeedLimitsSuck89	post	29.979060747790744	male	White	0.9994794726371765	na	na	na	5	depressionregimens
"The NRI aspect of bupropion is going to have differential effects depending on what state your alpha1 post synaptic receptors are in. If they are upregulated then you are going to get these kind of effects. As you run it longer, they should downregulate due to increased NE in the synaptic cleft and normalise. 

If you can get your hands on ideally doxazosin/prazosin/clonidine and take a decent sized dose as a test, if bad feelings go away, it's that.

Just Google “correlation depression serotonin”. There’s many other studies and meta-analyses concluding the same thing.

And as somebody already said, serotonin serum levels are not indicative of serotonin activity in the brain so the answer to your question is no.

But yes, hypothetically if you had extremely low serotonin production in the brain or gut, for whatever reason, I’m sure it would have an impact on your mental health.

It's great that you've started therapy and lowered your dose of Cipralex, so you can feel more like yourself. However, feeling drained, tired, and sleepy all the time is not normal. It may be a side effect of Cipralex or a result of your new vitamin routine. I suggest talking to your doctor about your symptoms and discussing the possibility of trying a different medication or adjusting your current dose. In addition, focusing on a healthy diet and exercise routine can also boost your energy levels. I recommend trying to incorporate more whole foods and minimizing processed foods, as well as engaging in light exercise, such as taking a daily walk.

There are 2 ways to get ketamine for treatment of depression in UK:

1) Go to a special ""ketamine clinic"" where they inject you with the stuff. I don't know how many times per month is the typical number.

2) Esketamine nasal spray. I think you also need to go to a hospital to have this administered. And again, I don't know how many times per month is the typical dosing frequency.

"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta854/chapter/2-Information-about-esketamine suggests that it's £326 per 56 mg dose or £489 per 84 mg dose. 

Suggested dose seems to be 56 mg or 84 mg twice a week for 4 weeks, then once a week after that. So best case scenario you'd be looking at £2.6K for the first month and £1304 for subsequent months just for the medication.

The one place I could find that actually has full pricing is charging £400-500 for an intake session and then £650-1K per treatment https://londontmscentre.com/london-esketamine-clinic/, which would be £5.2K/month for the first month and then £2.6K/month after, and that's assuming you were on the lowest dose.

"I have a consultation with a clinic my psych referred me to and she suggested that I try to get a combination treatment of both spravato and TMS however insurance will only cover one at a time, I have fairly decent coverage (shout out to the sacrifice of salary as a state employee for good health benefits) I am trying to decide whether to try the spravato first since it’s shorter and less commitment and from what I’ve read can be a quicker way to get to remission of symptoms or to go with TMS first since it is “longer lasting”

I’ve been on 11 anti depressants since 2009 with some chunks of time with giving up on the medications and trying to do a alternative treatment option (yoga, exercise, mindfulness, journaling, vitamins, etc) and I just stopped taking Prozac after the worst 6 weeks of my life and I’m exhausted and just want to feel some sort of relief to motivate me and keep my journey to a balanced and healthy mind/life going forward. I am so tired of the side effects and the weight gain (which also doesn’t help with the depression) and time lost to trying medication after medication and adjusting doses and tapering off and dealing with brain zaps and withdrawal from one med to another I JUST WANT RELIEF, even if it’s only a brief period or a slight positive difference it would make the world of difference for me. 

I know everyone is different so I realize some people respond well to one vs the other but I am the person who wants to be as informed as possible when making a decision so I’d love to hear your advice if you’ve tried either and why you chose that option or both and which you did first/liked best

No advice here, but I just talked about these with my psychiatrist earlier today. She said in her experience spravato seems a little more effective generally.

"I'll tell you my experience. I had the Brainsway TMS treatments. It took about 4+ weeks until I started to feel any improvement. Then, I felt pretty normal for two weeks. TMS was finished and I considered going back to work. Then, I fell into depression again. About 6 months later, I started spravato. (It's pretty ridiculous how much the hospital charges my insurance for this treatment $7k per session, whereas TMS was about $1k.) It took me about 2 months to feel any improvement. I'm also on Zoloft 200mg. But, I've been doing pretty well since late February! I did 2x a week of spravato for first 8-10 weeks, then I went to once a week, and now I'm doing every other week. 
TMS was more painful like a woodpecker was knocking on my skull from the inside, but with spravato, you really can't go into the office. If you work remotely, you probably could squeeze in a few hours at home, but some people feel too sleepy.

"I didn’t notice Modafinil 200mg at all when I first took it. Very subtle. Then I took 150mg Armodafinil and a whole new world opened up.

I find that with daily dosing, all cognitive benefits disappear after about a week of continuous use.

If it helps, I was also on 50mg Pristiq and 30mg Mirtazapine at the time when I took Armodafinil. As a mild SNRI Pristiq can help a bit with critical thinking and also Mirtazapine blocks 5HT2C, 5HT2A and 5HT3 receptors, all of which have procognitive benefits IIRC.

Don’t even get me started on the whole “yeah but Mirtazapine knocks you out how can it be pro-cognitive” bandwagon junk. The stereoisomer that acts as an antihistamine has a shorter half life than the stereoisomer with cognitive benefits.

You get a great sleep at night thanks to Mirtazapine, take an SNRI and Armodafinil (a mild DRI) in the morning and you’re on top of the world - in a productive way too; not in a manic sense.

This combo got me great results at uni when I used it during exams and the preceding exam study week. 

This combination is preferable to my current combination of Duloxetine, Dextroamphetamine and Armodafinil.

Turns out one of the reasons Armodafinil helped me so much is because I actually have Narcolepsy Type 2. Officially diagnosed 3 years after I tried it as a nootropic.

As for donepezil, as an agent that increases acetylcholine, all I noticed was increased anxiety, intestinal hypermotility with diarrhea and nausea and essential tremors. Basically the opposite of what you get when you take anticholinergics. Anticholinergics actually have more benefits for me, personally. Many anticholinergics (like hyoscine) are speculated to be rapid-acting antidepressants. The “cognitive impairment” they cause also enables me to shut off all the internal, unhelpful mental chatter and focus on the task at hand. It should be borne in mind that drugs that increase dopamine tend to have mild anticholinergic side effects like dry mouth. This is because increasing dopamine levels in the brain tends to decrease acetylcholine levels and vice versa.

Like with all drugs, you develop a tolerance to the positive benefits very quickly. I believe this to be the case with antidepressants in general as well. Perhaps one of the reasons it takes so long to develop a tolerance to a certain dose of an SSRI/SNRI is because they take so god damn long to actually do anything for depression in the first place.

You notice that the benefits obtained from immediately helpful drugs (benefits within hours, if not an hour or less) - like stimulants for fatigue/cognitive enhancement and benzos for anxiety - very quickly lose their value after a few weeks of sustained use. Drugs that take way longer to have any benefit just seem to take longer for those benefits to fade. Probably because it simply takes your brain longer to realise that your baseline homeostatic level of neurohormone/neurotransmitters is off and readjust to achieve homeostasis. 

I doubt there have been many studies - let alone metanalyses - of the diminishing benefits of a certain dose of antidepressants over a number of years. Such studies would take probably a decade to obtain results even with minimal rates of participant drop-outs. And there’s no real benefit to industry in conducting such studies, so where is the funding going to come from?

But a lot of scientific discovery really does start with the collection of anecdotes, which leads to empirical investigation. This is how we discovered that benzodiazepines have terrible withdrawal symptoms, rebound anxiety and escalation of doses to achieve the same effect. Now just think about all the times you’ve heard people say they kept increasing the dose of an SSRI over the years until the benefits faded completely and they had to add another drug or switch to something else like an SNRI."		reply	na	na	na	0.01311464048922062	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"Seems like you had a bit of success from Nardil (or at least not total failure). Could be worth trying Parnate. Parnate seems to be slightly more popular because of the milder side effect profile. People tend to find it less sedating and more stimulating (mind you, Parnate personally knocked me out completely but that’s not the average response). Also less side effects like trouble urinating, edema, weight gain, etc. that Nardil often comes along with. I tried both and MAOIs weren’t for me but they help a lot of people. Marplan is also an option but I never personally tried it. 

Someone else mentioned pramipexole which is also worth a shot. Just important to do your research because there are some serious risks. But that’s the case with many meds that end up working. (There are similar meds usually used for Parkinson’s or RLS that have shown similar effectiveness in treatment resistant types of depression as well). 

I had really great success with low dose buprenorphine for about two years but you’re ultimately choosing to take an opioid which comes with its own issues. And it’s very hard to get prescribed for anything other than MAT. I was very lucky. 

I was taking Stablon (tianeptine) with some success before getting pregnant (currently six months along) and I plan to restart it after I give birth. For me, the best part was that it had no side effects and the side effects are what usually make me stop any given medication. I would sometimes take it with Ritalin but usually just as monotherapy. It was mild (12.5mg 3x daily is the therapeutic dose) but it helped. 

Even if you don’t want to try another MAOI, I’d recommend joining r/MAOIs because the people in that sub are really informed about lesser known options and have a wealth of experience and advice. Some really brilliant folks in there.

Edit: Besides getting everything checked out physically to ensure you’re not suffering from something else entirely like thyroid or hormonal issues, it’s probably worth ensuring that depression is the right diagnosis.

"Tolerance is normal and expected. Any good ADHD doctor would have told you that you start on a low dose, but then titrate up over a long period of time to find your post-tolerance (or ""long term"") dose.

Let's give a concrete example: suppose day 1 of taking Ritalin 10mg, you feel X units of positive effects.

Then, after a few days it goes down to 0.5X and subjectively feels like it's not working anymore.

You then up the dose to 20mg. Now you're back to X. But then even more tolerance sets in, and you only feel 0.67X.

Next, you up the dose again, to 30mg. Now you feel X, then tolerance sets in and you're back to 0.75X.

The point is, the post-tolerance felt effect does gradually get closer and closer to what you feel is the right amount. At some point, you say ""I'm close enough"". Something I like to say now is that there's **always** gonna be tolerance, but it's **never** full tolerance."	spacer_1k9	reply	na	na	na	0.9994555115699768	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens

For sure, they will have very different demand on Vit D to get the same blood-level!

Just to give you  some numbers:  
(DISCLAIMER:   
This is my personal experiance, not a medical advice.  
Take care and time to find your level. An intoxination with VitD is possible!)

with 20.000 units PER DAY my level raises.  
So \_\_\_my\_\_\_\_ maintenance level is 17.000 units per day.  
Repeat that: seventeen-thousand units per day for KEEPING the level.  
My familiy doctor and my endocrinologist can not explain, why my blood levels are perfect even with this high doses. I should be far far in the intoxination, just from this intake, but I am not. I do seriously monitoring, to stay on that level.

I was down on 11ng/ml blood. I lived like a emotionfree zombie.  
I took 60.000 units per day for weeks to ramp up (Days exactly counted!)  
Landed on my goal of \~90ng. LIFE IS GREAT!

Recommendation:  
\-Test. (e.g. ceratest dot com)  
\-Increase intake.  
\-Repeat until you are on your personal good level of VItD IN BLOOD. THis is the only relevant number.

"Hello! New here. I’m 34, mom of 5 kids under 10 years old, married for 11 years. 

I’ve battled anxiety sporadically throughout my life. The worst bout was 8 years ago after the birth of my 2nd son. I had debilitating health anxiety, racing thoughts, lost so much weight, etc. got on lexapro and it helped SO MUCH. I tried getting off of it for a couple months while pregnant with 3rd son and it was a bad idea. Got right back on it and was on it ever since. 

Fast forward to the end of 2022/beginning of 2023. We’ve experienced huge financial hardship and lot of family drama with extended family members on my side which was hard in every aspect of our life. I finally realized in April I was very depressed - lack of motivation, lack of focus, trouble completing tasks, not looking forward to the things I normally look forward to.. got in touch with a psychiatrist and counselor. My psychiatrist thought maybe I’ve grown immune to lexapro and recommended Wellbutrin. Tried Wellbutrin for 21 days and did not like it. Hurt my stomach, wasn’t helping my motivation or attention span, etc. she thought about trying Effexor or Wellbutrin with a mood stabilizer (forgot name) or trying adderall for ADHD. Ive had ADHD tendencies practically since elementary school but I’ve never pursed diagnosis or treatment. I’ve enjoyed having a sex drive back and experiencing some new emotions that were dormant for 8 years while on lexapro so we went the adderall route. It really hasn’t done much for me at all and now I just don’t know what to do. I tried it for 6 days and we tried different times and doses. It didn’t really motivate me or help with attention/focus. I had 10mg tablets and we tried variations and the most I tried at once was 15mg. Now I’m really leaning towards really needing to tackle this from a depression standpoint. 

I’m hesitant to try Effexor because I hear there’s some nasty side effects and withdrawal side effects. 

My questions if you’ve read this long - 1. Does is sound like depression or adhd? Or both? 2. What would you recommend I do moving forward? I feel hopeless and defeated 😩. TIA"	Ok-Cost-4599	post	29.418905063207898	male	White	0.9979466795921326	na	na	na	9	depressionregimens

"I’ve been reading a lot about Saffron extract and NAC individually, both sound very interesting, but I haven’t found anything how well they’d work together.

SO FAR:
For the past decade I’ve been going back and forth on various SSRIs and Wellbutrin, but neither seem to get me out of my anhedonia and intrusive thoughts that make it hard to work, keep a consistent schedule, which in return creates anxiety. 

SSRIs (Cipralex, Zoloft, Citalopram) side effects profile disagree with me (libido issues, makes me a yawning zombie, blunted emotions, brain zaps when discontinuing them). But from the blood work I had done, residual Serotonin does seem very low). On the plus side, although the initial side effects aren’t worth it overall, they keep me slightly more balanced.

Wellbutrin XR 150mg (until recently for the 5th time). The positive effects are very subtle overall, but I don’t want to go to 300mg, as I find the increased sweating and anxiety that gives me slight brain fog too annoying on the 150mg already. On the plus side, I really like the vivid dreams and how my libido is on it.

The general problem is that I suffer from mild to medium depression and whenever I want to do something about changing my situation, which is always stress-filled due to the years of procrastination, any bit of extra stress, like learning a new skill or solving problems, usually causes stress to spike to the point of brain fog and exhaustion. So I’ve been spending a great deal of the last few years with dopamine releasing distractions, to the point where I feel I need a restart in order become my old self again, who could keep himself busy acquiring new skills or practicing existing ones.

TL;DR:
Could NAC and saffron extract work as a milder anti-depressant combo that gives me the same benefits SSRI’s and Wellbutrin have without the side effects profile? Are there any interactions I should concern myself with?"	Jimmy_Popkins	post	34.440659276567686	male	White	0.003881801851093769	na	na	na	3	depressionregimens

"My doc prescribed me Mirtazapine (Remeron) & Pregabalin (Lyrica) for months now. I took the Mirtazapine like a year ago but tapered it off months ago by myself as I thought it made me more stupid (which I still feel like, even after half a year off it). Withdrawal was okay, no big issue other than maybe a week of bad feelings and no sleep/no eat. 

I never told my doc that I tapered it off by myself cause she had this medication plan and I really liked the Pregabalin which still helps me a lot (if I don‘t take it daily). 

I now was 2 months unable to visit my doc cause my insurance was expired. I want to use this as an argument that I got off the Mirtazapine by myself and just used Lyrica as needed (amazing that the Lyrica she gave me lasted that long cause I really thought that I was going empty when I took it daily for some time).

What should I tell my doc? She will be asking what I have done these 2 months not insured and visiting her and not having any prescription of new Mirtazapine. I don‘t need the Mirtazapine cause I don‘t want to worsen my cognitive issues and I sleep and eat better now even without it. It was a good med but I don‘t need it anymore - at least right now.

I thought about just telling her that I either tapered it off by myself in these 2 months „cause I wasn‘t insured anymore and worried“ or that I asked my doc in my home country or my grandpa who‘s a doc how to taper and got off of it by that = how I was able to be 2 months without new prescription and never contacting her (I really didn‘t cause I was really not in a good mood, depressed, no drive). 

Now I want to go to her cause I soon need a new lyrica prescription but also wanna try new meds for my mental health.

"Hello all, I'm pleased to be writing a positive post here for once. All my previous posts have been about  finding medications and methods to deal with suicidal thoughts. Well, its been about 2 months since I've had a suicidal thought. I love living, and I don't want to die anymore. I haven't had a single negative thought in the span of these last 2 months. I don't believe I suffer from any depression anymore as well. Before I go into what worked for me, I'd like to describe how my mental health used to be. I was dealing with very, very intense suicidal thoughts for 6-8 months. These thoughts occurred every single day, and occurred almost every single hour. Life was so incredibly dark for me, I'm surprised I didn't lose myself in the process. I would wake up and think about killing myself. Before sleep, I would pray for my life to end. When I was hanging out with my friends, random suicidal thoughts would flood my mind. I hated everything and everyone. However, more importantly, I hated myself. The mental state I was in was so disgusting it's hard to describe. Having so much hatred, disdain, and disgust toward everything and everyone was incredibly unpleasant and made life hell. 

**The change:**

Medication: The lord and savior of mental health issues, medication. I've trailed and errored so many different medications I almost gave up on them. Besides trying a boatload of different anti-depressants (typical and atypical), I also tried various other things. These things include ketamine infusions and ECT. Neither the medications nor the ketamine or ECT helped. ECT was actually discontinued after the 4th treatment due to the side effects being unbearable. However, I started to see a new doctor that was very nice and willing to try multiple different medications for the sake of my health. What really worked the most was the following: Lithium carbonate 300mg, Effexor XR 37.5mg, Modafinil 100mg, and Methylphenidate 18mg. This combination of medication helped a LOT.

Lifestyle: By far the biggest changes to my mental health occurred when I started studying 4 hours a day and reading 1 hour. I started studying for my CCNA certificate and I was reading whenever I had the time to do so. I worked 35 hours a week so I had plentiful time to read and study. I did this everyday for about 4 weeks. During the end of my 4 weeks, I got a new remote job! Working from home has improved my quality of life significantly. It also helps that I actually don't mind my job one bit. In the past, I used to hate Mondays. However, things have changed, and I actually don't care when my weekend ends. I really don't hate my job one bit. It helps to do work you're good at and that you find rather easy to perform. I also adapted a different mindset entirely on my mental health. Instead of wishing to die, I wished to live. I started to get mad at the fact that I wanted to die. If I was givin this incredibily rare chance at life, how pathetic would it be for me to kill myself?  Why not TRY to live my life to the best of my ability. In an infinite timeline, I better do my best to make something out of my life. I now have an entire career path and goals I've laid out for myself. I know exactly what I want out of life and I also know that I'll obtain said goals. 

Sorry for the longish post, I just wanted to share my exciting news! Thanks to everybody in this sub. This is by far, the best depression sub in existence. It isn't an echo chamber of negativity and suicidal stuff like other subs on reddit. This sub aims to help those and uplift them as well. I hope you all get better and find worth in life. If I can beat my previous mental state, you guys can as well. I went from wanting to die everyday to wanting to live :)"	Jazzlike_Composer990	post	25.40948940748754	female	White	0.001550006214529276	na	na	na	16	depressionregimens

"It's very uplifting to come across positive news here. I also noticed that you're currently taking ADHD medication (methylphenidate). Were you prescribed Ritalin as part of ADHD treatment or to counter-act the cognitive decline that often comes with major depression?

Today, I took my first dosage of Vyvanse, which works in a slightly different way. While it's still early to say if the treatment is working, I'm already noticing a significant shift in my perspective on life. It feels like it's worth living and doing things again. This all began when I switched from my previous psychiatrist (who was very affectionate but failed horribly to interpret my symptoms and educate me) and looked for opinions from three different professionals. They concluded that my depression and anxiety were secondary to long-standing issues that have been present throughout my life, namely the symptoms of ADHD. Seeking second opinions is crucial to people like us, who are trying for years. I know that getting information from reputable doctors is expensive and time-consuming (especially if you live in countries like the US), but it's important to aim high because unfortunately inadequate information and communication are very common in the medical class. 

I appreciate that you chose to share your remission story in this sub. Unfortunately, hopelessness and misinformation often prevails in self-support groups, as most of us are already going through various medications and therapy approaches for so many years. But our experiences are living proof that our journey may be more challenging, but ultimately is worth taking. None of us are permanently broken, and I am really happy for you."

Thank you for such a thoughtful, detailed response. I have sleep apena, bi polar, which has been in the depressive state for years and chronic fatigue. She finally listened to me about the chronic fatigue and that’s when she mentioned modafinal. I was in such a bad state that I ordered modafinal online from India. I’m not sure how potent it was or even if it was the correct formulation so I am excited to try it from an actual pharmacy. The one from India helped a bit but not as much as I would have hoped. That’s why I was more leaning toward Vyvannse. Mostly, my chronic fatigue is causing me to sleep my life away and I have no motivation due to the depression and it is very difficult for me to concentrate. I may have to switch Drs. if the modafinal doesn’t work	Jazzlike_Composer990	reply	na	na	na	0.001550006214529276	weak	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
I was prescribed Concerta as part of my ADHD treatment! I believe that getting prescribed ADHD medication was the pivotal moment in my treatment plan. I have really bad ADHD and it ruins a lot of things for me. With my medication, I'm able to focus on my work. I feel so much better mentally and my mind feels more calm with the medication. Also, I absolutely agree that getting second opinions is so so important. Doctors don't know everything, and often they may make poor decisions. Getting a second opinion if you believe your current issues aren't being dealt with should be a top priority.

I was prescribed them together! It's very interesting that your doctor wants to check your heart before giving you modafinil. Moda is a non-amphetamine central nervous system (CNS) stimulant with wakefulness-promoting properties. Technically, it isn't even a stimulant, the stimulation is a side effect. I guess it can increase heart rate slightly, so it may make sense to check your heart health. I take both moda and concerta together everyday, along with caffeine. My heart rate remains at 56-66 bpm and my blood pressure stays at 118/66! I hope you're able to get moda. If you aren't message me. I know good sources that allow you to purchase modafinil of off the internet :) I used to purchase them off of the internet before getting it prescribed.

"Great to hear about your Concerta experience! My experience with Vyvanse yesterday was mostly positive and somewhat revealing. Unfortunately, I self-sabotaged by binge drinking. I didn't feel the intense concentration like I did with Ritalin, but I felt calmer and, ironically, less impulsive. Honestly, not having racing thoughts was initially weird, and I worry it might affect my long-term creativity - but if it helps me control my inner turmoil, then so be it. I'm still in the early stages of treatment, and other drugs like s-ketamine (which improved my mood but worsened my ADHD symptoms) are still in my system. So, I don't quite know yet how I'm supposed to feel on amphetamines. It didn't help that Vyvanse drastically reduced the feelings of intoxication while I was chugging copious amounts of alcohol, but I've come to realize that my erratic drinking is also a habit that won't stop just by taking Vyvanse alone. Now it seems I have the tool to help me stop it. I took the pill today as well, but as expected after a night of bingeing, the potential benefits are quite limited.

Did you experience dry mouth and a rapid heartbeat when you first used Concerta? I know these are different drugs, but I've read that these symptoms are common with stimulants. My doctor assured me that it's normal, but I admit I'm looking forward to them going away. The adaptation process is the hardest part for me. I find it challenging to stick to the plan and envision a positive future when I start feeling the side effects, and I'm a little worried that it'll handicap my ability of expressing emotion. ADHD and BPD share several symptoms, such as rejection sensitive dysphoria (albeit at different levels). This similarity makes me wonder if the treatment trade-off, seen in BPD with the use of antipsychotics, is also comparable: exchanging intense emotions for a more subdued affect. I was actually expecting to be able to express emotions more effectively, as I'm quite apathetic sometimes and it has even cost me a job because my coworkers thought I was internally judging them (the resting bitch face curse is REAL 😂)."

"I live in Brazil, where Vyvanse is classified as a substance that cannot be prescribed online. I am uncertain about its regulations in other countries, but here, I needed to be in my doctor's office when he prescribed it. The argument is that psychostimulants are easily abusable, even though anecdotal evidence suggests that it significantly reduces impulsivity in people actually suffering from ADHD (but here's the catch: people that weren't diagnosed with ADHD were much more likely to use amphetamines/methylphenidate as a potent equivalent to caffeine pills, or as recreative drugs; in college, I even had a diagnosed friend who sold Ritalin pills as party favors, because they were so popular). 

Now, I'm the first to admit that your doctor likely possesses superior knowledge in this matter, so there is little I can add. Please understand that to me, you are merely a block of text, and I do not intend to be impolite. While I am not an expert, it is known that modafinil functions as a modulator of the wakefulness system, acting as a stimulant that differs greatly from Vyvanse (and even Ritalin). These medications are prescribed for ADHD because they address various executive dysfunctions, such as selective attention, impulse control, and emotional fluctuations, rather than solely enhancing wakefulness. Although it has been excluded from the DSM-V, individuals with ADHD are known to exhibit poor responses to perceived rejection, a condition referred to as rejection sensitive dysphoria. This characteristic is even more pronounced in individuals with BPD and C-PTSD, who may resort to drastic behaviors like cutting to avoid/alleviate such rejection, unlike the majority of individuals with ADHD. Ritalin, Adderall, Concerta and Vyvanse are known to bring people with ADHD to their baseline emotion levels, while in people without ADHD they can induce flat affect. That's why children diagnosed early with ADHD or overmedicated are stigmatized as ""little robots"". 

What I can suggest is that you try to describe your feelings as accurately as possible. If you believe they are more aligned with ADHD rather than depression combined with fatigue (assuming you and your doctor are not referring to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, which entails greater severity and involves significant pain and immobility), I would advise you to persist in exploring the possibility of trying a stimulant such as Ritalin or Adderall, including their extended-release formulations, such as Concerta and Vyvanse. However, if you are experiencing only fatigue, I would consider other factors, such as nutrient deficiencies, severe sleep apnea - which I also have, by the way, along with delayed sleep phase syndrome -, or even a lingering depression effect that may not have been adequately addressed by antidepressants. However, I would caution against dismissing modafinil outright and immediately turning to medications (Vyvanse) that hasn't been proven to be the optimal alternative for your discussed symptoms.

And if you sense that your psychiatrist doesn't hear your concerns, simply switch, even if you have a good relationship with them. I had a fantastic relationship with my former psychiatrist, but she was incompetent and uninformed, subjecting me to over 25 pills, some of which had no relevance to my symptoms and caused severe side effects.

"Hi all! I'm an entrepreneur, and after a couple of years of burnout, my condition has significantly worsened two months ago, and I've been diagnosed with moderate to severe clinical depression. I've been having an indescribable feeling of sorrow, anxiety, apathy, helplessness and emptiness; in the first week of the whole episode, it was even hard to get out of my bed. For the past two months, whenever worked (or even just thinking about work), I would experience immense anxiety, fear and (sometimes) anger, as well as physical symptoms, such as massive headache, body tremors, and faster heart beats (and one time, almost hyperventilating). As a result, I've not been productive at work and in every sense of the word, dreaded it.

  
I've been taking some time off work, been in therapy and implemented new habits (living healthier, through exercise, diets, sleep, meditation), but recovery has not been linear (some days are better, some days are worse), and the anxiety and fear around work remains. The trauma around anything remotely related to work is real -- I still can't open/reply email, or think of anything/anyone around work at all -- all of these give me tremendous fear and anxiety. I've been totally offline for the better part of the last couple of weeks, but got an urgent update that a commercial deal we had been working on had fallen through, and it may have dire business consequences. It's hugely upsetting because I had hoped that the company (my business partner and the rest of the team) should be able to take care of these things without me, and it doesn't seem to be that way. Things at work are obviously worse now, and I won't be able to go back to work peacefully.

  
Right now, I'm just feeling a whole range of emotions -- sadness, anxiety, fear, helplessness, emptiness, anger and resentment. Maybe it's the depression speaking, but I've been thinking -- I've dedicated so much of my time, effort and personal resources into the company, and it seems that no one in the team (including my business partner) was as committed as me. At this moment, I want to prioritize healing, and even then, I'm not able to fully relax and recover. A part of me want to just abandon everything and focus on healing, but I'm too sad and anxious to even do anything remotely related to work.

  
Apologies for the long post, but I've been feeling so sad and lonely, and advice of what you would do, would be hugely appreciated!"	throwaway-78285	post	36.94201787800319	female	White	0.9898507595062256	na	na	na	6	depressionregimens

I shut down my business last Summer after struggling with COVID and the stress of having a small child while trying to run a business. My depression has spiralled for the last 10 months. I had zero motivation to go back to the industry I was working in before I started my business but it was really the only option I had. I tried freelancing for a while but it was really difficult to find work and that just caused more stress, which made my depression even worse. I started going to a new therapist 2 weeks ago and it has helped me just talk through some things. I've been trying to adopt healthier habits like eating better and exercising more. The thing that has helped the most is just focusing on my son. I didn't really have the time to appreciate how fun he is. This is something that is hard for me to deal, but no one will ever be as committed to your business as you are. I'm not sure if you deal with this too but my business kind of became my identity and it was/is hard for me to separate the two. I've been trying to reconnect with the things I used to do that made me happy like drawing, fishing, and playing music. I've also been trying to find some new hobbies to keep myself busy so I'm not sitting and dwelling on no longer having the business.

"First is to fully understand what’s going on. Why are you feeling this way? What brings you to this point in your life? I did an archeological dig of my entire life and psychological profiling/analysis of my parents when I was in a similar situation. And once you train yourself to understand exactly why you feel the way you do, the healing can begin. It’s like an experienced mechanic who listens to the sound of an engine and can pinpoint the problem with accuracy. You’re actually inside the machine so you’re best positioned to hear what the problem is. 

It’s weird to wake up one day and not understand the most obvious facts of your life. To be in a decades long denial about certain subpar and downright horrific circumstances faced in childhood or elsewhere. A lot of healing ideally would take place on your own. A crash course on how to do that is to journal or speak into a voice recorded as candidly frank and honest as you can regularly. Every day build on the foundation of your understanding of your life. Why is it structured this way, why do you experience depression or anxiety. These things don’t emanate out of nothingness. However you’re feeling is incredibly rational and normal and painful. 

A word on therapists, I’d say go through many of them and then use your instinct to pick the one that will help you heal. I went through a dozen people before I found one that knew what they were doing. The rest for one reason or another was a waste of time. You have to understand what is a waste of time and what isn’t in healing. 

As for what to do in terms of your job and all the rest of your life I say no one is better positioned to make those decisions than you are. What does your gut tell you?

"Quitting Effexor abruptly without tapering off is not advisable, especially if you are on a high dosage like the one you are taking. I personally found it extremely difficult, and I was only taking 75 mg. Effexor is known for having one of the most severe withdrawal syndromes among antidepressants. Many people who attempt to quit cold turkey end up experiencing worsened symptoms and often return to their doctor, who then prescribes Prozac because it has been shown to alleviate some of the side effects (like brain zaps), along with a more responsible tapering schedule. 

However, it's important not to dismiss the possibility that you may have been mistreated by your healthcare provider. While you haven't provided much useful information here, the behaviors you described, such as anger outbursts and impulsive cold turkey, are more characteristic of core symptoms associated with BPD and ADHD. What does ""weak personality"" even mean? Detailed language is key when describing your symptoms, because a psychiatrist might interpret this as an identity disturbance (which is more akin to BPD), as chronic boredom and lack of long-lasting hobbies (which is more like ADHD, since you're always jumping to whatever gives you a quick dopamine fix) or as something else entirely.

I don't want to jump to conclusions or offer a diagnosis since I'm not an expert, but it's crucial to rely on trustworthy sources of information, such as professional doctors (and remember: not every psychiatrist is equally equipped to deal with mental problems, so you should aim high if you can) and peer-reviewed studies, rather than random individuals on Reddit. Even though accessing good healthcare can be expensive in some countries, like the US, seeking second opinions is essential when you've been dealing with mental health issues for so long.

On another note, I came across a comment suggesting the use of ketamine. I wanted to mention that novel medications like s-ketamine (applied to the nose in a clinical setting), IV-ketamine (through the veins, again supervised by doctors), Auvelity, and psychedelics have shown promising efficacy rates, quicker results, and fewer side effects. Personally, s-ketamine worked better for my mood than any traditional antidepressant, allowing me time to research my condition (unfortunately, my previous psychiatrist was inadequate in educating me about it, as she should have done). However, it did come with some downsides: Spravato is VERY expensive and I had to rely on my insurance, the dissociation was very strong when I was anxious, my racing thoughts worsened, and I struggled to function during the four days between sessions. Basically, I just played video games, watched cartoons and avoided any intellectual activity, even though I was happier and much less of a worrier. It doesn't mean that you'll have the same side effects, since every organism is different.

Now, my healthcare providers have adopted a more holistic approach that addresses ADHD as the primary cause of my dysphoria and unmotivation, as it's been shown that it's a common symptom of many mental health disorders, not only affective ones. I'm taking fewer medications than I've ever had, and I'm feeling much better than I did when I took a cocktail of five or more pills (by the way, my previous psychiatrist put me through more than 25 different kinds of pills, so I understand your hopelessness). 

Again, I strongly advise against taking the risk of quitting venlafaxine abruptly. There is still much we don't know, and the field of psychiatry is fortunately rapidly evolving beyond the use of SSRIs, SNRIs, mood stabilizers like carbolithium, and antipsychotics. When in crisis, it's best to avoid seeking information from subreddits where most individuals are also suffering and desperately seeking relief. I've been in that position before, and I can attest that reliable and useful information is scarce. Moreover, if you are in such a vulnerable state, it's unlikely that you'll be able to make well-informed decisions based on the information you find here - there will be a lot of cognitive biases going on. Just be patient (which I know is barely possible when you're suffering, but please try) and search for second, capable opinions, and other therapeutic interventions beyond meds, like CBT, DBT, EMDR, guided meditation/mindfulness etc. Whatever works for you."

"Yeah, but once again, I was taking a relatively low dose of Effexor (75 mg). Instead of going cold turkey, I gradually reduced the dosage, but even that didn't prevent me from experiencing side effects. The problem is that where I live, Effexor is only available in capsules that can't be split. So, I had to go from 75 mg to 37.5 mg, which isn't the recommended tapering (doctors usually suggest lowering it by 10 mg every other week to minimize the effects). It was tough. I had severe suicidal thoughts, awful headaches, restlessness, and had more difficulty reading (even regular stuff on Reddit) and doing everyday tasks or even simple stuff that I enjoy. Getting out of bed in the morning was a struggle, and I would often break down in tears.

Luckily, I was already taking Prozac along with Effexor, which might have saved me from even more unbearable side effects like brain zaps. After two challenging weeks, I started feeling much better and began tapering off Prozac as well, since it was causing other issues like emotional numbness and sexual dysfunction. My previous doctor prescribed agomelatine and increased my s-ketamine sessions. Agomelatine is considered one of the less effective antidepressants because it targets melatonin receptors instead of serotonin/norepinephrine receptors, but it also has the fewest side effects. At the moment, it seemed tailor-made to me, because I wasn't in a crisis anymore and I'm very sensitive to side effects.

This week, I stopped taking s-ketamine because I couldn't start Vyvanse while on it (both medications raise blood pressure), and although s-ketamine improved my mood, it worsened my ADHD symptoms. I'm still taking agomelatine because I haven't experienced any side effects, and it seems to help regulate my sleep without making me drowsy.

"**TW: suicidal ideation**

Long story short, I cut things off with my last therapist after she sent the police to my apartment because I didn’t respond to one of her messages in 15 hours. I was at work at the time, but apparently the police scared the shit out of my roommates and were banging on the door. Now my roommates know I’m suicidal as well (they knew I was depressed, but not how severely). Honestly, the whole event shattered my trust in therapy and now I feel genuinely frightened to go back. 

**The next two paragraphs are just pure venting, TLDR is at the last paragraph. I’m sorry for all the text.**

Ever since I disclosed my suicidal ideation to my therapist it felt like she began to trust me less and less. I repeatedly told her that I have never had any actual intention to hurt myself and that I have never developed any plans, which is the truth. I told her that while I might indeed feel a constant, strong desire to end my life and put a stop to the pain, a desire is all that it’s ever been and it ever will be for the foreseeable future, unless I completely lose my mental faculties. The one and only thing I am truly committed to in this life is to avoid hurting my mom, so I swore to myself that no matter how difficult it gets, I will stay alive as long as she is alive. I will wait until she is no longer here to die. If I can’t even do that one thing, if I can’t even fulfill my one commitment in life and protect the person that I care about most from suffering because of MY own flaws, that means my life was a complete failure. I told my therapist all of this, and yet she just couldn’t trust me at all. And if my therapist can’t trust me, how am I supposed to reciprocate?

The thing is, that wasn’t even the only way my therapist damaged my trust as my relationship with her deteriorated, it was just the straw that broke the camel’s back. I also can’t even say that I really blame her. Suicidal patients cannot be easy to deal with especially with the limited resources these practitioners are given, so really it’s probably just my fault for being born so mentally fragile (maybe I’m unfixable) as well as the medical system’s fault for being so rigid and inflexible in how it handles mentally ill patients. Nonetheless, I would have much much rather that they just fired me as a patient instead of call the police on my residence, and I’m just shocked that they legitimately thought this was the best way to help me. 

**TLDR:** This was several months ago, and at the time, I thought this wouldn’t effect me that much. However, now I’m realizing that I’m actually really scared of going back to therapy. It felt dehumanizing to have my trust damaged like that, and having the authorities called on me by my own therapist made me feel like a lost cause. Even if I were to ever go back to therapy I’m not sure if I would ever feel comfortable disclosing my suicidal thoughts again. But at the same time, with absolutely no one to talk to, I can feel my suicidal ideation worsening and spiraling. The past year has ruthlessly beaten me down in many ways, but now I’m just at a loss. What do I do? If anyone could give their thoughts, I would appreciate it so much."	jwappy9	post	21.94329868515525	female	White	0.9983254075050354	na	na	na	6	depressionregimens
"Did your therapist talk through with you at the first session their approach to being concerned you would move from having suicidal thoughts to action? Or when you first raised that you have suicidal ideation?

I'm both a clinician and a person who has experienced severe mental illness including episodes of suicidal thoughts.

In response to finding out just how many of my patients have trauma I did specific training on setting boundaries and clear plans. This helped me hugely address difficult situations by being proactive. The other thing I did was start to get supervision by a trauma informed social worker.

It sounds to me as if you need to find someone who has a decent level of training on managing risk. The only way of doing this is to ask to speak with them and ask what their process is if they are concerned about your thoughts or behavior. Vague is bad. Specific is good. A written policy is best practice.

In my policy I ask directly if thoughts have progressed to planning how to die. We then discuss safety plans, and I ask if their primary doctor is aware they are in a worsening state. Usually I can phone and get a same day appointment with their doctor while they are present. Once or twice in 20 years I've made the phone call to their doctor without them present and mostly their doctor will call them.

If I'm particularly worried I will also message my supervisor for a debrief. We have a standard approach of going through what was done and then her asking why this client has been particularly triggering for my need to look after people.

We will examine it further at our next formal session. 

Your therapist by her actions sounds like she's taking on too much responsibility for her clients. Unless you had a between sessions messaging agreement then it's acceptable you don't respond and she should not escalate to the police. She can escalate it to your primary doctor or next of kin."	jwappy9	reply	na	na	na	0.9983254075050354	no	strong	strong	na	depressionregimens
"Sorry if my writing is disjointed, it's just kind of my stream of thoughts at the moment.

I'm sorry that you went through that, it's a fear I have sometimes as well. Fortunately, all of my providers have been very understanding whenever I disclosed that I had suicidal thoughts. I guess the threshold for what constitutes a mental health crisis is different, and some people are a little too jumpy on the ""you need to go to the hospital right away"" thing, which isn't feasible for those of us who deal with it every day.

I just want to say that you're not mentally fragile--at least, not necessarily as much as you think you are. The thing that many of us demonstrate, even though we don't notice, is resilience. We live day-in and day-out with these terrible burdens, in constant agony, with the odds all seemingly against us, yet we continue to survive until we simply can't anymore.

I used to struggle with constant suicidal ideation and urges to self-harm in the most brutal ways, I was convinced that mutilating or disemboweling myself and dying a slow and painful death was the only way to stop the agony I was in.

The strongest people I've ever met in my life were other people in the psychiatric ward I spent a week in when I was 18. They'd all been to hell and back, and their struggles seemed to make mine seem like a walk in the park--yet there they were, still alive after it all. It gave me hope even in the darkest times what people were capable of surviving, even if they ended up in a psychiatric ward, it's better than dying. And people aren't any weaker for choosing to go out on their own terms, either. I don't like the phrase ""x lost their battle with depression/cancer/etc."" because it makes it sound like it was a failure on their part, and that's why they lost--when that's not the case in actuality.

I am no longer in therapy because I can't really afford the cost anymore after 4 years of therapy, but I hope to return to it one day.

One thing I would suggest is, going forward, if you choose to see a therapist again (which I think would be a good idea), to ask about how they handle suicidal ideation and emergencies--what their threshold is for hospitalization and such. This should help manage expectations better. I would also mention to them that you work and may not be able to answer messages for several hours, in case they do need to message you. Additionally, setting up an action plan with them in case of an emergency should help assuage their fears. In my action plan, it goes friends-therapist/crisis counselor (if my therapist is unavailable)-hospital, so my therapist knows that they won't necessarily be my first contact in the event of a psychiatric emergency. You're doing the right thing by making sure to mention that you have no plan or intention to hurt yourself--that's often the bar for when people consider it an emergency."	jwappy9	reply	na	na	na	0.9983254075050354	strong	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
"Hi, I feel like your therapist was in the wrong. I’ve done therapy multiple times and the only time they will get the police involved is if you are going to harm yourself or someone else. I’m not sure what exactly happened at your last session, how did it end? And what was the message she sent you? 

Suicidal ideation is not the same as harming yourself. And if you clarified that you don’t have plans to act this out then I don’t understand why she would call the police?"	jwappy9	reply	na	na	na	0.9983254075050354	weak	strong	strong	na	depressionregimens
"

Thank you for kindly providing your professional insight, this is a very helpful response for multiple reasons. 

First, I can say that I definitely do not recall ever having that kind of conversation with my therapist regarding setting boundaries or plans, not once in my 2+ year relationship with her. Only later into the relationship did I disclose suicidal ideation to her, but even then we did not have any kind of formal discussion on what constituted passive vs. active suicidal ideation and when intervention would be taken. She was pretty vague the entire time and I remember that actually used to kind of scare me because I wasn’t sure what signs would prompt a reaction from her, and it even seemed a bit inconsistent at times.

She would always ask me if I had any plan and I would always say no, simply because that was always the truth. I would also always say that I do not have any actual intention to harm myself. But then she would oftentimes just keep probing and it legitimately felt to me as if she was trying to bait me into giving a response she was looking for, but I’m sure I’m just overthinking that part. I fully believe that my therapist always had good intentions (aside from anything related to suicidal ideation she was great to work with), but it just seemed as if she just couldn’t trust me whatsoever. 

I remember two weeks before the police incident I actually tried to be frank with her because I was feeling frustrated about how our sessions have been going, and I was starting to feel desperate. I told her that I felt a significant disconnect with her and that I would really appreciate if she could trust me when I tell her that I am not a threat to myself. I told her that I just really want to be able to discuss my suicidal ideation without her being immediately concerned about my safety and/or suggesting hospitalization. Of course I would also repeat to her that as long as my mom is on this planet, I am determined to stay alive - I would repeat this so often because I genuinely believed this would convince her, because my mom legitimately IS far and away the #1 reason I am alive, surpassing even my innate fear of death.

I just realized how much I rambled here, so I really apologize for that. There was just a lot of context I wanted to add haha. But going back to what I wrote earlier, your message is hugely helpful to me because it indicates that maybe my experience with my last therapist was not the norm, or the standard. I really liked working with my last therapist and I trusted her quite a bit, so it really did hurt me when all of that happened, and I guess that just negatively influenced my perception of therapy as a whole. If I decide to pursue therapy again in the future, I will make sure to ask for or clarify their policy on this matter, and I will also use your policy as a model to compare to.

"Thank you, I really appreciate your empathetic and insightful message. Reading this genuinely makes me feel better. It’s so relieving to hear another person talk about therapists being “jumpy” because that’s exactly the type of therapist my last one was. Literally my last post here was about my therapist wanting to hospitalize me haha. 

But yeah, in response to your note about resilience, I do very much agree with you. It’s incredible how much pain one can undergo without having it show on the surface. Every day, I wonder how much more I’ll be able to endure and what my limit is, whether I’ll just eventually snap. The last several years have brought upon levels of pain and misery that I genuinely used to think I’d never have to experience in my life, but the fucked up part is that all I can think about is the fact that there are many people out there who are enduring even greater pain than I am, and that I don’t deserve to complain. That anyone else born in my position with my privileges would have turned out better and happier. That I’m simply not cut out to participate in society as a whole. Could I make any kind of logical or empirical argument for those statements?  Probably not, no, but it’s just what I was conditioned to believe. 

I greatly appreciate the advice as well. It very much seems to mirror what the other clinician commenter told me as well, regarding setting clear boundaries on what constitutes a serious situation. I am still just recoiling from the damage to my trust that this has taken on me and I’m not too sure how long it’ll take me to recover. 

Btw I really hope you can return to therapy soon. It’s a truly shitty reality that mental health is so expensive and isn’t just afforded to people as a right (assuming you live in the states). Maybe this is something you’re already looking into, but could I suggest possibly giving AI a shot? Trust me, I don’t have any kind of obsession with AI and I actually haven’t even tried AI therapy, but interestingly I’ve read quite a few positive things about it on reddit. Not ever going to be able to completely replace a real therapist in my opinion, but may have the potential to be a beneficial option when cost is a major consideration, based on my experience with AI capabilities for my own purposes."	jwappy9	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9983254075050354	weak	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
"No worries with rambles. Hurt sometimes makes us ramble because we can't express that feeling of hurting easily.

My other thought for you is to suggest you look for someone who comes from a trauma informed background.

I don't label myself as a trauma informed practitioner for a number of reasons but mainly because I can't point to a bit of paper that says I am. My supervisor says she finds that frustrating as I do it better than many trained folk.

What it means in practice is I don't leap in with suggestions and recommendations, but I will ask people about what things mean to them 

You mention living for your mom, I'd be asking you about the thinking and feelings behind that and exploring the values that represents. I am sure you can imagine this can trigger some strong feelings. I use the phrase ""my room is a safe place for feelings and I'm present here to help you process those feelings.""

Just recently a client had a flashback in the first 3rd of an intake appointment. After she got past the place where she couldn't speak, I got her to answer the question she raised around that event. Because she had already identified that one of the adults in the flashback was likely depressed, I could guide her to see that person with compassion.
We then jumped over most of the intake paperwork and I checked out she was feeling safe and we discussed who could be with her if this recall made her unsettled. I consented to put in the letter to her primary doctor and the surgeon we were doing the intake for that she had some trauma related to food.

She has messaged me since to let me know she has had a productive talk with a family member about that memory and knows it's not something she made up. She's started to see that this has affected some of her later choices. If I had either ignored or freaked out then she would have been left feeling like she wasn't safe.

When someone has a big flashback and gets stuck in the nonverbal place I consent through lifting a hand to do a bit of somatic work to get their body to move away from a full blown sympathetic nervous system blow out.
It's usually tapping or breathing together or some music. I always check if they need something like a hot drink after we get them verbal again to ground them further.

My own experience of having trauma informed therapy had me describe it like 14 rounds with a sumo wrestler. When I last accessed therapy, that person wasn't trauma informed  and I realised she didn't get that her ""solution"" (to leave the relationship) wasn't even on my radar. So I got a gym membership and lifted weights instead to manage a shitty situation where I was a secondary scapegoat.

My long ramble but I think the most valuable thing a therapist can do is create a space where we explore values and purpose"	jwappy9	reply	na	na	na	0.9983254075050354	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens

I'm 28M and I suffer from severe agitated depression as well as ADHD. I ran into this sub while googling Rexulti.

 I've been cycling through different treatments for the last 10 years or so trying to find something that sticks.

My new doctor has been slowly shifting me away from Vyvanse 70mg and Venlafaxine to different drugs to see what works.

Right now I've been off both for two weeks and I'm on Lexapro (20 mg) and Rexulti (1mg) with Bupropion XL 300mg to help with the side effects of not taking Vyvanse anymore. (After my electro-encephalogram results came in we were both scared at how blackish-red it looked and how agitated my frontal lobe and central parts of my brain were so he was thinking we could shift to drugs that weren't stimulants).

Problem is: I don't feel like doing absolutely anything. I no longer want to play video-games, I don't want to work, I don't want to have sex, I just want to lay in bed as I think about either dying or sleeping and this feels absolutely horrible.

It really isn't - the manufacturers of Abilify downplayed and undercounted incidence rates of movement disorders.

Interesting, ok. Please be sure to monitor yourself for any signs of a movement disorder while taking an antipsychotic.

I was on 150 XL for about 3-4 years (stopped on two occasions when pregnant and nursing). After a rough year, I went up to 300 XL. This was around November. Not sure I felt much a difference mood wise or energy wise but I swear I’ve gained weight mainly in my belly. I feel so bloated all the time. My diet and activity level hasn’t changed. In fact, I barely eat during the day and I’m constantly on my feet caring for my two young children. 

I don’t know if I should go back down to 150 XL or maybe try SR? All I know is I hate feeling this way and looking so bloated. When I first started on Wellbutrin, I felt great- energized and even lost a few pounds. I’m scared to stop because I do think it helps a little but I don’t like the way I look. Has anyone else experienced weight gain? Thoughts on switching to SR? Any advice is appreciated.

"A lot of people go through this. The only thing I have control over psychologically and physically/biologically is through running.

I started on the treadmill with a pace that push my heart rate. I’ve heard a lot of stories of people in deep depression who fought there way out through running and tried it myself.

It gives me hope that some day it would be better, it gave me a sense of progression and control over my own efforts to get better beyond a pill or therapy.

It’s one of those small victories that mental health experts commonly talk about. Giving our brains a sense of rewiring through repeat actions.

If I didn’t have my gym time. I would be trapped in my mind too much. There’s a mind body connection when it comes to depression. We are able to ground ourselves in the present moment.

I’m also forcing myself to take a road trip or fly somewhere different. So I can open up my mind to new experiences. I really don’t feel like it. But I’ve heard many people suggest in doing it— helping their mental health a bit.


Beyond that. Doctor Lembke “dopamine nation” (you can find her on YouTube) also mentions about our brain has a pain pleasure balance it needs to reach. When there’s too much pleasure (porn , gaming, tv or inactivity) our brain will be off balanced and drained. It requires progressive pain such as rigorous excerciise or learning or challenged for the brain to be functioning properly. We are biologically wired from thousands of human evolution to be active and in states of survival. We aren’t necessarily were born to be “HAPPY” but towards surviving and overcoming challenges (reproduction, or survive against tough environments)


DEPRESSION IS HARD in modern times. Without any manageable challenges , or too much comfort/pleasure/overstimulation or productive routines we sink into depression. We have to find ways to maintain our bodies to be ACTIVE, to have manageable / reasonable goals to work towards, and other things like human connection.

Getting out of the Negative Spiral and flipping the brain towards the upward spiral is VERY challenging and it takes time. We have to find small things that gives us rewards and making the brain feel like it’s achieving things. 

Viktor Frankl man’s search for meaning is powerful. Finding that meaning to live and building goals has helped me personally . I’m just focusing on learning a new career so I could help my mom and sister. Even I am numb and disconnected. It gives me something to work towards and a meaning to live.

Some people find that in helping others like volunteering at homeless shelters. Or learning skills that can help people.

I hope you find peace and strength on your journey.

"If you aren't in a complete acute and possible life threatening situation I'd probably start with one of those meds at a time to evaluate which one is helping and to minimize side effects.

Fluoxetine is a generally well tolerated antidepressant.

Olanzapine has a strong sedating component and can be used to augment effects of an antidepressant. Also it's effective in stopping ruminating thoughts.

Pregabalin can help with chronic pain and has anxiolytic properties.

I'm quite sure that combination can be of huge value if you are suffering from anxiety or agitated depression.

Edit: Just saw that your starting dose with fluoxetine is 20mg - that may lead to bowel cramps and abdominal pain. Depends if your sensitive to that kinda thing.

"i’ve tried lexapro, zoloft, viibryd, trintellix, cymbalta, wellbutrin, auvelity, adderal, ritalin, concerta, and gabapentin and gotten nowhere but worse. 

all of the ssris + the wellbutrin and auvelity have made me a lot more suicidal than i already am and give me side effects that make it impossible to even function. i’m already overweight so anything with weight gain associated it with it is already a no go for me as well as antipsychotics are something i’m not interested in trying as a mono therapy (my psych has pushed this since we started) as they can cause weight gain and increase blood sugar as well as risk some other terrible side effects that are sometimes irreversible. i’m just ready to give up"	MattDr02	post	19.53912860424721	female	White	0.999406099319458	na	na	na	104	depressionregimens

Your thyroid should be checked, but even if it isn't - try testosterone and T3. Thyroid meds are part of the depression trial.

"Clomipramine isn't too bad at low dosages and like MAOIs is among the most effective antidepressants out there. Tranylcypromine helped me lose quite a bit of weight and even increased my libido a bit. The diet is overblown. Thanks to improved food hygiene, far fewer foods have signficant amounts of tyramine now than they did in the past. I just had to give up excessive quantities of aged cheese and soy sauce and Chinese takeaway. It's worth it to not have anxiety (in my case). And it's not that hard to remember not to eat any SRIs or high doses of Adderal, is it? 😅 If you have serious depression, I wouldn't pass on tranylcypromine if it was offered, no matter how much I loved aged cheese. 😋

A very common finding on MAOIs is that unlike other antidepressants, people don't feel like they're on a drug. They tend to just feel normal, without the depression/anxiety.

"It took 9 goes to get my meds right and with menopause it stopped working and we were lucky we cracked it in one through some clever thinking by me and my GP.

My worry is that even within groups of meds you get a big variation of response. 

While fluoxetine and paroxetine stopped me feeling sad they also took out all pleasant emotions for me, escatalopram was lost the happy, kept the sad, and sertraline was ""did you prescribe be a placebo?""

My protocol for withdrawal created from a lot of hitting the textbooks (and thanking my first consultant for making me continue to read biochemistry research)has made fast switches in dose possible if unpleasant. 

Remission for me is having the right drugs so I can manage quality self care. And given how debilitating my lovely combination of anhedonia, suicidal ideation and oversleeping is, I'm pragmatic about trying everything under the sun.

Hi Katherine (I presume). Could you expand a little more on your experience? Dosing, timing, splitting doses etc? I can't tolerate tranylcypromine and EMSAM doesn't exist here - selegiline however is very easy to get. May I trouble you to discuss which aspects in terms of depression, anxiety, anhedonia/motivation etc you found it most addressed?

"Definitely try selegiline if you can. I couldn't tolerate nardil or parnate whatsoever because of the hypotension. I sure did try though. I spent a few months not being able to stand up for more than a few seconds at a time without falling or blacking out.

Selegiline brought me to a consistent 4/10 from my normal baseline which is like a 2-3/10. That included a slight benefit to mood and motivation. And by motivation I mean more like, a capacity to tolerate maybe. My anxiety definitely got worse as I was increasing my dose, but it eventually went away (or stopped being that little extra bad, rather).

For dosing I settled on six 5mg capsules upon waking and six 5mg capsules in the afternoon (around 2pm), for a total of 60mg daily. The dosing standards for selegiline (and other maois) were established a while ago and without treatment resistant depression in mind, so if it's tolerable, someone could definitely go higher than 60mg. I tried getting up to 80 but that was too much for me personally.

"Hi Katherine, that's extremely helpful - if that's clunky, I look forward to one of your eloquent answers :-)

TCP sends my BP through the roof and more or less turns me hypomanic - excessive NE/5HT vs what I need which is more of a push on the DA side.

One question if I may - I've explored higher dosing of selegiline, but what I've found is that large single doses (say like 30mg+) generate a very perceptible amphetamine style feeling for me - some euphoria etc. I've overused stimulants in the past (or maybe not just the past) to unknowingly medicate ADD/depression, and I find it tricky to deal with compounds which generate a phasic (short peaks) kind of response, as it can drive some behaviour changes in me such as getting into a mindset of thinking I need to add stimulants to get it done.

Originally when I first started bupropion, I had this very good steadily increased level of attention, energy, and focus - unfortunately it is not working quite the way it used to, hence the ongoing search to find something steady.

"I started taking medication for depression and adhd in september; started with adderall 10mg twice a day, then added wellbutrin 150 and upped adderall to 20mg twice a day. After a couple of months my psych upped the wellbutrin to 300mg, and then 2 months ago to 450, along with starting intuniv 1mg twice a day( i was also on lexapro for a few months but stopped because of complete emotional numbness).

So far, i think the Wellbutrin has helped with my mood and the adderall has helped with my ability to focus at work, but otherwise I’m constantly exhausted, my motivation is still rock bottom, and i no longer engage in any activities i enjoy; everyday i just go to work and then go home and sit in front of the computer until i go to sleep. I WANT to do things i enjoy, like going to concerts and playing video games, but when it comes time to do it, i just… can’t.

"I’ve been in a terrible state for just over 2 years. My trauma/PTSD was triggered by some ongoing difficulties my pre-teen daughter is having. I have been on Lexapro (ecitalopram) for 8 years but suddenly stopped working about 2 years ago. Was prescribed Venlafaxine/Mirtazapine combo which almost made me worse. Managed to quit Venlafaxine by cross-tapering to Paroxetine (6 weeks of pure Hell) and slowly tapering off Mirtazapine, after trying to stop it 3 times unsuccessfully. 

It’s been so, so hard as nothing seems to work and it’s frankly a miracle I’m still hanging on. It’s only because of the effect I know it would have on my children if I wasn’t here.

But one thing I’ve discovered makes a difference is missing a night of sleep. I discovered this by chance as one of the side-effects of coming off Mirtazapine is insomnia. Curiously, the next day I’m sort of back to my old self, not bouncing with joy, but ok but it only lasts until I sleep again. I’m endlessly stuck in a loop of waking with terrible panic, anxiety and SI, which lasts most of day till evening, when it abates a bit. The other thing I’ve found works is cold-water swimming which also seems to bring me back, if only for 1-2 hours. 

Does anyone know why these two things bring temporary relief? Could I have a cortisol/adrenaline/adrenal imbalance that’s somehow reset by lack of sleep/cold-water exposure?

DBT is a very helpful tool for anyone wanting to learn skills to help navigate life and make it worth living with a mental illness. It was created for borderline personality disorders, but it's shown to be effective for depression, OCD, patients with terminal illnesses, and more. It has some controversies, which I believe explains the downvotes, but trust me, I've seen hundreds of people excel and begin to heal through DBT skills.

I take 20mg Prozac for depression and 7.5 olanzapine as a antipsychotic as well as propranolol for anxiety as needed.  The anxiety is still there and hits me as soon as I wake up, sometimes lasting all day.  I worry about everything and put off stuff because of it.  It’s hard to feel and stay reassured and relaxed.  I depersonalize sometimes and get brain fog.  I find it hard to get motivated too and constantly worry and can have trouble connecting with others because of it.  I’d say my most calm moments are probably at night when the day is over.	Minute-Jello-1919	post	30.072689631061586	male	White	0.9967038035392761	na	na	na	1	depressionregimens

I just bought a VR headset and excersize/music app to go with it.  Game changer.  I have been getting up early and doing about 90 minutes Low Impact bat swinging and boxing to music.

"It has similarities to Nefazodone which is a weak SNDRI. It has low effect on dopamine, but the numbers on ansofaxine show a slightly less effect on dopamine.  By having an effect on all 3 neurotransmitters along with 5HT it provides very good efficacy along with a low side effect profile. It has less effect on serotonin which lessens sexual side effects, provides dopamine to help energy levels and motivation.  I have watch trials for SNDRI's and most of them fail at some point. I like to think of taking the positives of different classes of medications and putting them together with leaving the negative side effects behind.

"I mean, Gillman is not totally wrong functionally-speaking, and SNRIs are far from ideal; but then again duloxetine/cymbalta kept me alive for many years - and I definitely had shitty side effects, though tolerable.

And there's no doubt he's done essential work and saved lives, but I think we need to accurately observe the fact he's ""skeptical"", and not necessarily the leading expert in pharmacological development and what is going to work for everyone. All antidepressants have somewhat unpredictable trade-offs for many people, MAOIs being no exception, despite their amazing efficacy. I personally couldn't handle the diet/blood pressure/weight gain/slow-success-onset factors; or rather found they cancelled out the benefits.

Would love DRIs too, and being able to mixmatch with other meds (but then you run into a different kind of unpredictability). However, stimulants are already either being rationed or semi-shunned by clinicians due to the ""addiction"" plague in the USA. Unless they're explicitly for ""bodily"" health issues like Parkinson's (and I'm increasingly convinced ""mental"" overlaps enough with ""physical"" to not be worth distinction in some cases), companies probably are going to have harder times selling (to the FDA and public) anything that could potentially be abused.

I don't have a great answer for you, but I think there is increasingly going to be a need for basically ""Anything and all that works"", as many psychiatrists already recognize. And AI is going to work *FOR* mental health treatment, but simultaneously will make mental health worse for many.

I don't want to smother any hope on the matter (I wouldn't have posted ""promising results"" otherwise), but I also increasingly consider mental health to be its own pandemic, and all nations as wholes, especially the developed ones, will need to recognize that if they want to survive."

 Hello, I'm currently taking Anafranil 75mg for my OCD, and it's working even better than I expected. Although the recommended minimum dose for OCD is 100mg, I'm finding that 75mg is already helping me by about 90%. However, I've noticed that I don't feel a sense of urgency anymore. I constantly procrastinate and tend to put off tasks until tomorrow. This is causing me to worry about potentially being fired from my job because I always feel behind others and struggle to complete tasks. Additionally, I feel like I've become less intelligent compared to before. I have difficulty concentrating and lack motivation when reading, and even watching videos becomes challenging unless they get straight to the point. I may be panicking, but I can't shake these concerns, even though I've seen worse experiences on this subreddit.

" I have been gradually reducing my intake of Viibryd, but unfortunately, I am experiencing an exacerbation of my depression symptoms. It appears to be directly linked to the process of discontinuing Viibryd, wouldn't you agree? Since I have been depressed for the past three years, I didn't feel any noticeable benefits from taking Viibryd, which is why I decided to stop using it. However, I am currently still taking Wellbutrin.

I recently started seeing a new psychiatrist, but the initial prescriptions she provided haven't worked out well for me. She prescribed Luvox and modafinil, but I experienced significant feelings of derealization, prompting her to advise me to discontinue all medications. I'm hesitant about stopping Wellbutrin, though, and I need to clarify this matter with her.

Overall, I find it frustrating that doctors often lack a comprehensive understanding of my situation and resort to making educated guesses, which frequently lead to ineffective outcomes or intolerable side effects.

My primary concern at the moment is whether the increased depression I'm experiencing is a result of tapering off Viibryd or if it could be attributed to the side effects of the medications prescribed to me over the past three days. I'm feeling extremely down and overwhelmed, as these medications have failed to alleviate my depression, while the accompanying side effects have been extremely challenging to cope with. I'm at a loss regarding what steps to take next and I don't feel confident in my new doctor's ability to provide suitable guidance.

"Background is the usual tried everything, nothing works, have tried over 20 meds, SSRIs, SNRIs, every Atypical, Mood Stabilizers, Anticonvulsants, yada yada. 

Had a psychiatrist visit yesterday and I showed up like ""Yeah, I'm just stumped, I'm maxed out on everything and don't feel any better"" and she has been bringing up a cross taper to Trintellix a lot. She mentioned that Trintellix isn't in the formulary and I would have to get special approval, but didn't say what that entailed other than a nurse would have to call me back a few days later. I didn't like the idea of fucking around with non formulaic stuff because I'm not exactly rolling in cash. I remembered that she usually follows up mentions of Trintellix with Viibryd, which has a generic by now and is formulaic, so I asked for that instead. And she was cool with either so we opted for the Viibryd.

And I'm just wondering if I should have opted for Trintellix instead. I mean I guess nobody can say for sure, since I'm so far gone now that psychiatry in my case is just going ""Fuck it, let's try it and see if it works"". I didn't do the research beforehand but it seems like Trintellix works on a lot more stuff than Viibryd.

Current meds if it matters are

Wellbutrin 450mg (Trintellix has an interaction with this but Viibryd does not)

Remeron 30mg (cross tapering with viibryd)

Viibryd 10mg

Propranolol 20mg (for essential tremors)

If you were to improve your gut microbiome, would this affect how the meds operate? 

Given that 70% of Serotonin is created in the gut, and if you happen to eat a poor diet, you're not getting nearly close to that 70% because it hinges on your gut microbiome being in great working condition.  


So, if you were to really improve your diet and focus on your gut microbiome, I wonder how that would affect the meds ability to process serotonin, if at all.  I've been trying to improve my gut health recently ( I eat fairly well ), but I'm trying to do a restart on my system.

">If you were to improve your gut microbiome, would this affect how the meds operate?

I think there's too much emphasis on the gut microbiome as an entity divorced from the *myriad* biological functions taking place that are fuelled by our nutrition. Many people find their medication works better, for example, if they supplement with a methyl donor like creatine. Others have suboptimal levels of vitamin levels of B6 which is required to produce GABA and dopamine and those neurotransmitters play a huge role in depression. We're learning that low levels of serotonin is too simplistic a model to address the multivariate nature of depression. On the  other hand, including more nutritious foods and improving your gut health can only be a good thing but many people only experience partial remission with dietary changes alone."	squaresam	reply	na	na	na	0.9951868653297424	no	strong	strong	na	depressionregimens

What it says in the title. I had a massive nervous breakdown 20 months ago, then a nightmare year of disastrous medication tinkering by a psychiatrist who didn’t know what the f she was doing. I’ve been back on Prozac, which she really should never have taken me off of, for the last six months, and have been tapering down/off of lamotrigine for four months and feel much more like myself. I slipped a disc six months ago as well but that’s healing and I can do a lot of the physical things I haven’t been able to do since November. And it’s springtime, the days are longer, it’s sunny, I’ve managed to complete deadlines that a few months ago I didn’t think I would be able to given the brain fog, my book won an award, last week I got a job offer, and I have another interview coming up (there are NO jobs in my industry atm so this is a pretty big deal). My husband is wonderful, the puppy we adopted four months ago is a dream. And yet I can’t drag myself out of bed because being awake just doesn’t feel worth it. My mood throughout the day improves and by evening I feel happy, but in the morning I genuinely don’t see the point of anything.

"I've heard it's very hard to reach toxicity levels with Vitamin D3. It takes somewhere around 60,000IU a day for months on end to reach toxicity levels, but that's an absolutely insane amount. 

I take 10,000 IU a day and that's a lot, but my bloodwork still shows I was at the low end of the optimal range for D3 even on 5,000IU.

If you're at a northern latitude, during winters, it's not uncommon to have to take 5,000IU during the winters to get to normal levels.

Helps to get your blood tested beforehand to know what your levels are, B12 and magnesium are two other things to look out for. I found out a few years ago that I had a B12 deficiency despite eating plenty of meat, my doctor couldn't really figure out why.

Like /u/Quirky_Friend said, a SAD lamp can also help with energy, even in the summers. Shoot for a rating of 10,000 lux at the minimum--also make sure you're placing it in the proper orientation, at a proper distance/angle to you, as this matters a lot. Half an hour to an hour in the morning after you wake up is a good place to start.

"Fully agree on that.  
I have taken 60k units per day for some weeks (days counted!) to ramp up on a specific level. Worked pretty fine, landed on spot.

With repeated tests I can prove \_FOR ME\_:  
with 14k/day my level sinks  
with 20k / day my level raises.  
So my intake is 17k and I am fine with a level of \~90ng.

I’m not sure what to do right now. I have agitated depression and I’ll go through random spells where I am an impossible human. I’ll start off by saying I do better when I’m by myself but I’m not alone tonight. Overwhelming sadness mixed with severe agitation. My husband has been out of town for work and he’s back this weekend and everything he does is pissing me off. From simply breathing to noises when he’s eating. My cats keep licking themselves and it’s sending me over the edge. I’m trying so fucking hard not to snap because I am completely aware no one deserves this from me. But yet I feel so out of control of my emotions. My husband asks what he can do and I don’t have any answers. He is so worried. I feel terrible about it. I’m bawling in the living room by myself out of complete frustration. I am so so frustrated with myself, I want to badly to be normal. To be able to enjoy time with my husband and snuggle with my animals but I am so fucking on edge. I can’t sit still, I feel like I can’t breathe, nothing it calming me down. What helps you guys? I need something quick. I thought about taking a sleeping pill and trying to just sleep it out. I also thought about going for a drive but I don’t want to freak my husband out with worry.

"I’m a recovering alcoholic and have been sober now for 2 months. (Not by choice, but because I have been forced into it, and I don’t want to be homeless.)

I am miserable without my daily numbing with alcohol. 

I have had 2 suicide attempts this year, all fueled by blacked out boozy benders.
Being in 2 psych hospitals has traumatized the absolute shit out of me, and I am still recovering over that. The first facility did nothing but increase my buspar(which never did anything for me), and the second place which was even scarier just had me start Abilify in addition to my SNRI.

I did an outpatient program afterwards, and then got my meds changed once again.

I’ve been on every SSRI, Buspar, Cymbalta, Abilify, Gabapentin, you name it.
The restlessness and ravenous hunger from abilify was so bad that I got switched to Vraylar. 
Vraylar was okay, but when it was increased to 5MG, it made me super restless again. 

They bumped up my Pristiq to 100mg, decreased my Vraylar back to 1.5MG, and increased the Gabapentin and I feel fucking terrible.
I cry everyday and just want to drink in peace. 
All of my privacy has been stripped from me so that I cannot buy alcohol, and I am treated like a child at my ripe old age of 35 years. I am so miserable and tired of every day feeling like the movie Groundhog Day. Work, eat, watch tv, sleep, repeat X5.

What other psych meds could even help me at this point? 
I am willing to do anything and just want relief. 
Sometimes I think I just might end up out on the streets because alcohol is the only thing that brings me happiness and takes away my problems.

Sorry for the long rant, I am just at a loss for words these days and have been through a lot of trauma. 
Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated."	anxietypoodle	post	29.128035885751544	female	White	0.9976931214332581	na	na	na	42	depressionregimens
"Ketamine may be an option (or psilocybin if you’re in Oregon). These specifically have seen success in treating addiction. 

In my experience, antidepressants and alcohol aren’t a great mix. It’s possible that some or all of the treatments you’ve tried were at least somewhat impacted by alcohol use. I’m also finding that whatever depression treatment I’m on, it seems to work way better if I’m not drinking, not having more than a cup of coffee’s worth of caffeine, eating at least semi-decently, sleeping ok, and exercising. I’m not saying that going for a run will cure your depression, just that I think the treatments work better on a relatively healthy body. For me, even one drink is sometimes enough to put me into a terrible mood.

Not saying you have to do all this stuff at once.  You have a lot going on right now and over-extending probably won’t help. I’m just saying that as you progress in your recovery, you might have more options than you think.

I’ve had some hellish experiences quitting meds, but they were due to me being an idiot and just trying to go cold turkey. Even then, the bad part doesn’t last forever.

I think making the decision to switch meds is always worth it as long as you’re not in crisis right now. You know yourself better than anyone, if you don’t think something’s working, I don’t think there’s a reason to stick with it.

If anything, just making a decision to switch meds lifts my depression a little because it’s recognizing that there’s other things to try and I have choices.

"As someone who is currently in quite a heavy doses of meds combination, and for over 1.5 years went through countless different trials and errors like a test rat, here couple of things I will add:

1. The antidepressants take a long time to adjust with our bodies, because the doses that are given are quite low and needs to buildup enough to the point it puts the chemical in a ""normal"" level. So you check the medications and their time to work. 

2. Most of the antidepressants has withdrawals if you stop taking them suddenly. That is why the doses are gradually decreased until they're stopped completely. 

3. All different medications have different types of side effects and responses to our symptoms are also different. So when introduced new meds ask specifically what type of side effects you should be looking for. Like the time I was put on Clofranil and I got severe constipation that I never experienced before. Within a 7-10 days I pressed my doctor to remove that specific one. And the moment I stopped taking it the side effects were gone. 

4. If you think the prescription and all the changes to it is not particularly helping you, go for second opinion. Modern medical science is very new and different professionala have different philosophies of treating their patients. Unfortunately we as a sufferer have to walk a fine line of trust and skeptism. We have to trust their prognosis but also our own body. For example the first doctor I went to see, they wanted to give me very small doses and switching to different medications and when that's working again going back to the old one. Like somehow they had one school of thought but wasn't sure herself whether it works for me or not. They encouraged me to take second opinions. After first such opinion I went back to their but they still didn't understand fully how to deal with me. Finally the person they referred who has completed different school of thought just throw old prescription into the bin and put me in a new prescription that just worked like they said it would! 

What you said about the trial period, is absolutely correct. It's a very difficult phase and to hold on to nothing, fighting depression and all the different changes these meds bring is just horrible. We hear all the time about seeking professional helps for mental health issues all the time. But nobody tells how difficult the treatment process is, and then all through this we are supposed to live life like nothing is going on. I think most horrible is the question people around me keep asking, when I am going to be off the medications, like it's an antibiotic treatment. I hope you find the right solution. All the best."

"> Anyway has anyone else gotten off their meds and been okay?

For depression the meds never worked, so either I would not notice any difference if I took them or not, or I would get worst with them, and when I stopped them I would stop feeling even worse because of them. So I took and also stopped them completely a certain number of times when I was depressed. 

And when I found something that I was certain that was working (which was meditating a lot), then I stopped the meds and never took them again."	Evening_Attention_45	reply	na	na	na	0.999483585357666	no	strong	strong	na	depressionregimens

"Right now I'm only on Valdoxan (one of the lightest antidepressants) and Spravato, which is a newer treatment that isn't supposed to last forever. I don't think they ever worked as intended, so I decided to take the route of treating my ADHD - which was diagnosed last year -, and if Vyvanse works, I intend to stop antidepressants altogether. To some people, they're more trouble than they're worth, and unfortunately I fall into this category. There are much newer types of antidepressants being developed right now, though, to the point that SSRIs are taking the backseat as first-line treatments, so I wouldn't lose hope yet. Maybe future releases of NMDA receptor antagonists or psychedelics will work for you (I still intend to stay away from antidepressants if ADHD treatment works, they were traumatic to me). 

However, I can offer another piece of advice. If none of the meds are working for you, please keep testing, and I don't mean just blood draws. There are many issues that cause dysphoria or outright mimic depression, but a psychiatrist or GP is more likely to diagnose you with an affective disorder straight away. I had a very descriptive paper that detailed many of the possible organic dysfunctions that could lead to a MDD diagnosis, but I can't find it - I'll make sure to post it here if I do. Not to mention that ADHD itself is known to cause lack of motivation, emotional dysregulation and Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, but many physicians will fail to inform you this because some of these symptoms aren't listed on the DSM-V.

That is to say that the answer to your problems might not be in an antidepressant, but rather a stimulant, dietary supplementation, hormonal therapy etc. Just keep going.

Unfortunately, I know how this can be challenging if you live in the US - my country doesn't have the same health insurance problems, and it's not even first world -, but I still think improving your mental health is worth some bills."

"2 months and a half. Spravato has an effect that no other antidepressant had on me, which is eliminating almost completely the suicidal ideation and catastrophizing. I don't know how it works because there are only a few studies, but I suspect it stimulates the glutamate receptors, which in turn release more neurotransmitters in a quicker, but less damaging way than most antidepressants. It hasn't really changed my behavior, but I was in a dark state and it helped me discuss some things in therapy and bond with my family (I go to the sessions with my mom, and we got very close during the dissociation period). However, going to the appointments 2 days a week and spending 2+ hours in the hospital is a chore. Considering traffic, it takes half a day, and if my parents weren't retired, I wouldn't be able to attend. Also, it has a lot of cognitive side effects in the days after. I feel agitated, impatient and very unfocused (I can barely read entire paragraphs, and English isn't my first language so I get confused a lot, even though normally I read it better than my first language), which is hazardous considering that I have ADHD and I'm still trying to get my degree. The side effects usually go away after 5 days or so, and are probably more noticeable in me than in neurotypical people because I have untreated ADHD. In the end, I consider Spravato a very efficacious treatment for immediate depression, but I think I'll ask my new doctor to stop the sessions this week so I can focus on my ADHD. In my case, depression was probably a subproduct of ADHD (which according to my neuropsychologist, I masked through all these years), so I have my reasons to believe that Vyvanse will work better than any antidepressant, especially now that my suicidal ideation is at a minimum and I developed better coping mechanisms to discomfort. Also, Spravato is very expensive, even though my insurance here in Brazil covers all the costs. But don't let any of my impressions stop you from starting treatment, it's mostly a positive experience and certainly more fruitful than regular antidepressants. An ignored aspect of the s-ketamine experience is that you can have very ""revealing"" realizations while you're dissociating (which by the way fades in intensity after the first weeks, especially if you control your anxiety during the sessions), almost like a quick therapy session, and it has helped me solve long-term problems. Big problems that I had a few years ago, like relationship hyperfixation and mild body dysmorphia, seem small right now. Not to mention that the relaxing feeling you have after the session is incomparable, I have a delayed circadian rhythm and I sleep like a baby without feeling sedated for a whole day."

A lot of people speak of getting more depressed during menstruation, I occasionally do maybe a week before my period however most of the time when I’m on my period I feel less depressed. I still get negative emotions such as sadness or anxiety and cry, however I’m still FEELING emotions whereas I’d usually feel numb, and I also feel feelings of motivation and a sense of power like I wanna do 200 pushups/fight a bear and dance, food tastes better too and music sounds better and I want to do hobbies I usually put of like art and music. Why is this??? What hormonal fluctuation is the cause of it? I wish I knew a means of sustaining these feelings.

"Bear in mind that you probably won't get answers from psychiatrists or mental health researchers here, so take everything with a grain of salt. As far as I know, there's no consensus about the mechanisms of depression and anxiety. Even last year, a well-publicized paper was released contesting the role of serotonin on depression. What IS known is that antidepressants have a better response rate than placebo, that's how people know they work. However, even if you know someone's genetics, it's not clear how a specific drug will work on a particular individual. Some people will relate a mood-lifting effect while others with similar metabolisms will feel ""dampened"" when using the same drug. 

The newest approved drugs, like s-ketamine and Auvelity, seem to work better than SSRIs and other types of antidepressants that target the serotonin system, but they're not without their inconveniences (s-ketamine is administered in 2 hour guided sessions and causes dissociation), and studies discussing them are unfortunately much harder to find. In my opinion, they are more effective because they trigger the action of many neurotransmitters at once, but it becomes difficult to trace the root of the problem - and Spravato somehow worsens my ADHD symptoms the days after I take it, even though it keeps suicidal ideation at bay. I don't know much about psychedelics, but there are studies that indicate depression relief when properly used.

""Motivation"" is a big word, not only related to depression and anxiety, and it's very difficult to say what kind of medication works best. Hormonal issues, such as hypogonadism, can cause lack of motivation, so can ADHD (which is typically treated with stimulants and CBT), cyrcadian rhythm disorders, drug abuse, abnormal levels of certain minerals/vitamins in the blood etc. 

In the end, the medication route is still predominantly trial-and-error. However, there are MANY organic problems that can cause dysphoric feelings, and psychiatrists are known to ignore them. Being thoroughly tested - not only with a blood draw - is a good idea, because some people will experience a relief on their depression/anxiety through hormone therapy, diet supplementation, neurostimulants etc. instead of regular antidepressant medications."

I had a bad depressive episode this past week, despite being relatively stable for about a year.  My brain felt like I had been crying for hours and hours, but I haven’t been crying.  My brain feels tight or swollen, I feel depressed and my body feels like a shell, or an empty vehicle.   I hate this feeling and it took several days to go away like a brutal hangover.  Actually,  that’s the best way to describe the head feeling…like a very dull hangover.   How do I get rid of this feeling quicker?

"I am suffering from deep depression and generalised anxiety for more than a decade. Only recently I seek out medical assistance. After over a year worth of trial and error, changing doctors, I finally got a combination of medication that is actually working. My doses are probably quite high and consist of quite a long list of different compositions. Apart from my sexual drive I actually doesn't have any more issues. I can function completely fine, take social and work projects easily, look after me and loved ones, do daily chores and work regularly. One can say I'm doing much better than people without my conditions. But there's a lot to improve which may not be exactly directly related to my conditions or symptoms but I am taking small steps everyday I believe. 

Recently due to some family emergency, I had to endure a lot mentally and physically. And after it resolved, I am having a short of burn out. I talked to my doctor two days ago. Explained my conditions, he said everything is completely fine and it's okay to feel burn out when subjected to external stress. I agree with him objectively but back in my head I have this nagging fear of a relapse. It happened to me before, where after two months of recovery without any reason everything collapsed and I spiralled into the darkest phase of my depression.

But one thing I am having a difficult time to understand. During my last appointment, I explained to my doctor that how I feel like I am in autopilot and somewhere I am not able to feel things like I used to before. Like floating in a steady stream but not getting wet. When there's a deadline I can't feel the stress or anxiety I used to have earlier and I feel uncomfortable. My doctor said this is because now my emotions are in control and I have much more capacity to take any outside trigger. But still it makes me feel like something is off about me, or I'm more like a machine now who can't actually feel anything.

Does this is how people without depression or anxiety feels? Or my coping mechanism is so ingrained in my brain that now when I don't have anything to feel anxious about I can't exactly know how to process everything? Or is this side effects of the medications?"	carefullycalculative	post	24.70978022197354	female	White	0.005535386968404055	na	na	na	4	depressionregimens
Do you have a therapist as well? I found that I needed regular check ins with a therapist as well as the right combination of medicines. It’s ok to be afraid of a relapse, I often am as well. I found that my doctor was more willing to prescribe what I wanted when I had an anxiety treatment plan with a therapist. She recommended a prescription medicine, the doctor made it happen. (Most therapists/mental health counselors don’t have a license to prescribe in the US.) You sound conscientious, brave and hard working. I’m sorry you have had this crisis, I hope you and your family will be ok. Talking to a professional who is outside of your situation can be a great relief. May be he or she could help you evaluate your medications vs the good things you can learn to do in order to calm yourself?

"I suspected when I was a child because I was hyperactive and had a hard time studying anything I wasn't immediately interested, but I didn't think it was that big of a deal and couldn't handle the Ritalin crash. Years later, after I changed my psychologist for the 5th time, she happened to have ADHD and considered an evaluation first thing as I wasn't responding to antidepressants at all (they just seemed to numb me), and while it's not as divulged, ADHD has a lot of symptomatic overlap with depression, anxiety and even disorders like BPD (individuals with ADHD can have mild rejection sensitive dysphoria). 

I'm also taking twice the time to graduate college despite having better scores than my peers when I'm allowed to work on my own - it's just that my overall performance is brought down by my lack of motivation and attendance issues. So I went to a neuropsychologist, she did some tests and pretty much confirmed that I have mixed ADHD. I still didn't treat it for a few months, though, because my ex-doctor said that my anxiety and depression were too high and I needed to focus on these first.

However, the only drug that seemed to help with my dysphoric symptoms was esketamine, which also seems to exacerbate some ADHD-related symptoms like racing thoughts, impatience, inattention etc., so I went to three different psychiatrists and they all seemed to agree that I ignored my ADHD for too long and that all of my symptoms can be accounted to untreated adult ADHD. I'm really hoping that my experience with Vyvanse will be good. I'm actually betting on it. You can find other stories like mine on YouTube if you search for ""adult ADHD"", it's not that uncommon to be misdiagnosed with depression and anxiety until your late 20s or even later."

"Hey all,

Long story short I have ADHD and take Adderall and I believe they are actually raising my libido. I also take pristiq and back when I started it was actually one of the reasons I chose it, aside for knowing that it's a drug type works good for me, was because it is not known to affect libido. But now I really want the reverse...

My girlfriend used to really enjoy sex. But now with some changes in situation it's not so much. Maybe once a week, sometimes less. And those don't seem to come easy. If I do put effort in and seem to charm her or whatever, honestly my head is working overtime thinking that she really doesn't even want to be doing this and I can't either perform or finish. This is even if I take medicine for that particular situation - The problem is not physical it is mental and me thinking she doesn't want to even be here which completely takes me out of the situation and ability to finish. At this point it's really starting to wreck my life and pumping up my depression and anxiety greatly. Even seems to make my ADHD meds work less.

So to my question, is there something I can take, maybe something I can replace the Pristiq with, that will just hose my libido and the desire for sex? I know this is the opposite of what most people want and are asking for, but at this point it's really the only answer I can see to give me some peace.

"Diagnosed with ASD, ADHD (which a psychiatrist later said was uncertain), GAD, social anxiety, MDD, and some psychs have suggested BPD or AvPD. 

Been unhappy my whole life basically but the last year it has gone worse. A new symptom the last year is anhedonia especially anticipatory anhedonia. Currently I’d say that anhedonia and GAD are my main problems. 

I’ve been on 4 SSRIs, duloxetine, and some other ineffective ADs, in addition to trials with ADHD meds. After a long break from SSRIs, my GP started me on 37.5 mg venlafaxine 4 weeks ago. It’s not going well. I’m very sensitive to many psych meds. On venlafaxine, I have a constant jittery and uneasy (“electrical” ish) feeling in my body, my thoughts are more scattered (which was already a problem), I wake up with my heart racing in the morning, and difficulty with orgasm. I know four weeks is early. But I was already hesitant to try yet another SSRI/SNRI after many failed trials, and I think there’s a considerable nocebo effect at play. I hate myself for accepting another med in more or less the same class, and I’m demoralized. 

The only thing that can ease my anxiety is 5mg ritalin (and benzos but can’t get them).  The effect varies a lot however. Sometimes it can change my whole outlook on my life, so that everything seems uncomplicated and straightforward. Sometimes it doesn’t work that well, but it always quits my mind to some degree. But I doubt my GP will refill the script given my ADHD diagnosis has been cast into doubt by one psych. 

Has anyone had the same jittery experience with venlafaxine? Or the same effect of ritalin? 

I’m ready to give up the venlafaxine. I just can’t do another six months with dose adjustments only to give up which is what happened with the other SSRI/SNRIs (except escitalopram many years ago but it pooped out eventually). 

I’m considering asking for pregabalin, I’m at a point where I at least need to get rid of my anxiety quickly. Would ideally like an MAOI given my positive response to ritalin (and the inferred positive effect of dopamine) but I’m pretty sure I’d never get it.

On the other hand, I feel like no psychiatrist has ever really tried to work out how to optimize treatment. I’ve never tried to combine long and short acting for instance. Never been allowed a short acting amphetamine, at least to just test it out. I’ve been to psych after psych, having diagnoses changed back and forth, and at my latest GP visit when I brought up my uncertain ADHD diagnosis he said stimulants only works for children so they can get an education.

It's great for tracking the impact of a new drug. My main theme from boosting my venlafaxine with Wellbutrin is that I need to plan to take time to decide on work contracts as I'm too impulsive taking on work because of my money anxiety. While Wellbutrin stimulating it's a double edged sword.

What I do know is I don’t qualify for any significant help in terms of therapy and I now think medication is more likely to give me dementia than help me, it’s just a placebo that everyone makes me take because that’s the only thing that makes other people think I’m trying to get better	t5yy6	reply	na	na	na	0.9967144727706909	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"I don't have any answers sorry just wanted to say I extremely relate. It's intensely frustrating and can feel so hopeless. 

I'm trying to investigate and improve my physical health & improve my life circumstances in general (difficult when just engaging in life requires more labor and less benefits than your average person), to see where that gets me. Ofc I'm doing things for mental health as well, read a lot about trauma & coping skills. But have been limited in my help by therapies w professionals, and I have trouble getting any positive effects from medicines like I see you also experience from one of your posts. 

Cannabis can give me some amazing & ofc limited benefits. When I haven't consumed some in a while I cry from finally feeling some positive stimulation/enjoyment, more pro social feelings, etc. Again it's limited & there's plenty of negative side effects.

The most effective treatment that worked for me involved the undertaking of a high dose stimulant along with a Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitor (SSRI), and a Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). This involved a combination of the following.

* Ritalin/Concerta, or Modafinil.

"I have to ask and sorry to be blunt, but did you experience trauma as a child? 
It might not be physical, in my experience those with psychological abuse and neglect are often worse off because there are no scars 
I'm posting this link about Adverse Childhood Experiences so you can see the scope.
https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/aces/index.html
If this is the case you need to get into therapy with someone who knows about and understands trauma in childhood.
It's not an easy or quick fix but it is often the missing piece when things haven't worked.
I'm fortunate that I have one drug that worked until menopause and now a combination of two is doing OK, along with being on the right hormone therapy.
My first depressive episode was probably in my early teens, but I did a lot of daydreaming and eventually got out the other side. My second was at 17 and I really didn't do well at school that year.
It took until my early 30s with an exceptional psychiatrist who realised I was talking total sense about trying the then rather new SNRI called Effexor to see if it would help me.

"Listening to doctors, the most rational of them.

Taking meds.

Doing therapy and talking to people who are able to listen, not friends who will give you bad advice and their opinion.

Being able to make compromises about what you can do. For example being alone because of depression is not easy but it makes it easier to manage, and it can help. Not wanting a job.

Being with people who can understand and accept the illness. Hearing people who are skeptical of a diagnosis will stigmatize you and deal big blows to your self esteem.

Managing your lifestyle regarding physical activity and food etc, meaning doing the minimum. Stopping smoking, drinking etc.

Finding a routine of things that you enjoy doing despite losing the taste of life.

Generally major depression does come in episodes that resolve but constant depression like this especially from early age would make me want to investigate possibilities of trauma, OCD, bipolar disorder, untreated ADHD, and rule out psychotic disorders as well.

"I really just got very into K-pop specifically bts. Finding music i really enjoyed gave me lots of good chemicals like dopamine probably. Seeing music I related to helped me be seen. Going to concerts was refreshing and helped me make new friends. It motivated me to work so I can go to more concerts. The fun outfits and hair inspired me to find my own style. I even tried to learn to dance and a new language.

Other interests like anime also helped me want to learn to draw and video edit more, although watching anime was still more passive. Now that I’m back into it again, I’m learning to draw more. I’m considering trying to write fanfic as well. 

Basically an interest spurring more hobbies and interests. I think people underestimate how much healthy dopaminergic activities like music, dancing, concerts and socializing can help your brain. Dopamine helps neuroplasticity and helps the brain grow. I bet all the dopamine I got from this stuff helped me unlearn all the depressing stuff I believed in childhood, like that I’m not good at socializing or something when I was.

Unfortunately I ended up becoming very depressed anyways, but I feel these hobbies kept me afloat through that, and definitely made me much happier before I became more severely depressed. 

I kind of wish I found it earlier and younger so that my brain could grow better. I had no dopaminergic activities so I think this lead to the development of chronic depression and adhd symptoms in adulthood."	t5yy6	reply	na	na	na	0.9967144727706909	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
So I do the at-home therapy that costs $300/month, including the medication. They don’t accept insurance and I’m currently looking for a provider, like a regular psychiatrist, who is willing to prescribe so that I can use my insurance. My family helped me pay for the first six months of treatment. $300 is still a lot of money every month, but it’s not like the thousands you could spend for in-office IV treatment, and every penny has been worth it so far. I’d look at r/TherapeuticKetamine because there’s an FAQ portion that could answer a lot of your questions.

"Howdy, I'm a 30yo male, long suffering with anxiety and depression.

Around 2y ago I restarted a regime I did in my late teens, mirtazapine/remeron 25mg. This was to address a poor self esteem, but I had a (barely) functional social life.

I was struggling with focus and concentration at work and caught wind of ADHD, learned a lot about it and went through an assessment battery. Started on Vyvanse which definitely helped with the these issues at work.

But I was still feeling pretty anxious and self critical, I was upped to 50mg mirtazapine.

Much the same, I asked the psychiatrist if I could try something different, he put me on 50mg pristiq/deslenafexine.

Since getting onto it, I've felt increasingly apathetic and lazy. I've progressively spent more and more time in bed each day, I've stopped socialising all together, I avoid calls from friends, I just don't have the energy to care. I don't hit low lows, I just don't give a shit about anything. 

Each time I've seen him he's upped my dose of pristiq.  He thinks it's the mirtazapine, or symptomatic of depression itself. I'm now on 150mg pristiq, going to 200mg. I kinda feel like I'm beating my head against a wall here. I don't know how more of the same is going to help, but hey he's the doctor. The mirtazapine definitely zonked me when I started, but at least I could keep up appearances. Since starting pristiq I'm literally doing nothing with myself. 

Recap:

- 50mg mirtazapine
- 40mg vyvanse
- 200mg pristiq

"I've been taking pristiq for the past 2.5 months.. only up to 50mg, but I'm quite sensitive to medication.  It has definitely made me pretty blunted compared to other meds I've taken.  It has helped my anxiety/attention/memory a decent bit (feels very noradrenic compared to cymbalta)... but I've been a bit harsher to people at times and feel myself getting a bit less social.

Re: Doctors.. I've seen about 20 different MD psychiatrists over the past 20 years... most of them are average/mediocre/bad (pretty much by definition).  The 2 that have really impressed me I've had long relationships with.  I find that most psychiatrists are pretty bad at listening to the patient, empathizing, and trusting that what you're feeling is in fact your lived experience.  I've had a lot of psychs that honestly scare me with how incompetent they are... can't imagine some of them dealing with someone in really bad shape.  

It's good to be methodical about medications.. but trust your gut if you feel like increases in a medication are making things worse.

"Hey guys, 

I recently watched a remarkable video with the researcher Lisa A. Pan on refractory depression. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeJEoMNwlj0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeJEoMNwlj0)

In the video (7:56 min) Pan describes the case of a person with very treatment-refractory depression (no benefit from MAOI, stumulants, lithium etc.) and suicidal behavior who got treated with the enzyme cofactors tetrahydrobiopterin (trade name ""Kuvan"") and achieved remarkable improvements in depression and functioning. Pan stresses that the findings are preliminary. Just in case you are interested: The medication ""Kuvan"" is ridiculously expensive (US$100,000 per year). At least until the patent rights are valid. 

You can find the case study refered in the video here:  

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3116226/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3116226/)

I had never heard of tetrahydrobiopterin or about the metabolic conditions that it is supposed to treat. Exciting to see that extensive research has been done on the connection between depression and tetrahydrobiopterin for decades: 

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278584622001257?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278584622001257?via%3Dihub)

Besides tetrahydrobiopterin there exist also other related enzyme cofactors such as neopterin or biopterin?  Any ideas how these could be utilzed as cheaper alternatives to ""Kuvan""? What are your general thoughts on the topic?"	InanimateSteelRod	post	35.983817335611604	female	White	0.002916232217103243	na	na	na	10	depressionregimens

"A difficult conversation to have as there is very few things capable of increasing BH4 significantly.

There is NOS enzymes which apparently “spare” BH4 from being used up in the process to create Nitric Oxide. 

There is high doses of oral BH4 which do not often work as it is not orally bioavailable, or has very low oral bioavailability. 

There is exercise, it increases BH4 substantially for a short duration. 

There is high doses of Vitamin C, or megadoses depending on your definition. Typically above 3,000mg. 

There is the option of testing BH4 via X-ray guided spinal tap. If it comes back low it can be provided by government or by private insurance. It is designed to treat phenylketonuria (PKU) so most countries will have patients on this medication.

Edit: I forgot about precursors and cofactors for BH4. You need to support the folate and BH4 cycle with B-vitamins. If using folate preferably not a high dose close to 1mg as the folate cycle also uses an enzyme that synthesises BH4."

"Indeed difficult. There are at least several other chemicals/substances/techniques which can effectively ""treat"" TRD/D2TD, but as mentioned and you said, they're either prohibitively expensive, poorly metabolized/poorly bioavailable, addictive and require progressive doses (opioidergic/dopaminergic), not enough concentrated effort/funding, or difficult to access in the brain/body (deep brain stimulation). 

It's so fucking frustrating, especially for people who suffer from more of inherent ""biological"" depression/anhedonia vs situational stressors, that we have strong ideas about what is wrong, but no means to treat it efficiently. 

The nitric oxide mention piqued my interest slightly. I've probably mentioned it on the sub before, but I have a nose/nerve/functional disorder called Empty Nose Syndrome (turbinates removed, and for most they are necessary, especially for certain ethnicities in colder/dry climates as they help warm and humidify the air). Basically everyone who knows anything about fitness or physiology, knows that nasal breathing is the best. Not just for exercise but for resting/enjoyment (sympathetic vs parasympathetic). NO Is produced in the sinuses by nasal breathing, and patients with ENS have been tested to have lower levels of NO. 

What's particularly interesting is that NO helps synthesize various neurotransmitters (obviously implicated in MDD/GAD/PTSD/pain, etc.), and actually standalone is necessary for optimal function of various bodily processes and sensations e.g. getting and maintaining an erection, delivering/creating sufficient energy for muscle function in exercise.

Aside from just being a big deal potentially on its own, not only would anything that would detract from NO production be something to consider or target in treating MDD, but we can further observe and analyze a sort of interconnectivity and cascade of dysfunction caused by a deficiency in one particular chemical, amino acid, hormone, etc. e.g. people with hypothyroidism feeling depressed/cold, shitty microbiome in colon blah blah.

This is all to say that BH4/NO may have a bidirectional relationship (and tbh I'd never heard of BH4 prior to this post; I'm just hypothesizing the connection and compounded role in MDD). It is also suggesting that we may be able to (continually) treat mental illness from different ""angles"" - perhaps similar to how antidepressants help manage HPA Axis dysfunction, though they don't ""FIX"" it. This reasoning is a big factor in my decision to get the VNS implant to treat not only my mental illness, but functional/""bodily"" processes: it emphasises the brain and body are not separate entities.

It also might just give people false hope and waste time in potentially pseudoscientific rabbit holes, but then again, this sort of mentality is partly responsible for me still being alive today 🤷🏼"	InanimateSteelRod	reply	na	na	na	0.002916232217103243	weak	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
"Well said. I like how you worded that last paragraph. Something I think we can all agree with. 

I think with enough determination and applied knowledge you can overcome most ailments such as these. The danger I see is how impulsive somebody in this position might become. I know myself that I am far to eager to see results and I often rush trials that I know I shouldn’t, or trial medications that could potentially make things a lot worse. 

You mentioned antidepressants fixing HPA axis dysfunction. Specifically relating to cortisol responses and consequently a reduced adrenergic tone over time? I always thought of HPA dysfunction to be secondary in most cases of anxiety in which hormonal causes have been ruled out, other than mild hypercortisolism. Perhaps that is what occurs with anti-depressant use? Even the increases in Allopregnanolone seen with SSRIs could be causative in that effect. 

Sapropterin Dihydrochloride (Kuvan) is something I was trying to convince my psychiatrist to prescribe. It is very difficult to get. I did convince him to begin the process of requesting permissions for a “high tech” prescription, as it is government funded here. My theory behind it came from my MTHFR mutation as it implicates the BH4 cycle and BH4 synthesis. There is some small degree of efficacy in increasing BH4 through supporting its synthesis via B-vitamins. Provided a low to moderate dose of folate is used, as the folate and BH4 cycle both use the same enzyme. High dose folate in theory may limit any benefit on BH4. This seems to be the opinion of Chris Masterjohns. 

To give further insight, there have been plenty of people to report success with Kuvan. There are also plenty of people to report that it was a waste of time. So as you say it could be somewhat of a rabbit hole. It was for me for a while. I had a theory about BH4 being linked to NMDA receptor hypofunction and schizophrenia. 

In summary you can try:

- Vaso6 (Nitric Oxide specifically, unsure about BH4 however it may increase NOS enzymes so in theory it may work similar to taking exogenous NOSs).

- Support its synthesis with B-Vitamins, Creatine, Glycine, Choline (usual MTHFR support). If you have never tried creatine for this purpose I would advise you do, there is also the theory behind energy production and energy carriers in the brain. Creatine supports this through additional ATP synthesis. 

- Very high doses of vitamin C. I.e. “Megadoses”.

- Consistent vigorous exercise. One of the only worthwhile treatments for me. 

- NOS enzymes.

- High doses of properly cold shipped and stored oral BH4, taken with olive oil or some fat source."	InanimateSteelRod	reply	na	na	na	0.002916232217103243	weak	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

I don’t think its really much to go off of considering the various factors that influence NO production. It is interesting however that nNOS ameliorated some of the effects which would point to NO being involved to a degree.

I’ve seen every doctor you could imagine, had all tests and even seen psychologist (still seeing) who said I’m not depressed and it’s not clear what is going on. Right now I just want to treat symptoms because feeling like this constantly for years has made me non-functional. I have no energy to do anything and everything requires so much energy, even brushing teeth, taking vitamins, my brain doesn’t want to do anything but rest.

I have tried escitalopram but had to stop within two weeks because of severe constipation, it also dilated my pupils. I tried fluoxetine (prozac) for 6 months and it seemed to somewhat improve mood, reduce irritability and give a bit more of a push but it didn’t touch my energy levels. It did however very noticeably dilate my pupils and this wouldn’t go away even after months. Eventually, my mood flattened out and it became even harder to do anything so I had to quit the fluoxetine and I feel like I’m now back to where I was before but for  I feel like I still have some of that flat effect (facial expression feels stiffer, it takes more to smile / show emotion than I can ever remember). 

It should be said that I’m sensitive to caffeine and get heart palpitations, nervous, etc so I don’t consume this, I would like to avoid these effects with antidepressant of choice but at the same time I really need energy.

Well if you’ve had a sleep study done and you aren’t narcoleptic or have sleep apnea, then I would try an snri like Cymbalta, or ndri like Wellbutrin. These work on the chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine to a higher degree than SSRI’s which seems like what you may benefit from according to your symptoms. If you would rather not be on an antidepressant as they can be quite finicky to tolerate sometimes, Modafinil is usually much easier to get prescribed off label for depression/add/fatigue than amphetamines, so maybe ask about it again and why you think it may benefit you. At a certain point though if you don’t feel like your doctor is providing you the best treatment possible, then try to find someone who is more open minded.

I have had a sleep study (Polysomnography) so sleep apnea is ruled out but strictly speaking narcolepsy isn’t, it requires a different test which I can’t have done at the moment because of other issues. I don’t feel like narcolepsy really fits with my experience though because I don’t fall asleep even lying down to nap during the day if I’ve had 8 hours of so of sleep at night. I was also thinking wellbutrin or reboxetine. Modafinil was my first choice but doctor said that the law here (I’m not in the US) doesn’t allow for that, hereit can only be prescribed by a sleep doctor and after diagnosis. Amphetamines can be prescribed by doctor but the treatment must be initiated by a psychiatrist but they refuse to initiate without a diagnosis, so here I also got nowhere.

"Hello

Unfortunately, I have been dealing with Anhedonia for over a year and a half now. I am basically bored with everything - Nothing to look forward to and nothing to enjoy in the present. I just don't seem to enjoy things anymore.

Filling my day with activities feels like a chore. Some days are better than others. Everything feels harder.

**Why did this happen - A few ideas:**

I am 29 - and have been exercising and eating pretty healthy throughout my 20s. So this can't be the problem.

A few years ago I had **half of my thyroid** removed due to a nodule - My TSH is now around 3 vs 1 pre-op, but I am supplementing to get my TSH back to how it once was. This could be a lead, but I've been supplementing for a few months now and can't see a lot of success

**Weed - PORN - MASTURBATION -** I had, for 1-2 years, a really bad habit of watching porn and smoking weed in the evening - and masturbating. For hours on end. 3-4 hours. Every evening. I gave up this habit a year ago.

**Nicotine -** Nicotine affects me differently. It's easy for me to quit smoking. I started smoking just before I started experiencing this anhedonia - I could feel my anhedonia growing 'stronger' the more I smoked. Weird. I gave up smoking around 4 months - still the same issues. Also smoking always made me anxious. First time I've started - fight or flight states when smoked

**I took** Aceylcysteine for a year - around 1.2g per day (this could lower glutamate levels but I doubt this is the case) - gave up on it a year ago

Can't think of anything else

**What meds did I try:**

My first med was **Fluoxetine -** Shortly after I started feeling like this. Took it for around 6 months and didn't notice any benefit.

Then right after I gave up on it, in **November last year,** I got on **Bupropion -** 150mg and sometimes 300mg a day. **Took this until March.** Didn't notice much to be honest.

**I have also been prescribed methylphenidate** which helps a bit but not a lot - I'm not taking it anymore because I don't want to fuck up my dopamine receptors even more.

\--------

I honestly don't know if I should pursue meds anymore or try behavioral activation; change my attitude towards anhedonia, do more CBT/therapy, and so on.

However, I've talked with my psych and I don't know - I keep hearing how **SSRIs and SNRIs** are bad for anhedonia because they themselves can cause emotional numbing.

Bupropion, as I said didn't help me.

My psychiatrist is open-minded and is open to suggestions but in our last session she recommended **Tianeptine.** This seems to be a weak agonist of MU opioid receptors which I can see it working, but I don't want to do even further damage and desensitize my opioid receptors.

"Worth a shot, just dont abuse Tianeptine. LDN is very relatively weak (also wouldnt take it with Tianeptine) but also low risk. 

I lost faith in CBT for emotional blunting. It doesnt do anything to the actual symptoms. I also cannot change my attitude to anhedonia, its impossible as the symptom is so bad. CBT is presented in such a dumb way as “change this thought and you change the feeling” but that doesn’t even work to get rid of the anhedonia.

SSRI/SNRI do have a lot of risks in general. Even for non anhedonics they have themselves made them anhedonic.

You will need to find an endocrinologist with half a brain as most of them have no clue about  treating thyroid.

I'm thinking the anhedonia is more likely from ineffective treatment of depression rather than drug induced. You may also have ADHD traits.

I'd try what your p-doc is suggesting.

Is there any research on surgical implants and mental health and cognitive function?  I had a titanium plate some screws and a nylon mesh in my skull for a fractured orbital. Have just been looking into whether those can adversely affect mental health, like if they leech into your bloodstream or something. Would not surprise me if things like artificial hip or something adversely affected overall health, I question the long term safety of some of the materials that are put into bodies	carlsonbjj	post	39.161548121235306	female	White	0.9927667379379272	na	na	na	9	depressionregimens
"Interesting question, even if it might seem obscure or ""paranoid"" to some. 

I don't have enough information to tell you one way or the other. I know many implants or non-biological additions to people can theoretically be problematic over time, but there are so many variables - the biggest of course being how an individual body responds to it. I had a surgery in 2006 that supposedly is routine and unproblematic for most people, but completely fucked over my health (then again it was because tissue was removed from my nose, not added).

I'm actually (hopefully) getting an wire/battery-powered pulse generator called a ""Vagus Nerve Stimulator Implant"" for TRD (and some other health problems). I won't go into all the details, but in principle, like your implants, the positives to one's self health are supposed to consistently outweigh the negatives (statistically). The wire/generator can potentially cause infection, but the materials of which they consist, I don't believe are found to be harmful inherently. But I don't believe we have the means to measure the levels or effects of the potential ""leeching"" on an individual basis. Think about how women respond to IUD implants for some reference (but the copper is chosen for a reason). 

I'd be far more worried about how much plastic one consumes than anything metallic. The materials surgeons use for modern implants and organ-repair/bone/joint reconstruction are generally far safer than anything used in the past. But I'd find out then specific materials used for your surgery, then do some googling. I've had to do my own research for my specific health condition. But overall I wouldn't worry about it. If you're have mental illness symptoms, I'd imagine they're more related the the trauma you experienced, chronic pain, or perhaps somewhat temporary limitations in your MMA training. 

I know when I was maimed by my nose surgery/got a nerve disorder over a decade ago (and injured my groin and a rib slipped out and no doctor caught it), I was absolutely devastated I couldn't train in MMA: martial arts was/is an integral part of my identity and zeal for life. I'm not saying your situation is AT ALL as severe, so please don't think you're me lol; but I'm saying you may be feeling down in the short-term at least due to your injury. It's not uncommon for fighters to deal with mental health problems when they can't train or are impaired - especially if they're experiencing CTE. But overanalyzing the issue can be psychologically self-limiting and potentially lead to hypochondria; so be kind and patient with yourself. Obviously don't push yourself too hard too soon either.

"Titanium is used because bone will attach to it, and because it is half the weight of steel while having a great deal of tensile strength

There are rare cases of reactions and hypersensitivity to titanium.

Cases of nylon reaction are even rarer.

I'm wondering what kind of head injury you might have received from that injury. TBI can result in depression and anxiety. And it can be incredibly difficult to treat.

**First my background then I'd love your layperson opinions**🙂❤


I've had partial response to effexor. My brain's been wired ever since I was a teen to require some kind of ssri (or in this case snri) to keep ocd/depression/anxiety/and mood swings at bay. I've been on one ssri after another or snri and they luckily produce a partial response, it's just none worked that better than the other

Diagnosis

Anxiety, Depression, OCD, AND at this point MILD spectrum schizoaffective disorder (i'll explain later)

**Rexulti 1 mg**

That being said I feel very grateful that I am trying Rexulti 1 mg. No, my doc is not a pill pusher, in fact I wanted to voluntarily ""guinea pig"" myself and insisted on Rexulti. 

**We may be able to not only reduce what MAY be negative symptoms of my Mild Spectrum Schizoaffective** (at this point its mild spectrum) **BUT** perhaps **IF** **the ssri properties of effexor induced amotivation symptoms/blunted social life** (this is theoretical and my therapist technically said it could be a combo of both residual negative symptoms of schizoaffective, depression, AND my serotonergic antidepresssant blunting motivation as an unintended side effect) 

**THEN the Rexulti might lift me out of those problems because of the pro-dopamine activity I'll get in my frontal lobe receptors, D3 receptors, and alpha 2 adrenergic blockade which means it disinhibits norepinephrine like Remeron**

It also may prevent getting what I refer to as ""half-delusional thoughts/sensations"" that come up if I'm under stress from things in my life that make me feel sad (lack of sucess with women  wanting to date me or even just get intimate ;),  lacking motivation to pursue my hobbies and get in that flow state, wishing my brain was more normal and I didn't miss out on my social life as a teen to young 20 year old) and a few other things I won't get into.

The result is I get sensations that I KNOW INTELLECTUALLY are delusional like feeling watched and I'm thinking to myself ""that pesky amygdala and hyperactive mesolimbic tract on the paranoia paghways. It goes away 1-5 days later btw. Why cant my NMDA receptors regulate this better!"" (I love getting nerdy with pharmacology)

**The Question**

I understand 1 mg of Rexulti is not the target dose for preventing future ""half-delusions or fear resulting from realizing my brain is acting up to produce these paranormal sensations""

 BUT 

Is it possible even 1 mg of Rexulti can help the mood/antidepressant augmentation? I talked a lot about the delusional sensation tendencies but really I'm very focused on wanting the Rexulti to augment my antidepressant first!

I know on Abilify I see people on tiny doses like 0.5 to 1 mg who swear even that helped their depression/antidepressant, so it gives me hope.

Rexulti the most I know is that it latches onto D2 receptors stronger than Abilify and activated D2 at about 45% (autoreceptors and post synaptic) besides D3  (that's gonna be lower activation of 15% but at 1 mg its supposed to increase D3 density) (ps it may be even more potent than buspar as a partial 5ht1a agonist with some saying it may be almost a full 5ht1a agonis


1 mg Rexulti= 62%  plus or minus 8% occupancy d2 receptors (auto and post synaptic)

Maybe theres hope for mood before i have to move uo to 2 mg (and deal with insurance again)?

I would LOVE it if it improved my mood even before i had to work up to standard antipsychotic doss"	EyeballSniffer	post	26.348361361906047	male	White	0.003166096517816186	na	na	na	5	depressionregimens
why can’t to stay on 1mg? and yes, maybe the 1mg dose can stop the psychotic symptoms and improve mood symptoms at the same time(even though there isnt much d2 blocking)	EyeballSniffer	reply	na	na	na	0.003166096517816186	no	no	strong	na	depressionregimens
Rexulti works for me as an antipsychotic at 1mg. I have mild bipolar 1 where my mania is relatively mild (as full-blown mania goes, anyway) but does present with some delusions and occasionally hallucinations. I was pretty sensitive to abilify as well, which worked as an antipsychotic for me at 5mg and even worked moderately well as a mood stabilizer (but was losing its antipsychotic properties) for me at 2.5mg. It really depends--those dosages are just what's typically needed, not a hard and fast rule.	EyeballSniffer	reply	na	na	na	0.003166096517816186	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
"Well it was just the doc pointing out and research I saw online that 2-4 mg is the target range for psychosis (then again im really mild on the delusional/paranoia spectrum....typically anyway). I usually hear about ppl on 2 mg for depression but it makes sense that low doses like 1 mg of rexulti (which is still bigger than 0.25 or 0.5 like I see some people start at) could indeed have a robust mood antidepressant/anxiolytic effect

Thanks for your input

I do think Rexulti has quite an interesting pharmacogy when it comes to being a ""tweaked or slightly altered version of Abilify""."	EyeballSniffer	follow-up	na	na	na	0.003166096517816186	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"Hi. So, my doc is trying something new again and I was prescribed aripiprazole at a low dose, as an attempt to balance the anxiety out. I have started with 1.25 mg and don't notice many side effects, only mild tiredness/waking up during the night and slight restlessness (not akathisia so far).   
From what I've read, bupropion slows the metabolism of certain meds down\*, making their actual concentration somewhat higher. If it is correct, I am wondering if I should increase to 2.5 mg or stay on 1.25? Avoiding any harsh side effects is a priority, but having the med do its work is no less important.  


>\*Bupropion and its metabolites are inhibitors of CYP2D6, with hydroxybupropion responsible for most of the inhibition. Additionally, bupropion and its metabolites may decrease expression of CYP2D6 in the liver. The end effect is a significant slowing of the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme.   
  
>  
> CYP2D6 inhibitors increase aripiprazole concentrations to 2-3 times their normal level.

You can assume that your 1.25 dose is multiplied by at least 2 times since the interaction is documented. Dosing is an individual thing so you might need more/less depending on how you feel. Abilify occupies more than 80% of D2 receptors at a 2mg dose so going upwards mostly increases its effects on other receptors.

"Pre-only antagonism for Aripiprazole is almost impossible unless you go for extremely low doses (like less than 0.1mg probably). A better presynaptic D2 antagonist is Buspirone, it should only antagonize pre synaptic receptors up to 20mg or so .

https://www.nature.com/articles/npp200833

Edit: pre-synaptic antagonism causes dopamine release and stereotypy, post synaptic antagonism causes catalepsy and parkinsonism.

pre-synaptic agonism causes yawning and dopamine inhibition, post-synaptic agonism causes stereotypy

That's for D2. D3 agonism causes impulsiveness and easy reward seeking. Aripiprazole agonises D3 hence the impulse control side effects."	Shroomyboyo	reply	na	na	na	0.0023301446344703436	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens

Long answer: They change your brain chemistry (Gaba and Glutamate) and in many cases, lead to early onset alzheimers, amongst other things.Please get off benzos. Go to benzobuddies forum and have a read: [http://www.benzobuddies.org/forum/index.php](http://www.benzobuddies.org/forum/index.php)

Benzos are about the worst drug out there. I speak from personal experience, and a long battle of withdrawal (after only 8 month's use).

(btw, if you take caffeine in any form, I strongly recommend getting off, slowly. This will reduce 90% of your anxiety and greatly improve your quality of life.

Ansofaxine（Toludesvenlafaxine） is SNDRI. Ansofaxine（Toludesvenlafaxine） (the Chinese name) has a high binding affinity for serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters and significantly inhibited the reuptake of all three monoamines- IC50 = 31.4 ± 0.4 nM for serotonin, IC50 = 586.7 ± 83.6 nM for norepinephrine, and IC50 = 733.2 ± 10.3 nM for dopamine in vitro (serotonin:norepinephrine:dopamine = 23.3:1.2:1) .

"So, I started taking sertraline 5 days ago which I think is fine but I struggle with avolition and I was wondering if other SSRIs were better for that, in particular vortioxetine. My doctor would not prescribe anything dopaminergic since he diagnosed me with bipolar. However I have self medicated with selegiline in the past tho and I still take psychedelics and smoke weed regurarly without problems, I don’t think wellbutrin or a dopamine agonist would be a problem for me, i am thinking of convincing my doctor to change my diagnosis since he’s proving to be very collaborative

Anyway, I asked ChatGPT which one is most activating between the two (setraline and vortioxetine) and it replied:

“Sertraline and vortioxetine can have different effects on individuals, and the experience of activation or sedation can vary from person to person. However, in general, it is more common for sertraline to have activating effects compared to vortioxetine.

&#x200B;

Sertraline (SSRI):

\- Activation: Sertraline is known to have a more stimulating effect on some individuals, especially at the beginning of treatment. This can result in increased energy, improved motivation, and reduced fatigue for some people.

\- Individual response: It's important to note that individual responses to medications can vary. While some individuals may experience activation, others may feel more sedated or experience no significant changes in energy levels.

&#x200B;

Vortioxetine (Serotonin modulator and stimulator):

\- Activation: Vortioxetine is generally considered to have a more neutral or balanced effect on energy levels compared to sertraline. It is less likely to cause significant activation or sedation.

\- Individual response: As with any medication, individual responses can vary, and some people may experience changes in energy levels while taking vortioxetine.

&#x200B;

It's important to discuss your specific concerns about activation or sedation with your psychiatrist. They can take into account your individual characteristics, medical history, and any other medications you may be taking to help determine the most suitable treatment option for you.

&#x200B;

Remember, finding the right medication and dosage often involves a process of trial and error under the guidance of a healthcare professional. They will closely monitor your response and make adjustments as necessary to optimize your treatment outcomes.” END response

"I was taking Duloxetine for over a year and had near constant diarrhea/digestive issues.  I kept my physician in the know and just accepted it at the time because the medication was very helpful for my depression.  I recently switched to Clomipramine and noticed that the diarrhea did not go away.  While I know it's possible that I am having the same issues with this medication, it seems unlikely.  I tried a few dietary changes such as avoiding dairy and am now trying some time without gluten.

Has anyone had longterm digestive issues with either of these medications and found a way to resolve or work around them?

The only other thing I could think of is mild persistent serotonin syndrome but that seems highly unlikely."	Leestonpowers	post	36.038155329323985	male	White	0.9994199275970459	na	na	na	13	depressionregimens

"TW for suicidal ideation. I 100% understand if my post gets deleted. I'm posting this to anywhere I think I can find somebody, ANYbody who could give me some semblance of advice.

I'm a 24yo American male and I'm completely lacking in motivation and purpose.

I've always been a lonely and mentally ill person. Anxiety, depression, suicidal, etc. I feel very little positivity and joy. I lack the motivation for self-improvement and self-reliance.

Ever since my youth, I've never been much good at making friends. Was never a very social or motivated kid. I've seen it said many times that charisma and having connections are essential to success in life. I severly lack social skills/people skills and fear that this has crippled my ability to live a well-off life.

I suffered a mental/emotional breakdown in 7th grade due to the stress of the workload. I got diagnosed with Asperger's and spent proceeded to spend most of my time in the special needs classroom. I've suffered several breakdowns throughout my years as a middle and high school student. Lots of banging on walls, lots of crying, lots of screaming, etc. I was the stereotypical ""psycho"", the quiet loner kid with no friends and no social skills. I dropped out of several high-demand classes and clubs as a result of never being able to handle the workload/responsibility (APUSH, robotics, Beta Club, National Honor Society, etc.). I never took the SATs or anything like that. I feel horrifically ashamed and guilty and useless and worthless because I could never make it in these classes/clubs. It's resulted in me feeling constantly suicidal to this day due to never living up to my own hefty expectations of myself.

In 10th grade, I confessed how sad and angry and suicidal I am to a guidance counselor and it landed me a week in a juvenile mental facility. I wasn't allowed to return to school for half a year after that. I totally screwed myself even further. Shoulda just kept my mouth shut.

I'm still living with my parents and am totally dependent on them for everything. I never learned how to do all the things kids are supposed to learn. How to make friends, how to swim, ride a bike, etc. I'm 24 and I don't know how to drive! And as an adult, I know diddly-squat about insurance, homeowning, taxes, etc., or any other important adult stuff. I've been working part-time as a dishwasher at Cracker Barrel for the past 8 years, less than 20 hours every week. I still rely on my parents and grandparents to get me to and from work. I feel like such a massive burden and have attempted to take my own life multiple times.

Sis got accepted into college recently. She's absolutely amazing, an extremely talented and intelligent young woman. An artist, musician, writer, etc. Recently, I overheard Dad telling her how great she is while talking trash about me behind my back. Said I'll always be dependent on him and Ma. He's sick of it and moving out in September. I'm absolutely terrified of what'll happen to us once he goes.

I confided in Sis about what I heard and she told me she wanted to yell at Dad and tell him to shut up right then and there. That a parent should never talk like that about their child. She offered to help me learn how to drive and she offered to help me apply for college. But I'm so genuinely terrifed that I'll crash and burn in college (see my previous academic history of stress and mental breakdowns). I'm so, so, so genuinely scared outta my mind that I'll never make it. That I'll never amount to anything, so why bother accumulating debt if I'm probably just gonna drop out like I always do?

I've become hyper-fixated on the concept of euthanasia. Death with dignity, the right to die, etc. This suffering is just too much to bear. I'm so sick of myself. I wish I was normal. I wish I wasn't so emotional and outbursty. I wish I wasn't so socially inept and helpless. I wish I leaned how to swim and how to bike and how to drive when I was a kid. I wish I knew how to be responsible and own my own place and do taxes. I'm the type of person who needs firm directions from others in order to achieve some semblance of function. Can anybody give me direct and concise orders on what to do next? I can't do this alone...

I apologize if all this comes off as whining and complaining, I'm just so very sick and tired of myself. Seriously, what should I do? What CAN I do?"	DictatorialTyrant	post	25.16103814712266	female	White	0.9983069896697998	na	na	na	15	depressionregimens

Have you thought about talking to someone, like a professional? 

I'm asking because it's clear you want to change parts of your life, and better understand yourself. Talking to someone neutral (i.e. not caught up in your family disagreements), means they can offer a different perspective, and advocate for you.

You could look into finding a therapist, or just finding someone you can talk to regularly to vent, and get advice from. 

In the short term, try to make a list of the things that make you feel better. Come up with stuff that you can do in under an hour and that don't involve a computer or the internet. So that might be taking a walk, trying a new recipe, meditate, doing some exercise etc.

I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. I was in a similar place at your age (and tbh still am now, kind of). You asked for advice (I take it you don’t want to constantly feel this way) — take your sister up on her offer. It’s the path of least resistance yknow? You identified a bunch of things that you’d like to do and it’d be easy for me to tell you to just do them, but we both know that’s much easier said than done. So having your sister be willing to help you with some of them is so lucky for you. And get therapy, so you can manage your expectations more. When there are hiccups along the road, you won’t fall so hard. (Though you should have therapy in general. Medication? Are you medicated? It’s hard to do anything when you’re constantly fixated on dying. Shit’s not sustainable. Trust me.) I wish you luck, truly.

"Hey, firstly if you are not in the best place to think about studying working, then make the most of any support you’ve got for the conditions you have and remember that if you got out of bed that morning, you have a purpose. If you feed a cat or dog you have a purpose. A purpose doesnt to be linked productivity in anyway. And remember you’re unwell, so don’t worry about making friends, connections, having things to do each day, just be happy and satisfied you’ve done little things. Little wins are good. 

for instance managing to get out out bed at at 9am every morning, reducing social media, quitting sugar, these are all accomplishments. If you, get up have a shower and read a book that day, then it’s accomplishmen.

id you do want to go to college or school, go for it when you are ready, there is no set in stone plans for everything as we all have our own journey, hardships and difficult situations.

"This is from Chat GPT. I've been using it a lot lately for advice. I asked about how to ask for a raise. Anyway he's what it said when I asked for advice related to your situation.

Oftentimes the advice is too detailed or too much. But I have found it to be an additional resource.

Hey, I wanted to share some thoughts on finding purpose when you have Asperger's and dealing with unsupportive family dynamics. It can feel overwhelming, but remember, you're not alone in this journey. Here are some things to consider:  
  
Understand Yourself: Take the time to understand your unique traits and challenges associated with Asperger's. It's important to know how it affects your social interactions, communication style, and sensory experiences. This self-awareness can help you navigate situations with more confidence.  
  
Focus on Social Skills: Developing social skills can be a helpful tool in building connections and overcoming challenges. Consider seeking guidance from therapists or participating in social skills training programs designed for individuals on the autism spectrum.  
  
Seek Supportive Communities: Look for communities, both online and offline, that are specifically geared towards individuals with Asperger's. These communities can provide understanding, support, and opportunities for social interaction with people who share similar experiences.  
  
Advocate for Yourself: It's important to advocate for your needs within your family and other environments. Communicate your preferences, set boundaries, and educate your family members about your unique challenges and strengths. Your voice matters.  
  
Embrace Your Interests: Your intense and specialized interests are a source of strength and potential purpose. Embrace and explore these interests further—they can provide you with a sense of identity, fulfillment, and even potential career paths.  
  
Develop Coping Strategies: Building coping strategies can help you manage sensory sensitivities, anxiety, and other challenges that may arise. Deep breathing exercises, creating sensory-friendly environments, or using visual schedules are just a few examples. Find what works best for you.  
  
Celebrate Your Strengths: Recognize and celebrate the strengths and unique abilities you possess. By acknowledging and utilizing these strengths, you can build confidence, find purpose in areas where you excel, and counterbalance the impact of unsupportive family dynamics.  
  
Remember, this journey is personal, and it's okay to take it at your own pace. Seek professional guidance from therapists or counselors who specialize in working with individuals on the autism spectrum—they can provide personalized support and strategies tailored to your needs.  
  
You have the strength and resilience to find purpose and overcome challenges. Keep pushing forward, and know that you're capable of creating a meaningful and fulfilling life for yourself."	DictatorialTyrant	reply	na	na	na	0.9983069896697998	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"You wrote because of the human need to scream our pain, even if it's into a void.

My life is an exact parallel to yours, although I've had more than my fair share of bizarre tragedy mixed in.

I'm a retired tier2 Operator and ultra endurance athlete. For something like 40+ years, runs and crazy workout have sustained me.

Up until 3 months ago, I followed an identical routine 7 days a week: up at 4am, a 7-10 mile run at dawn, an afternoon workout of a 45 minute ab session followed by sets of pushups, dips, etc...all isometric...that lasts something like 30 minutes.

Every other day, I finish by lifting... light weights to exhaustion.

I had, no surprise here, an overuse injury to both my lower back and right shoulder, so I stopped eveefrything but the run.

Last week, the pain when I ran became so intense I just couldn't do it. I haven't run in 5 days.

I have an appointment with a physiatrist and pain medicine MD this week, but I went that route 10 years ago and it didn't do squat. I transitioned to 2 hours on a stationary bike at the gym, a zillion stretches, and light lifting and ultimately everything healed.

Now, I've come full circle."	HeavyAssist	reply	na	na	na	0.9985747337341309	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

It blocks me in taking productive and constructive action. I am wasting my time with unnecessary detail work.

Everytime I am on SSRIs (Sertraline, Escitalopram etc.)

Anyone of you experienced something similiar?"	Thomas_Bonk	post	25.173838451606304	female	White	0.9994187355041504	na	na	na	2	depressionregimens
"try adding imipramine, is very potent on serotonin, which is usually the goal in treating ocd. It differs from ssris in receptor profile, its more sedating, maybe it will work.

"Ssris do not work as intended all the time, there are a couple of reasons behind it:

1- Simply, it is wrong SSRI. Not all Ssris fit to same person. There is misconception about Ssris that, they are all the same. Absouletely not, they often target different receptors, as well as having different action on other systems. (For example, escitalopram is way more seratonergic, and often inhibits dopaminergic signalling and reduces motivation. Whereas, Prozac may increase motivation/ or negatively cause agitation for already way overactive people, as because it is antagonist at 5-HT2C receptors which increases dopamine in prefrontal cortex. Or Sertraline is DAT inhibitor sigma antagonist, and supposedly have some distinct than effects) Other than these, genetic metabolism and unique structure of your brain plays a role as well on determining a response. I responded in a good way to venlafaxine and agomelatine (though I gave it up, as because agomelatine messes with liver in the long term) whereas vortioxetine and sertraline were disasters for me. (Also had bad response to duloxetine) 

2- Sometimes, lack of essential other nutrients such as Omega-3s, B12, folate, B6 and magnesium/zinc also contribute to efficacy to antidepressant. It is hard to accept, but antidepressants are no magic bullet. (For example, cytochrome enzymes which metabolize drugs are dependant on ceruloplasmin, enzyme form of copper. If someone's body is not processing drugs well in terms of metabolism, then adverse reactions will be more relevant.) 

3- Sometimes you need combinations, not just one drug. For example, people here notice that even @25mg, Lamictal made the necessary change for them. Low dose lithium, adding mirtazapine/agomelatine are among possible options for helping OCD. (You are better to discuss such things with your psychiatrist though."

I get sick pretty often when I take medication, it's kind of normal to react the worst that's possible, but I have an extra problem right now which I developed over the winter... After a gastroscope, I have recently been diagnosed with severe gastritis and mild gastroparesis. This means my stomach produces lots of acid and get's upset quickly, while also slowing down my digestion (including medications). It was so bad they originally thought I have cancer after I ended up hospitalized for a day and had drips and things put on me.... This could very well be an extremely long time to recover. I have been on medications for these stomach issues for nearly 5 months and the whole time I couldn't take mental health meds (besides gabapentin) and it's getting to a very severe mentally ill level... It all started with an unrelated antidepressant, which I quit and couldn't stop throwing up for weeks. Now I only throw up when I take medications. It could be caused by the medications, but more likely it's just extreme sensitivity from my stomach issues. I am expected to stay on my stomach meds for months to years from now, so I've been told....I just don't know, with the exception of the gabapentin that's I've been on for like 14 months, nothing stays in my stomach... and it isn't sufficient to keep me mentally well...

I did this and landed in a psych ward a couple months later. Worst decision I ever made. Do not recommend. Your body is used to having these medications regularly for years regardless of their effectiveness. The withdrawal is sure to be intense. If you want to get off meds, do it under a doctor's supervision. The withdrawal from the benzo alone will be hell much less all the other meds. The fact that you have been on them for years pretty much guarantees a bad experience if you go cold turkey. Hope you can get some help from a doctor.

Please do not stop your meds.  It took me a whole year to taper clonazepam after long term use and it was debilitating.  I could barely work. After trying to taper my other meds (which set me up for another major depressive episode),  I had three additional hospitalizations. I ended up back on clonazepam, as well as the antidepressants . It may be better to focus on reducing one. You can try tapering the clonazepam SLOWLY. Look into the Ashton method.

"Please don’t do this. It’s very bad for your brain, and the rest of your body. 

Have you tried Auvelity? 

What symptoms of depression do you experience? Do you have any toxic people in your life? How about job or financial stressors? Do you have a family history of depression or other mental illness? Have you had trauma in your childhood? Do you have good social support today?

In your case, an MAOI such as the Emsam patch, or Nardil, might make sense. But you couldn’t take them without a washout period from the drugs that you’re on now. (The consequences could be fatal.) MAOI’s have a powerful mood elevating effect. You’d have to avoid tyramine, such as you find in aged cheeses, because it can lead to a hypertensive crisis, where your blood pressure becomes extremely high and causes a stroke. This isn’t really a risk with the Emsam patch. 

If you can wait until next year, ansofaxine will hopefully be approved in the US. Think of it as a much more powerful SSRI, but it’s actually an SNDRI. Clinical trials show a very powerful antidepressant effect, without most of the liabilities of existing SSRI’s. You probably wouldn’t need to worry about fat gain, anhedonia, or sexual side-effects. It’s impossible to know if it would make you sleepy during the day or lethargic, but so far, it looks as though it’s a significant improvement over SSRI’s. 

Don’t forget about non-pharmacological treatments, namely TMS: https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/about/pac-20384625. 

Ketamine infusions are another possibility. 

I hope that these will give you some ideas to think about. Most importantly, don’t stop taking your existing drugs. Within two weeks, it would really start to hurt your brain and daily functioning. Whatever changes you make, do them over a period of months. The brain needs time to adapt. 

If I were you, I’d start with TMS.

Prepare for a rough 2-3 weeks, but it’ll get better once withdrawals are over.  I’d recommend at least tapering somewhat rather than just stopping. Even if you halve each pill for a week then stop it’ll make withdrawals a bit easier. Even better, you could halve the pills for a week and then halve them again the week after before stopping. WDs will still be hard regardless, but would be a bit better.	Environmental_Dog324	reply	na	na	na	0.998993456363678	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens

"Don't cold turkey no matter what you do.  With that regiment the withdrawal will be awful.  You need to slowly taper off of them.  If you cold turkey abilify it increases the chances of getting tardive dyskinesia or akathisia.  Both of these may never go away.  You want to withdraw one medication at a time.  If you can't get kolonopin ask you doctor for a prescription of a similar benzo to taper off of it.  For info on tapering off the benzo check out the site benzo buddies.  I would drop 1mg of abilify every 3 weeks.  For going off the venlafaxine and mirtazapine go to the following sites.  I would save the mirtazapine for last as it may help you sleep as you go through this process.  After being on these for 8 years you need to go off slowly.  Withdrawal can be pure hell.

I have been on Clomipramine 100mg, Abilify 10 mg, Wellbutrin 75 mg and Trazodone 50 mg on and off for about 2-6 months (insurance issues caused getting medicated to be a long process). I’ve been prescribed a few other things but this combination seems to help my OCD the best (also medication of bipolar, ptsd, anxiety etc). I no longer get thought loops and my depression has been minimal however, as of getting medicated, my head is just completely empty. I cannot study or read for my attention span is poor and my brain does not retain anything. This has impacted the things i love, like songwriting, my spiritual practice, and impacted school as well. I also cannot stop shaking which has impacted other things i love like exercise and yoga especially. What should I do? I know changing medications would help but I am so worried about just everything.

"Hazarding a guess  it's the Abilify giving you TD you need to let your doctor know and get weaned off. Those tremors are a side effect that needs addressing ASAP.

In terms of what sounds like anhedonia it's a bit more of a challenge as this can be because of the drugs or a feature of incomplete recovery from depression. 

Feeling suicidal sucks but long term anhedonia sucks as well. 

I am in the fortunate position of being in full recovery (for now) on Effexor 150mg and Wellbutrin 150mg but with a decent dose of both omega 3 fats and magnesium. Plus we got my mHRT sorted.

i’ve been fighting anxiety and depression since i was about 5 or 6 years old. my pediatrician actually suggested putting me on antidepressants as a child to my mother and she declined for very understandable reasons. i continued to struggle until 17. i had a big mental breakdown and ended up on lexapro, risperdal and klonopin. it worked okay but i still ended up in the psychiatric hospital where they discontinued my lexapro and upped my klonopin to .5mg 3 times a day. i just remember feeling like a zombie. a few months after that, i had trialed other ssri’s and snri’s and they all made me feel like absolute shit. eventually my psychiatrist put me on amitriptyline. my mom is on amitriptyline and it works for her like nothing else. it completely saved her life so we decided to try it. i eventually got up to 75mg and stuck with that for about two and a half years. it was alright. but just went up to 100mg after a horrible depressive episode where i couldn’t eat or sleep. it took about two weeks but i feel much more levelheaded and rational. i still have anxiety but i’m able to deal with it like a “normal” person. i feel peaceful and relaxed. i’m eating and i’m sleeping. i could cry i feel so okay. my psychiatrist thinks my mom and i metabolize medication differently and that’s why tricyclics work for us. i’m still on risperdal and klonopin once a day but i feel like now i might be able to discontinue the klonopin! i hope i continue to see more benefits from 100mg since it is the therapeutic dose. sometimes the more unconventional options turn out okay :)	peachddani	post	24.828071334836118	female	White	0.0018239279743283987	na	na	na	7	depressionregimens

Not sure if you tried Wellbutrin, but it helped me get my life back on track as far as motivation and energy goes - and gave me a hint of normality when it comes to libido.

The problem is approx 3 months in I’ve developed tolerance to it, and it all went down significantly. While I didn’t return to an apathetic state, the libido went back to zero.

From what I’ve been reading, the problem is that the dopamine receptors are desensitised or have been reduced in density.

Therefore the regimen should be similar to those who desensitised their receptors by other means such as extreme drugs as meth, aderral, cocaine, etc.

Or maybe most of those people weren't really depressed in the first place (there's no meaningful ie objective way to put away major from minor depression as the only diagnostic criteria is some questionnaires and talky talky diagnosis, there's no widely accepted blood or other instrumental measure, et cetera)

"sorry i can’t figure out how to search the sub to see if this has been discussed. i’ve (31F) tried 30+ medications in the last 10 years, the best ones working for maybe 2 years. i’ve had the greatest result from a combo of wellbutrin and lyrica, but it’s been just over 2 years and i’m miserable *again.* i’ve struggled with suicidal ideation for at least 13 years in a “i don’t necessarily want to die, i just want it all to *stop*” way and it gets louder and louder as my meds stop working. definitely have some ptsd and generalized anxiety; bipolar has been ruled out. recently became pretty curious about the possibility of FASD tbh.
    
      
 i have a great psych (finally!) who loves a challenge and just switched my zoloft (miraculous for my anxiety until i tried to get off it and it broke me and stopped working; also too sweaty) to pristiq and i haven’t noticed an improvement yet but it’s only been about a week. i wanted to do ketamine and she was supportive of it buuuut it’s not covered by insurance. weed gummies are the only thing keeping me alive right now i swear, because if i get high enough my memory resets too fast for me to feel anything at all. it’s great but not very sustainable lol. i feel terrible for my fiancée because she’s stuck to this miserable person who can’t feel anything good. she’s so sweet and patient and good to me but i just wish i wasn’t like this.

"So, I got diagnosed with TRD after exhausting a bunch of meds and “failing” TMS. I briefly had some success with ketamine, but nowhere near enough to justify the price tag. 

This winter I decided to go for ECT. It was in some ways a hard decision, and in other ways not hard at all: I was done, ready to die, and each night was impossibly difficult. I was on medical leave from work and not taking care of myself. 

I did 12 sessions over the span of 5-ish weeks, and came out of it feeling wayyyyy better. Is the depression still there? Sure, a bit. But I’m no longer scoring a solid 24-25/27 on the scale, and I don’t spend every night talking myself out of su*cide. It is strange re-learning how to live without that heavy blanket of depression, because it has been all I’ve known as long as I can remember.

Ketamine is the answer. Your psychiatrist can prescribe oral troches that are made through a compounding pharmacy.

"Esketamine (sprivato) was FDA approved for depression with suicidal ideation and treatment resistant depression 4 years ago. Insurance typically covers it. (This is basically ketamine with an active pharmaceutical patent)

Auvelity is a newly approved drug made of wellbutrin and dextromethorphan (which acts similar to ketamine when combined with wellbutrin). Dextromethorphan is over the counter so it's cheap/easy to add to an existing wellbutrin prescription. Also if your post is accurate insurance will likely cover it.

Psilocybin is also an option for treatment resistant depression but illegal of course.

Also if you're not actively engaged in therapy (both cbt & mindfulness) and also working out every you should strongly consider adding those.

Someone else suggested a [MAOI](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/what-are-mao-inhibitors)and that would be a possible next step. I did well on ESAM which is transdermal patch selegiline. (Sp?)

If you need a need stimulating medication, Parnate is an MAOI. Not all doctors are comfortable prescribing MAOIs because the diet is very strict, with life threatening side effects for dietary lapses. But it’s helped a lot of people. Nardil is another.

But it didn’t last. It wore off quick. I was spending $400/session. I spent last summer trying ketamine, and come September admitted myself to a psych hospital, then, desperate, tried it once more after discharge; no dice.

"Re: anhedonia: absolutely! Idk how much of this was anhedonia versus depression-related cognitive cloudiness, but one of my first “oh shit! This might be working” moments was sitting on my friends’ couch (they were/are amazingly generous and let me stay with them a bunch because they lived nearby the hospital I was going to; otherwise it was a 2 hr commute one-way for me) and thinking “Y’know, I want to go read in the park…” and then I actually fucking did it! It was winter so I found a park and sat in my car, but I was able to actually feel like I wanted to Do A Thing, decided to go Do The Thing, and then actually Did The Thing. I texted basically everyone I knew to tell them I was reading again 😂

And as far as memory: also definitely. I have nowhere near the amount or significant memory less I’ve heard of some others experiencing. Even a couple months out I am sometimes struggling to pull up the right words, or remember names of people I haven’t seen in a while, or someone will mention an interaction from months before ECT and it takes a bit to jog my memory.
I am going back to work tomorrow(!) and I am sure there will be things I’ve forgotten since then- even in doing some work-parallel stuff in my free time, there are different things I’ve noticed I can’t remember. But it has not made a huge impact. I don’t have epilepsy but I did have a bunch of seizures on one occasion years ago, and afterward (d/t seizures and/or resulting head trauma) had some significant memory loss. At that time, when I woke up, I had about 30 seconds of working memory, and although that improved I weeks later was still struggling with other memory issues (names, geography, etc). I disclosed this to my provider during my ECT intake and he told me that any indication of memory loss and I would have to stop, because my previous memory loss after seizures was so significant. Thankfully the memory loss wasn’t noticeable during ECT so I was able to complete treatment.

"Hi all. So I was on Zoloft years ago with success and plan on going back on the drug  soon as the Lexapro I've been taking the last decade pooped out on me completely(20MG). It's been starting to feel ineffective over the previous 18 months to 2 years, and I'm just getting worse, and I need to do something soon. Anyways, my new insurance absolutely will not cover branded medications. I've had a bad experience with generics, particularly Lexapro when I was stuck on the generic for a month. I've been paying out of pocket these last few months for the Lexapro, which is astronomically expensive and putting me into credit card debt. Back when I was on Zoloft, I was on the branded version, and this time around, if I want this to work, it will have to be one of the Generics. I'm aware many different companies are now making Zoloft, and I'm just trying to determine what manufacturer's formula is closest to the branded version of the drug. Have many of you had issues with specific generic versions of the drug and not others? 

Chances are I'm going to do a cross-taper from Lexapro to generic Zoloft, so I want my chances of success to be as high as possible.

If you are in the USA the active ingredients in generics have to be the same as the brand name.  The only difference is binders, fillers, and dyes. (inactive ingredients)  The only way this would effect you if you had some type of sensitivity or allergy to one of the inactive ingredients.  I have been on zoloft for ever.  I started on the brand name.  It was switched to a generic at some point and I never noticed a difference.  In the last couple of years the pharmacy must be switching between different generics as once in a while I get round pills and sometimes oblong pills.  I have not noticed any difference.

"Can not answer that in detail, but some interesting background hereto.  
The problem with depression is, it can hardly be measured, how severe it is. Some accept more, others less. Is it ""just"" a winter-blues or very close to self-harm???  


So studies were made.  
People shoudl adjust the coulours of pictures on a calibrated high-quality PC-screen, so they would fit perfect. several pictures, beach, city, sunrise, sunset, sky, animals, plants, flowers etc.

Here comes the interesting part.

Healthy people made it pretty close to regular settings.  
Depressed people pushed the scale higher, some 150%.

Thesis: The more over-coloured they made it, the worse the depression.

"Just sharing my regimen in case it helps someone! 

I have persistent major depression with strong generalized anxiety. In addition to this, I have mild ADD and very high-functioning autism. 

I take 27 mg methylphenidate (Ritalin/Concerta) once a day, first thing in the morning, with 150 mg pregabalin (Lyrica) at the same time. I take another 150 mg pregabalin in the evening, too. 

I found that if I take methylphenidate alone, it turns me into an anxious mess, albeit a very awake and alert anxious mess. 

But if I take it *with* the pregabalin, my anxiety, including my basal generalized anxiety, is totally resolved, and so is my depression. I'm feeling pretty good :)

Gabapentin made me stupid (unable to retain/recall basic information). It stopped working at the starting dose and so I had to up my dose and the side effects became worse. Apparently it may stop the formation of new synapses in the nervous system? Withdrawal was awful, so my doctor bridged me onto Lyrica since its the same family.

Gained a LOT of weight with Lyrica without changing anything else in my life. So I had to go off of it and still had to suffer through the withdrawal.

So it's great while it works, just make sure if you have to stop that you taper as much as you can and allow time to feel like a total junkie while you wean off. Brain zaps are a thing.

"On paper, this makes zero sense, as Mirtazapine is indicated to TREAT depression.

My personal reasons for using it is to counter the sexual-side effects of SSRI, which it sure does work for.

But I've noticed that EVERY time I've been on it, for the next 2-3 days after last exposure, I become so suicidal that I actively research peaceful ways of ending my life.

When it's been out of my system for at least a week... those suicidal feelings suddenly just disappear.

I've tried this enough times over the last 5 years to know for sure that Mirtazapine is paradoxically making my depression worse.

And I think I finally know the reason why: There was a time when, instead of stimulants, I tried Atomoxetine instead. Whilst it worked, I noticed during that time that I felt severely suicidal also. I later read in a scientific paper that Atomoxetine should be used cautiously as it CAN indeed cause this side effect - and the reason is because it acts as a ""partial agonist of the Kappa-Opioid Receptor"" \[1\]. To put it in layman's terms, the Kappa-Opioid Receptor = the dysphoria chemical (ie. the polar opposite of euphoria).

And guess what: there's another scientific paper which shows that Mirtazapine is also a partial agonist of the Kappa-Opioid Receptor. Exactly the same way as Atomoxetine. \[2\]

"I was on fluoxetine, rexulti, adderall xr, and strattera. I think the strattera added to my usual fatigue which compounded with the fatigue from rexulti but it did help my focus when I had the energy to do so. The focus from it is definitely more subtle than a stimulant, but for me I benefitted from taking both at once.

I’ve since tapered off rexulti due to side effects (weight gain and energy), but recently my doctor had me switch to taking strattera at night instead of in the morning and that somewhat reduced the fatigue I got from it.  So if you do end up trying it and you run into fatigue from it, I think its worth asking your doctor to have you switch to taking it at night. I tapered up from 18mg to 60mg and am now going back down to 40mg because of the energy issue. I have fairly bad fatigue regardless, so take my experience with a grain of salt. 

I’ve also taken it with Vyvanse instead of adderall xr and it basically helped in the same way, I don’t think the effect changes much between different stimulants. I wasn’t taking rexulti anymore at that time, so unfortunately I can’t weigh in about that combo specifically.

"I’ve already been on three meds and I know that’s not a lot considering a lot of people try a lot more till they find the right ones, but it still makes me feel demoralized. First off it’s hard for me to even ask for help in the first place because of the depression itself. I’m a teenager and rely on my parents for healthcare. When they don’t take my problems seriously I kind of just crumple and fold because it’s already hard enough to get the motivation to even ask for mental healthcare.

A couple weeks ago my psychiatrist just told me to get a therapist ($$$) after me telling her my meds aren’t doing much at all.

Currently I’ve tried prozac and lexapro and have been on wellbutrin 300mg since november and it has maybe helped me a little. I wake up everyday completely dissatisfied with life. Life feels like a complete blur; akin to a dream because I have derealization. I’ve also showed symptoms of inattentive ADHD and executive dysfunction throughout my life.

"I totally sympathize

It definitely is demoralizing, since tbh it’s really just a guessing game and they aren’t of THAT much use tbh. A lot of times I honestly felt like it was SLOWER because of them since I had to go through them to get the meds.

I tried several antidepressants, a couple of the ones you mentioned as well, all of them made me feel like a zombie.

Wellbutrin was alright I guess but I felt like a robot.

The advice I’m gonna give you will sound totally useless and just full of it but after literally decades of trying I promise you it helps a ton.

You need to do a full inventory on you health, not mental health but I mean bodily health. Are you allergic to anything? Do you sleep well or do you have undiagnosed sleep apnea? Do you have any ailments any reoccurring rashes or just things that bother you? I ask this because almost everyone thinks they don’t have any issues and it’s only upon very close inspection you realize there’s a ton of issues we just normalized. Solving those issues improves my depression a ton.

Also, try getting on Nardil if you can, please research it yourself, but out of all the antidepressants it had the highest score of actually making any difference. Most antidepressants barely improved people’s moods statistically.

Finally, the single most important thing you can learn is to take a pause. Once again that will sound lame and useless and stupid, but I sincerely mean a REAL pause. As in no worrying, no stressing, no thinking.

Learning to just stop your day for 5 seconds, taking a pause, noticing your body, noticing your thoughts and just giving yourself 1 second of total silence from your own mind is literally the most powerful thing I’ve learnt to treat my depression.

We don’t realize it but our depression tends to come from worrying literally 24/7 and we keep thinking bad thoughts and are unable to simply relax from it.

I hope this ramble was somewhat useful, all this advice comes from someone that really really struggled with depression and tried it *all* these three suggestions I don’t make lightly and I promise you they will work."	viverepropitium	reply	na	na	na	0.9984238147735596	weak	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
"I'm going to add a Gen X perspective that might help you with your parents and the issue of getting a correct diagnosis.
Many Gen X parents worry about diagnostic labels that it will somehow limit their kids futures. What they don't realise is a correct diagnosis allows you to find your tribe and get the right help.
We had that issue with my step kids mother and sadly with the family court judge who dicked around on deciding on letting my step daughter get a diagnostic assessment for ADHD (And it turned out to be autism as well).
I'm hoping that thorough physical health checks have been done including iron, Vitamin D and thyroid function which can all add to the problems you are experiencing. A good PCP can do those.
While the other responder has suggested nadril I would guess your parents will freak about the possible side effects. To give you a wee bit of insight into our experience as a family with ND members - my med combination is Venlafaxine and Wellbutrin, my partner (who has inattentive ADHD) is on Wellbutrin and Mirtazapine as well as methylphenidate.
Ask your parents to see a clinical psychologist to get a couple of interviews to see if you might have ADHD. Explain that it's so you can get help to know exactly what support you need.
If they say ""we don't want you to get labelled"", ask ""are you more worried about me getting a label or being medicated for ADHD?""
I suspect it will be medicated and if that's the case you can clearly say ""getting a diagnosis doesn't mean automatically medicating, but it helps work out what to do next.""
I also pick your parents might dismiss your thoughts and feelings and that's why the P-doc is suggesting therapy. While this can help it can also make things a lot more challenging. Until you have the ability to live an independent life sometimes it's easier to not go into family dynamics.
So my advice
1) Get the physical health checked especially the three I have listed
2) Ask your parents about getting a diagnostic screening for ADHD from a clinical psychologist
3) Ask your P-doc about medications in combination. You still haven't tried an SNRI. My sweet spot was with the SNRI and like you I've had lots of issues with SAD

"Well, maybe more worryingly, some of the the negative impacts of meds are very deniable, owing to their often nebulous nature, as well as that of the diseases being treated. To me that's maybe more problematic than just failure.

But that's just the state of the science. I don't begrudge them their poor success rate, but I do somewhat their disposition toward iatrogenic harms, the worst of which are not uncommonly swept under the rug, and their frequent unearned air of confidence. Also not a fan of the use of absurd and patronizing simplifications in patient 'education,' and the failure to make people aware of some of the worst side effects in their effectual agency as salespeople.

But really, they've just got a hard-to-impossible job. That's just how it is. You could improve all of these things and they'd be more humble, careful, and honest, but it wouldn't really be able to address the issue you bring up; that's just because of where we are, and may always be, in psychiatry's historical position in, and as a, science."

It isn't necessarily the doctor failing.  The meds are failing.  There is no test to determine what medication will work for a particular person.  You could have 2 patients with the exact history and symptoms and are given the same medication.  One person does great and the other person does terrible with all kinds of side effects.  A doctor telling someone to cold-turkey a medication is a whole other story.  I don't know how they can't learn about that kind of thing.  They also have job security when there is a massive shortage of mental health care doctors.  Most doctors have waiting lists of 6 months or more.

"I am at a complete loss as to what is going on with these doctors.

During my appointment, he flat out refused to answer the question as to why I couldn’t try that. I literally brought it up five times. He then pushed very strongly on spravato, and I told him that I wasn’t ready for that just yet. 

I followed up with an email, citing the studies showing how modafinil can help label for depression and the office reply was that he will no longer be interested in working with me, that’s that’s the reply.

I’m just at a complete loss is all I can say like how can you be in this profession and not even try to help people that have mental illnesses.

It happened to me too, I was on an SSRI which was effective for anxiety but none for apathy/anhedonia, so I suggested the doctor prescribe me modafinil. He told me no because there was a warning not to prescribe it to anxious people as it could unleash anxieties or obsessions. So he suggested that he prescribe bupropion plus a small dose of pramipexole instead. I was obsessed to try with modafinil at that time, I said no and was shipped to me from India via online pharmacy. But in hindsight I tell you that maybe the doctor was right, modafinil doesn't solve anything, it's not functional because it causes tolerance after a few days, it can exacerbate fears and paranoia and give overstimulation. It also gives a lot of enthusiasm and energy in the beginning which may delude you that you have found the holy grail, but it comes in waves, by the afternoon I was already drained of all energy.

The reason it's important to understand and communicate the difference is that medicine terms these two things very differently. If you have excessive daytime sleepiness, that is called Hypersomnia and there's very specific reasons for that from a medical perspective. Fatigue can also have many underlying causes (like hypothyroidism, anemia, depression, etc) that are very different than the causes of sleepiness.

"I have, I went from easily falling asleep at any moment, and not finding much joy in anything and wallowing in my pain to — quite positive and optimistic and not sleeping as well because I was much more active and engaged with everything.

It was a very long journey but it was totally worth it. I literally reviewed my entire life and questioned if there was something wrong there, try to understand that I got little to no parenting when I grew up so there were a lot of mistakes made that I was now able to “fix”

For example:

-	I first found out I was allergic to dairy, this was 22 years after I was born and I used to complain all the time how bad  milk made me feel but my parents didn’t care so I didn’t understand
-	I then started wondering what else I was allergic to
-	Simply switching to lactose intolerant milk helped my mood quite a bit
-	I struggled with diet then decided to do it proper and do an elimination diet
-	I learnt I was allergic to dairy, soy and gluten. Took years to build the confidence to quit all 3.
-	My mood is now considerable better after quitting them, like night and day better.
-	Then I wondered about my sleep quality, why was I always waking up tired?
-	After asking to do a sleep study they told me I’ve had sleep apnea most of my life and it’s severe. Which explained a lot…
-	So I got myself a CPAP and ONCE MORE my energy levels shot up to heights I literally couldn’t imagine.
-	Then I started wondering about the rash I always had on my head that my parents also didn’t care about to figure out. After my gf helped research I learnt it was SebDerm and that there literally is no known cure, you constantly are itching and stressed and it feels like shit.
-	After 10+ years of searching and trial and error I was finally able to cure it on my own, everything the doctors prescribe simply didn’t work for some reason. I mention this because i really had to fight for myself on this one and that there IS NO guide online or resource for this one. Point is you will sometime have to really fight for something and I was able to cure a lifelong ailment that there is no known cure fire online as of now.
-	After curing my SebDerm I noticed my anxiety dropped CONSIDERABLY, I literally didn’t think I even HAD anxiety, I thought I only had depression my whole life… Point being that in treating my SebDerm I ironically found out after the fact I was suffering from anxiety the entire time and was a cofactor to the depression. So by treating it and the resulting anxiety I also treated even more of my depression.


TLDR: my parents barely raised me, gave me no advice, so I had a lot of room to grow.

I fixed myself by:

-	learning I was lactose intolerant
-	then doing elimination diet
-	learning I was allergic to dairy soy and gluten, stuff I had my whole life with my family
-	I finally quite all the above three completely (very hard goal)
-	my energy levels shot up a crazy amount
-	then I learnt I’ve have sleep apnea my whole life
-	I got myself a CPAP, and energy levels shot up to levels I never knew of
-	then I finally was able to cure my SebDerm permanently and underlying anxiety I didn’t know I had vanished and my mood improved dramatically once more

When I was still unaware of these things, working out helped a ton, but I was always slipping back into depression and wondering why, it was only after I really fought for myself that I treated so many things that were genuine ailments my parents didn’t bother taking care of. It was by doing so that I completely changed my outlook on life and how I felt on a daily basis. 

I did try a bunch of antidepressants along the way, I did self medicate for a while as well, I did do cardio, I did intermittent fasting, I went to therapy etc, all of it.

In the end, fixing all these hidden things helped the most. Exercise once or twice a week now keeps the last remaining depression at bay. I do take supplements (favorite by far is OmegaTAU and Enteric coated NMN by Nootropics depot for mood).

"First, sleep. If you're getting 6 vs 7 or 8 hours, please get as much sleep as you can. So much research supporting that people who sleep less are less productive, more depressed, less healthy in general, so please sleep that 7-8 hours everyday. I literally track my sleep with a fitbit and it has been very very useful.

For general health, I believe cardio is the most important exercise, BUT for mood, anecdotally, I feel resistance training raises my mood so much the day after and the rest of the day, especially heavy lifts. Its been generally agreed upon by the scientific community that QOL increases too if you take action to prevent becoming obese/overweight. Once again, I also use my phone/fibit to track my steps every day to keep my weight in check.

Diet is incredibly important and overlooked by many people and can lead to horrible macro and micronutrient deficiencies that can change mood regulation and hormone production. Food quality is also important, but most people need to get the general foods they're eating right first. For me, I've found a lower carb, higher protein diet is the best, as higher carbs always made me feel lethargic and low energy but listen to your body and what feels good for you. 

I also don't mean to plug any particular brands, as I'm not sponsored, but I feel like cutting down my caffeine and introducing a stim-free nootropic stack has helped me so much as someone whos ADHD too with my general mood and focus. I'm a software developer who needs to be highly productive everyday and I need something that isn't stims to get me off my butt to even do normal things sometimes, so this is the nootropic i use 5-6/7 days of the week:

Lastly, just get your habits and technology in check. Also becoming widely known that misuse and overusage of social media can make you depressed and cause reward-system imbalances in your brain. I use a particular app called Blocksite to block social media apps like TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, Porn, etc since I am impulsive and used to have no self control simply because it was just habit to do these things without thinking to give myself those small hits of dopamine. Also turned off all the notifications to these apps. Important people will reach out to you where they have to to get ahold of you. The first couple days really sucked not having it and adhering to my regimen, but now its relatively easy and I'm able to be produtive during my worktime, which is all I actually need. Find a schedule that works for you, but for me I block them first thing in the morning until lunch (7AM-11:45AM), I have 1 hour of lunch to use all my fun apps (11:45AM-1PM), then its back to being blocked until my workday is over (1-4PM). After that, I usually have enough self control to determine when I want to be distracted and allow myself that reward.

"I work out and do yoga. They help a lot. 

Working out helps me to feel ok with my body, keeps it in shape, and keeps me feeling strong and fit. It doesnt 'fix' depression, but I am probably less depressed than i would be if I didnt work out. Also, there have been days when I have got pretty bad and managed to get myself to the gym, and I usually walk out feeling a lot less bad than when I walked in. 

Yoga is a game-changer for me, but its part of a larger mindfulness thing I have been exploring for a lot of years. It doesnt 'fix' me, but it significantly helps my quality of life, and it also helps to stop me getting very low lows. These days I dont have too many really awful days, and thats in large part due to regular mindfulness practices.

I can still get pretty unwell, and I think if you are a person with 'severe' depression there probably arent too many things that are simple, quick, fixes. I can say though that after years of doing meds and therapy, this routine has been more effective for me and goes a long way to keeping me on an even keel."		reply	na	na	na	0.011907502077519894	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

OmegaTAU is definitely my favorite, it might be subtle at first, but as I treated more confounding ailments I noticed the benefits of supplements only grew stronger.

The supplements I swear by are:

-	Magnesium Glycinate for sleep
-	Vitamin D & K, Vitamin C
-	OmegaTAU (mood)
-	Mag Theronate (helps with anxiety actually)
-	CoQsol-CF alongside enteric NMN (synergy between two leads to energy)
-	Skullcap for anxiety (I wholeheartedly suggest Liftmodes BaiCalm, it's been near life changing for my anxiety, not being hyperbolic)
-	Tongkat Ali & Cistanche (mood and energy)

I purchase all my supps from Nootropics Depot, I am not affiliated with them lol, just prefer buying all my stuff from one place.

I also feel better when I don't have red meat or coffee, my understanding is this is typically due to sulfites. So cheeses, fermented stuff all should affect you negatively as well as they all contain sulfites.

If I were to suggest one more supp, I would seriously suggest Liftmode's BaiCalm for anxiety. It's a multi-stack supplement so it covers a lot of basis, it helps my anxiety quite considerably."		reply	na	na	na	0.011907502077519894	weak	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"Exciting! Glad you are getting a CPAP, it's a struggle to get used to for the first couple weeks, but the improvement in sleep quality and the subsequent energy boost makes me love my CPAP.

That's correct, all treatments for SebDerm are topical. The reason I (and many others) have been unsuccessful is because the available solutions are only targeting the symptom and not the source.

#### Treatment Process

I approached it as if I was trying to eradicate a colony of termites: you can't leave a single one behind, you can't leave their sustenance behind, you have to study their nature, etc.

The solution required these steps:

-	Toss out ALL my hygiene products —— as 95% on the market contain ingredients that feed SebDerm, this required researching which fats and chemicals fed the SebDerm
-	Only purchase products that didn't feed SebDerm
-	Totally abstain from foods I was allergic to —— as I noticed the flare ups coincided with allergic reactions. My hypothesis is that the allergic reactions were lowering my body's ability to fight the fungus and would allow them to spread more rapidly.
-	Apply 1% Acetic Acid —— researched that this would remove the SebDerm's biofilm, a supposed ""shield"" the SebDerm creates. I hypothesized that this biofilm would protect a small portion of the SebDerm from being fully eradicated.
-	Apply Azelaic Acid —— One of a few topical treatments used to treat SebDerm, I just chose this one for no particular reason.

To recap, I approached it like I was trying to eradicate a colony of termites. I tossed out all my hygiene products, purchased products that wouldn't feed the SebDerm, quit food I was allergic to, applied 1% Acetic Acid to remove SebDerm's bio layer, applied topical treatment to kill the SebDerm. 

#### Research Process

The process to reach this solution required plenty of online research. I researched how others tried to resolve their situation. I also researched into the biochemistry of SebDerm. Many online wikis will describe SebDerm by it's *symptoms*, ""Red flakes, rashes, etc."" none of that was helpful. So I had to ask myself what was *really* going on. Upon further reading some people mentioned it was some sort of fungal colony. So I started reading more about fungal colonies in general. That's when I conceived of approaching the problem like a pest control company and really controlling for all possible factors. 

#### Lack of Holistic Research in Medical Literature

To illustrate the depth of how many factors are involved, my previous and last flare up was caused by using a family member's pillow. The flare up was *terrible*, it was only after a week of trial and error that I realized where the source was coming from. This goes to show how classic medical literature doesn't provide a holistic solution or explanation. Medical literature won't be researching the effects of pillows on the growth rate of SebDerm, the research just isn't there. But, to me it made perfect sense. SebDerm grows on my skin, it grows on my father's scalp, he used his pillow for ages, I visit and use their pillow, the fungus jumps back on my skin, etc.

#### Benefits of Curing my SebDerm

I was surprised that curing my SebDerm resulted in any reduction of anxiety. I set out on curing it because I was tired of the itching and the pains. My theory is that the constant replenishing of new skin cells was in some capacity using resources that could have been elsewhere in my body. A bad flare up results in a rash that might be several square inches in area — many cells are required to attend to this situation. In a weeks time I have a whole new layer of skin cells, the amount of energy required for that is massive and I think often overlooked. 

Secondly, I believe the constant itching was not allowing my mind to fully ever relax. I noticed that when I had a flare up that my anxiety would spike. I believe this was happening because I would subconsciously interpret said itching as anxiety — so it was a negative feedback loop that would feed into each other. More itching lead to more anxiety, more anxiety would lead to more stress and another flare up. Thus by breaking the cycle permanently, I was able to remove an entire factor of stress from my life.

#### General Lessons

I think this just goes to show how the human body is really an entire ecosystem. It's a colony of many parts and many factors are in play. It was only by approaching the problem from a very different perspective that I was able to research and plan a solution that would target *all* possible factors. In doing so I was able to treat the issue I was aiming to treat, but also happened upon some benefits that I didn't expect. But, in retrospect, it made sense as to how this lifelong ailment was greatly reducing the quality of my life.

I really hope this was helpful! I am not familiar with folliculitis, but I hope that by my explaining my reasoning to my solution that it can give you inspiration to how to approach your problem. I went from not really focusing on my SebDerm and just ""living with it"" to occasionally researching it, to making it my second full time job for a good month to plan a solution. I had to use the scientific method and really document my different trials, and I made sure to control for as many confounding factors as possible (hence tossing everything, purchasing new pillow and covers, shaving my head completely, etc.)

"Yes, I got it! The doc called the script into the sleep center where I studied, and they should have my equipment in a week. I requested the Res Med AirSense 11 APAP model, which has favorable reviews. The next battle is going to see how much it ends up costing me with my copay. My aquaintance with the same insurance ended up having a $750.00 copay, which is ridiculous since the machine goes for $1000.00 new. Not sure if that includes the mask, though. I also asked for a copy of my results, and it turns out my AHI in Rem sleep was 101.1, which is off the charts terrible. By the way, what kind of mask do you have? From what I've been reading, finding a mask that works for you is one of the trickiest parts of getting improvement from CPAP. I've made a conscious effort these late few months to breathe through my nose exclusively, but considering my violent snoring hasn't gone away, I opted for a full face mask since chances are I end up reverting back to mouth breathing at night.  
There's a lot of research on how cold showers can reduce stress/inflammation in the body, so stress reduction could be a reason. Also, a more straightforward answer is that cold water on the scalp is less irritating for folliculitis than warm/hot water. Either way, I enjoy the cold shower and plan to stick with it in my daily routine.

"Nice!! And that’s a crazy highs score lol I forgot what mine what. We might have the same machine.

And yea these things are surprisingly expensive…

The one I use also has a water tank, it’s kind of a hassle to use Distilled water as it suggests, but after using tap water for a while, lime scale and gunk does build up. So I suggest purchasing a large jug of cheap distilled water from your market and leave that nearby.

Regarding the masks, I most prefer the airpillow (name below). It’s definitely not the most secure one, but I found some of the others difficult to sleep with. It really does come down to personally preference. I ended up trying all the masks and straps over the course of a few months.

Also, I found that the elastic straps tend to loosen over time so keep that in mind.

I used to also be a mouth sleeper! I was surprised that over time I did in fact change over to nose breathing *while* using the pillow and not the full mask. So it is possible to train yourself but it will take some time.

My only complaint is that traveling with one does become difficult, so I’ve been looking into purchasing the portable CPAP or at least trying to work something out with my insurance. It’s the size of a Walkman and has these hydration tablets.

"I'm doing great with nasal breathing during the day, but one of my significant issues is constant sinus congestion. Having seasonal spring allergies isn't helping much, either. Because of that, I'm worried that I will go back to breathing through my mouth at night simply because breathing would be more natural due to the congestion. I do Neil Med sinus irrigations every other day with xylitol, which helps some but the congestion is always mostly there. Perhaps finding a good ear/nose/throat doctor would help determine the root cause of my constant congestion. I may have a deviated septum and not know it.  
By the way, is your model the APAP or CPAP version? Mine has both options, and I'll be starting with the APAP configuration since I couldn't do the second study and determine my ideal pressure. Did you have many issues dialing in your best settings, or did that just come naturally over time?  
Yea, I hear they are a pain in the ass to clean, but I'm sure you get used to it after a while. I'm already buying distilled water for the Neil Med, so having a few jugs on-hand is standard. Yea, I watched some CPAP YouTubers talk about portable machines. It must make a profound difference if you're looking into portable options! I hope to experience similar results.

"My bad!! Missed your message on mobile.

I also have seasonal allergies but you’d be surprised! The machine is pretty capable and it pushes past most congestion. 

I have the ResMed AirSense10 Autoset. I honestly wasn’t aware there was a term for APAP. It definitely takes time to dial it in, I made sure to change it often and play around with each and everyone of them like a new gaming console — learning each one use etc. I found that the ‘auto ramp’ setting to be the most useful. But, I also found that if you stay up too long after starting the device, that the pressure will be so high it’ll be too uncomfortable to fall asleep. In that case I just restart it. So I make sure to ‘start the ramp’ pretty close to when I plan to actually sleep. I also enjoy reading with it sometimes lol, it seems to help on bad allergy days.

On the note of congestion, I recently started using bronchodilators and I’ve noticed a stark improvement, I’m able to breathe a lot more comfortably and most of my seasonal allergies feel at bay. I spoke to my primary care physician and they said although it’s not correlated they do often see people with sleep apnea also have light or moderate asthma. So that’s something to also consider at some point.

I also planned to find a doctor at some point, but between the APAP and now the bronchodilators, most of my issues have subsided, you seriously should look into that at some point!"		reply	na	na	na	0.011907502077519894	weak	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
"I’ve dealt with depression for about a decade now, I’m turning 23 soon and am AFAB. I know depression can cause both over and under eating, and I’ve always leaned towards the “over” side of that spectrum. But in the last month or so, foods I love (of which there are very few) just don’t interest me anymore. I’ve basically lost my appetite entirely, and I’m very hungry right now but all food just seems unappealing. 
Is this a sign that my medication should be changed? I’m currently taking 250mg of effexor, and that’s been working well for me for the last three years (SSRIs didn’t help, this is the only SNRI I’ve ever been on). 
Also, if anyone has any tips on getting yourself to eat when food doesn’t interest you, that would be greatly appreciated. I do struggle with a sensory processing disorder, and because of that I’m extremely picky about food—I basically live on plain pasta and cereal, and lately I don’t want those but trying new foods can be very stressful for me so I don’t know if it’s worth it to branch out if I’ll just end up disliking the new food as well.

">So I know SSRI definitely doesn’t bring back good feelings (will rather do the opposite) but what about generally reducing negative feelings?

Varies from person to person, actually! The notion that they only numb feelings is a popular myth, but they can restore good feelings in a good number of people (that's the ideal scenario, in fact). If you notice that you're just feeling numbed out, it may be wise to talk to your doc about switching meds.

You say you haven't noticed any change, though, right? It may just be a matter of dosage. If a starter dosage of an antidepressant doesn't work but the patient isn't experiencing any side effects, it's standard practice to increase the dosage. It's bad practice to say a med has ""failed"" without reaching an optimized dosage for the patient. If you're already at a high dose (or unwilling to increase it further) and still feeling no benefit, then yes, time to switch meds."

"Currently on mirtazapine 30mg. I am definitely more tired, and sleep better at night. But everything is just easier, not huge amounts, but enough that I look back and think wow, I'm doing better now. I'm able to get more done because of it.

Also if you think meds are going to do something to you cause someone else had that experience, you can placebo yourself into thinking they are going to do the same to you. 4 weeks is not enough time to decide. You've only gotten started. Furthermore, an antidepressant isn't going to fix you, it's meant to make things easier allowing you to make structural change though things like talking therapy. It's not an easy path, and it's not a straight line. This is my third antidepressant and I'm nearing 100 sessions with my psychologist. And yes, sometimes I feel like there is no improvement, that I'm stuck and not going to get better. But I try to hold onto hope that tomorrow will be better than today.

Regarding calling it quits, give it time. 4 weeks is just starting with antidepressants, unless you're having bad side effects that make your life significantly worse, stick with it.

There’s bipolar 1 and 2. Bipolar 1 is what we associate with “super crazy” behavior.  Bipolar 2 is more mild and can be harder to catch because the hypomania can be so slight.  As far as serotonin syndrome, some people are more sensitive to serotonin than others. Keep an eye on the symptoms and if you have a severe headache, chest pains, dizziness, excessive sweating, confusion, or lack of coordination/jumbled speech seek immediate medical attention.	academicgirl	reply	na	na	na	0.0020891150925308466	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens

You can definitely speak to your doctor about your concerns. What you’re describing leans towards the BiPolar criteria. There’s a good (older) video on YouTube called “Up/Down” on BiPolar Disorder if you want to learn some basics.

Please don’t go off your meds without doctor supervision. BiPolar and BPD are the two most commonly confused for one another disorders.

Usually not. That’s why you need to speak with your doctor. When someone becomes manic from a med change it’s usually within the first few weeks.

I have been on Lexapro for over ten years, doing therapeutic Ketamine, but nothing is helping anymore. Lexapro pooped out on me last year @ 20 mg, and I planned on cross-taping to another medication. I was hoping something like TMS could help me through the rough patch of cross-taping an SSRI I have been on for a long time. Anyways, are there any effects negative or positive I should be aware of when going through treatment? According to research, it's usually 5 days a week for about 20 minutes, but you can drive after treatment. This is important to me since I cannot get rides and would still need to go to work afterward. Hopefully, the treatment provider is flexible with scheduling as I cant miss extended time from work. Also, how did it work with COPAYS? Did you require a copay every visit, once a week, or once for the entire treatment?

OP, if you ARE worried about taking the time and needing more time/etc, I’d encourage you to see if you have a local workers rights center or ADA (Americans with Disabilities Office; might also be called an “Independence Center” and have someone who knows about employment and accommodations).

"I used this AI research tool if you click the link it will take you to the search results page. Most of the studies say heavy cannabis use leads to increased risks of depression. You can also search about disassociation. 

Really I think it comes down to heavy / daily use vs. occasional / social use. 

Also the returns on a t-break max out at about 3 weeks (there’s science to back this up as well) so I’d think if you’re in a depressive ‘episode’ 3-week or so break should help you reset. If you’re dealing with chronic depression maybe longer is needed.

"I think it will become the new normal like with antidepressants, in a way that you might not be extremely depressed as much as before, but a consistent depression along with apathy as it is regulating your depression and keeping you in one place, so to speak. 

It can definitely bring you down in terms of depression, anhedonia can come from most mood-enhancing drugs and cannabis is somewhat notorious for making people down and lazy. 

There's a lot more research on how cannabis can worsen depression, rather than how it can lessen depressive symptoms. I think looking at it from a neutral perspective is the most healthy way to go about it, as there are pros an cons to any drug. 

If cannabis makes you worse in the long run, propably not unwise to drop it. But if it makes life tolerable enough and makes suicidal thoughts go away, it might be better to be cautious and reduce your intake and look for other options and coping strategies while you're at it."

I was given medical cannabis for depression. I found it made me a bit chirpier and jolly but only when I was stoned. So basically I’d have to be smoking none stop everyday for it to help.

"Psychiatry is subjective AF.   


Occasional cannabis use definitely improved my mood at times yet it wasn't a way to achieve remission, rather one of little joys that I had (given the fact that there are already a scarce joys in depression). It's not an approved medicine however.  


On the other hand there were things like zoloft which are approved yet never seemed to improve my mood. In the very best case they could serve like an illusion of getting things better, but they never actually made it better. But zoloft is an approved medication for depression lol. It gave me nothing but some numbing and extreme apathy.  


Yet I rate cannabis leagues above zoloft. Yes, I know I shouldn't compare them. Also zoloft gave me more side effects than cannabis.

"Thank you for sharing your experience with it. I've been on the fence with cannabis for a few months now, debating whether it's supporting my life or taking away from it. I kept telling myself I just need to cut it out completely if I ever want to be ""100% better"".

But I've done a few breaks, both short and long, and did a lot of journaling about my experiences with them. What I found was when I was smoking I really could connect better with the present moment and enjoy what I'm doing. My issue is abusing it. So I made some changes and now only smoke on the weekends either after all my tasks are done or before starting a major physical activity (yard work, biking, etc.).

Now when I use I'm more connected to my surroundings and enjoy life a lot more. Sure I have days when I abuse it and smoke more often than I should, but my past experiences help me recognize the abuse and deal with it. This is a crazy world with even crazier people. We all need something to help us disconnect from the madness of society and reconnect with ourselves. Weed does that for me today."

Chronic and acute THC has differential effects on BDNF release,  with chronic Cannabis reducing BDNF levels and acute increasing it,  while a steady increase in dosage keeps the BDNF levels same as baseline. It is absolutely true that the antidepressant efficacy will be far less while using Cannabis. I've found intermittent use beneficial however, once every few months, but I've been spacing it more and more and it seems that the longer the break, the better it works and longer it lasts.

"It can be a coping mechanism.  Some coping outlets are safe and good, some are not so great for us, some coping can negatively affect us.  So if you are using it to just *cope* with the depression sure it can be seen that way.  What I think needs to change is it being identified as the only possible outcome; people can use cannabis and it is the right coping option.  It affects everyone differently and using a blanket statement imo doesn't help.  It should be an individualized dialogue with providers.

Best part of my recovery this past year was when I was in IOP and the group facilitator just wanted us to be honest about how we coped to explore and identify thoughts and emotions around that.  It helped a great deal and gave me insight into how and why I would use it outside of pain management or recreation, which enabled me to tease out patterns and how my use effects me during all moments, especially during depressive episodes, however they looked.  I have bipolar depression fwiw so it's no go on antidepressants for me and I absolutely have been helped through episodes with cannabis."

Same here, my depression mostly comes from long term anxiety so stopping the anxiety in it’s tracks really helps. I also find it a lot easier to be optimistic about the world when I’m high and it can really shift my headspace into something more productive when used properly. My main suggestion if your struggling with moderating your use is always write done your intentions before using for example: coming home after a long week at work to prepare for your days off your intention may be something like “I am going to ground myself in the present moment and create space for happiness this evening”	Mmarzipan-	reply	na	na	na	0.006283565424382687	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

"Sorry if this isn't allowed here as it's not exactly a regimen, but I thought it was worth making a post to remind myself (and others) that depression can lift. 

Last night when I got home from work I was depressed as hell, with zero motivation to do anything. Collapsed on the couch, zoned out to Netflix and didn't answer my phone. You know, the whole ""dead inside"", anhedonic feeling. (I know it all too well!) Of course when I'm in that state, I feel it will last forever, even if logically I know it's possible it will pass.

But this morning, I got up early, made myself some coffee and a healthy smoothie, and actually felt motivated to pick up my ukelele and sing. I'm NOT depressed, I want to be productive, and realizing this I also realize last night I was in a completely different headspace. Anyway, I'm going to take advantage while it lasts.

I'm on a Zoloft/Welbutrin mix, and I think it's doing something? Usually not to my satisfaction, but hey, this morning I just feel grateful.

I can relate. I’ve had similar thoughts and feelings since I lost a friend 2 years ago. The thoughts of losing my loved ones dominated my headspace. But I had a turning point a couple weeks ago. Every so often my wife and I will let our dog come on our bed and we play with him. 2 weeks ago we did this and I got sad because I remembered that we will eventually lose him and that I’ll be sad and devastated when that happens. But I had another realization which was that yes I will feel sad and devastated, but that now isn’t the time for that. There will be a time for those feelings and that time is when I actually lose him, not when I have him right now. All I’m doing is robbing myself of the present. I realized that I’ve been doing that with my parents who are in their 70’s as well. I’m bracing myself for their passing and feeling sad about it, even though they are in relatively good health now. So I have been actively choosing not to engage with those thoughts and when they come up I remind myself that there will be a time to grieve and feel sad, but it isn’t now. It has really helped me be present with my loved ones. It’s only been a couple weeks but I really think that realization was a big turning point for me.

"Hello, dear Depression Regimen experts:

I am writing with a question(s) regarding the long-term use of psychostimulants.  After a couple sever concussive brain injuries a decade ago, and living a very healthy lifestyle (by way of diet, exercise, sleep, meditation, relaxation, temperature modulation, time spent in natural world, nurturing relationships, etc., etc.,), for 10 years since, I continue to struggle with debilitating fatigue, a depressed mood, and chronic pain (among other challenging symptoms but these are the most notable).  I have also tried every potential healing modality I am aware of (including both conventional and alternative therapies) except two rTMS and Ayuhuasca, both of which I am on waiting lists for.  I have been using bupropion and modafinil for the past three years to manage my fatigue and mood; however, it seems as though modafinil is not working for me anymore (in recent months), given it is not helping with my fatigue and is giving rise to significant symptoms of anxiety that did not use to be present. 
 
My doctor recently suggested trying some kind of stimulant (i.e., methylphenidate or amphetamine-based compounds) which leads me to my questions, which I try fielding to my doctor but I don’t believe she knows the answer to them (I am not sure if anyone does, which is why I’m trying here).

1)	Is anyone aware of reliable information pertaining to the long-term effects of psychostimulants on the brain and/or other aspects of the central nervous system (preferably in adult humans but am open to stuff for any age or species if relevant)?  I have concerns about the long-term effects of reward circuity (e.g., dopamine system); however, I do not know if these are warranted.

2)	Has there been legitimate study about the neuro-toxic and/or -protective effects of these agents?  And if so, do some medication classes appear to be more or less neuro-toxic and/or -protective than others (e.g., modafinil vs. methylphenidate vs. amphetamine salts (like Adderall) vs. amphetamine prodrugs (like Vyvanse)?

Of course, not wanting to waste anyone’s time, I have searched these topics to a decent extent myself and cannot seem to find anything over conclusively (maybe it doesn’t exist or maybe it’s out there beyond my reach) so I welcome anyone’s direction to reliable sources on the topic or original thoughts based on direct/personal experience.

Thank you, very much, in advance."	aybeekay	post	36.885380980874224	male	White	0.9884087443351746	na	na	na	11	depressionregimens
"What's your main problem?
Methylphenidate is in theory safer given it doesn't itself increase the release of dopamine. 
If you try to stick to slow doses you could really try, I'm pretty sure a stimulant could help you with fatigue, for me even a small dose works, and even pain. For the depressed mood is just not sustainable for most of the people, anyways maybe you are one of the lucky ones that have a better tolerance profile. About the pain, it could potentially help.

The reason I say this is because the mood lifting effects of stimulants are short lived and narcolepsy meds like Sunosi can be just as helpful for fatigue without  stimulant side effects. I suppose you could also add a low dose of a stimulant to Wellbutrin. 

As for neurotoxicity, there is some evidence in animals that amphetamine may be neurotoxic at higher doses. It is unclear whether or not this is a significant worry at prescribed doses.

"My best friend weans off to watch motor sport and rugby without meds. He prefers the unmedicated brain for these occasions. What is noticeable is he has more stimming behaviour (hand rubbing and foot jiggling) unmedicated.
He said the most noticeable but for him in terms of difference is he has a slightly longer lag time on impulsive decision making than when he started meds, in his unmedicated state. His description is he has 20 seconds to tell his impulsive side ""that's not a good decision"" whereas before he has 2 seconds.

My partner has inattentive subtype and is more quiet and prone to lose time if unmedicated. He also had such traumatic experience around being abused in a relationship because she could gaslight him so easily, so he has been very reluctant to try medication breaks.
Occasionally he forgets to medicate and it's usually 4 hours later when he has struggled to do something he finds easy on meds he goes ""shit, no meds"".
What is noticeable is he has a pesimistic mind setting but he is now on the right combination (Mirtazapine and Wellbutrin) along with his stimulants and he is no longer dysthymic.

"**Treatment resistant depression**


I've had chronic back pain for the last 10+ years, and lived with it because no doctor could help me. I got anhedonia, depression and social anxiety around the same time. What I've tried so far:

* Classical depression treatment options didn't help (working with a therapist, cognitive behavioural therapy, EMDR, diets, meditation, self-help, yoga, sports, I have a good job, I have friends, overall lifestyle changes, having routines, setting goals, etc.). 

* Antidepressants: Escitalopram (Lexapro), Agomelatine (valdoxan), Venlafaxine (effexor) didn't help.

* I got diagnosed with ADHD. Stimulants (Vyvanse/Lisdexamfetamine and Ritalin/Methylphenidate) help somewhat. 

* What helped the most so far: weed, psilocybin, LSD, ketamine, MDMA, tramadol. These have the best effect. When I trip, I feel good and not depressed for that day, but depression quickly comes back the next day.

**Autoimmune disease diagnosis**

This April I had a flare up, and couldn't walk for multiple weeks. It turns out that I have ankylosing spondylitis, a genetic autoimmune disease which causes inflammation in joints and spine. 

I'm now thinking: maybe I'm depressed because I've been living with chronic pain for the last decade? Maybe the drugs all act as pain killers and distract my mind from the pain? But depression quickly comes back the next day because I'm in pain again?

I'm now being treated for ankylosing spondylitis with Humira and Methotrexate. However, it will take up to 3 months for these medications to take full effect.

**Questions**

* Do you have similar experience with chronic pain and depression?

* How can I improve my depression/anhedonia in the 3 months until the chronic pain is treated at the core?"	LourdesFarley	post	33.657644416514174	male	White	0.012114324606955051	na	na	na	7	depressionregimens
"First of all I'm sad it's taken so long to identify your AS. While it will take a bit of time to get full effect you will notice a difference pretty quickly based on the experience of working with a number of people with AS.
My advice for your depression and anhedonia. Do nothing other than good self care while you get on the meds for AS and get used to knowing about your new diagnosis.

It may have anti-inflammatory properties, but it's also one of the more effective pain killers.

"I did IV ketamine with a guidance of a doctor. I had a total of 8 sessions so far. The positive effects only last for the 1 hour of the infusion, and maybe 1-2 hours afterglow. I quickly come back to baseline depression after that. I guess the pain comes back rather quickly.

In the country I'm in esketamine (spray) can only be administered with a doctor, and cannot be done at home. So legally I can only do IV ketamine with a doctor (not covered by insurance, quite expensive). I'm aware of ""DIY ketamine therapy"" and I've tried insufflated and rectal administration by myself. Here also, the effects last for an hour and depression quickly comes back.

"I was prescribed 150 zofolt for two months then 200 for a month but it didn't do anything for me. now my doctor want me to replace it with effexor by tapering zoloft by 50mg a week and start with 75mg then increase it to 150 in the second week and 225 on the third week to not cause a relapse from tapering zoloft

after reading up on this subs and other in the last few days I am starting to think that reaching 225 in three weeks is too fast even if it's to replace another med. but at the same time I tried too many drugs in the last 12 years and nothing worked to fix my severe depression so I think the doctor want me on high dose since other meds didn't work

I am thinking of taking 75 for 2 weeks then 150 for 4 weeks then go to my next appointment first instead of upping it to 225 in three weeks only? 

side note : I also started wellbutrin 150 xl in the last month and two days ago my doctor increase it to 300 since I didn't notice any benefits on 150

I need an advice before starting on effexor, is it worth a try if most others meds failed? 

is it a good combo with wellbutrin? 

should I go for 150 or 225 dose? I feel like 225 is too much for a start especially with strong side effects if it didn't work it will take ages to go off it

"Hi all, 

A couple of years ago I (31F) stopped taking Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) and spiralled into a dark place. I was on Pristiq for 3 years and it was great for me. I was unsuccessful at going back on Pristiq though. I am not sure why this was the case, but I'm thinking a combination of drinking too much and increasing the dose too quickly. Because I was having trouble sleeping I was then transitioned to Mirtazapine. Mirt was helpful for sleep and appetite but not much else. I then added Lexapro (30mg). I've been on Lexapro and Mirt for about 1.5 years now but I'm still really struggling mentally. I've been through multiple rounds of psychology with not much success. So I'm planning in a few weeks to make the transition back to an SNRI. This has to work as my partner is losing patience with me and I fear that they will leave me if the transition isn't successful. So my question is, should I try Pristiq again or opt for something stronger? I have read that Clomipramine is the strongest SNRI available. I'm not sure if I should request to go back on Pristiq or try Clomipramine. Does anyone have any advice that could help me decide? My main issues are emotional regulation, excessive rumination, suicidal ideation, physical anxiety (chest pain mostly), insomnia and executive dysfunction. I'm unsure if these symptoms are due to undiagnosed ADHD as I do fit the criteria. But I was quite functional on Pristiq and I can't afford an ADHD assessment rn. I'll also add that I've tried medical cannabis. CBD oil only helped a little and it's too expensive. THC helps me sleep but it increases my physical anxiety symptoms.

"""strongest"" doesn't mean anything. Maybe you're thinking of ""potency"". The more potent a drug, the fewer mg you're going to need to accomplish the same thing. If escitalopram blocks 100% of SERTs at 20 mg, and sertraline only does so at 200 mg, then escitalopram is 10 times as potent as sertraline. That doesn't mean that sertraline is less effective, only that more mg are given.

Something to look out for when it comes to SNRIs is the serotonin to noradrenaline ratio. The closer to 1 this ratio is, the more balanced the levels of serotonin and noradrenaline will be. Venlafaxine is not at all balanced, while clomipramine and levomilnacipran are quite balanced.

"Clomipramine (/ its main active metabolite) is so potent an SNRI that it can almost saturate your serotonin and noradrenaline transporters before anticholinergic and other effects become an issue. Affinity for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors is about 100-fold lower.

It is routinely dosed way too high in my opinion, giving it an unfair reputation for side effects. It occupies 80% of SERT around 10 mg/day, i.e. similar to escitalopram, suggesting similar dosages are appropriate (10-20 mg/day; no additional benefit demonstrated for doses higher than 10 mg escitalopram IIRC). Yet clomipramine is routinely dosed at 50-250 mg/day, which seems insane. The thing is that when those standard dosages were set, they didn't know much about the pharmacology and pretty much assumed it was similar to other TCAs and needed similar dosages, while in fact it is the most potent SNRI on the market.

"> Do you mean noradrenaline or norepinephrine? 

'Norepinephrine' is America's name for the same thing :)

In other countries we tend to use the original name, 'noradrenaline' (matching the adjective 'noradrenergic' which is also used in the US).

> A while ago I was researching SNRI potency and read that desvenlafaxine is the next most potent after Clomipramine? 

Desvenlafaxine's affinity for SERT and NAT is about 100-fold and 1000-fold lower than clomipramine and its metabolite desmethylclomipramine's, respectively. If you were to rank them, there are definitely ones that fall in between (duloxetine comes to mind). But this doesn't tell you a great deal — mostly it impacts the required dosages.

> What exactly would be the difference between desvenlafaxine and clomipramine?

So desvenlafaxine requires significantly higher doses to have a similar effect on either serotonin or noradrenaline. But it's more important to consider the balance between effect on serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake. Clomipramine is quite balanced here (thanks to its main active metabolite). Desvenlafaxine impacts serotonin much more strongly than noradrenaline (by a factor of about 10). It's largely an SSRI with a tiny bit of NRI effect. Not very different from if you were to take, say, escitalopram (Lexapro) and add a tiny bit of nortriptyline or reboxetine. (As desvenlafaxine dosage rises, it will almost saturate serotonin transporters, potentially causing severe serotonin-related side effects, before coming anywhere near the same effect on noradrenaline transporters.)

In practical terms, one may work for you while the other doesn't. Our brains are all unique and different biochemical corrections will help normalise different ones. But desvenlafaxine is definitely a lot closer to things you've already tried than clomipramine is.

In the end, categories (""classes"") like ""SNRI"" can be very imprecise descriptors that don't tell you an awful lot.

Case in point: in various parts of the brain such as the prefrontal cortex, the ""noradrenaline transporter"" can actually be the main mechanism of dopamine reuptake. So ""NRIs"" also function as DRIs in ways that ""DRIs"" themselves don't. So desvenlafaxine will also slightly raise the concentration of dopamine in certain groups of synapses, while clomipramine will raise it a lot.

> And what are your thoughts about what another commenter said about ADs not working a second time if they are from the same class? There's a lot at stake for me atm so I need to be very careful about how I proceed.

I don't know how common that is, but it's definitely something some people find but not all.

Ultimately, I would say if you want to try an effective SNRI that's distinctly different from an SSRI like escitalopram (Lexapro) which you've already tried, I would suggest trying 5-25 mg of clomipramine."	coffee_and_cats18	reply	na	na	na	0.9915605187416077	no	no	strong	na	depressionregimens

Thank you so much honestly. This is exactly the kind of info I was looking for and is way more detailed than anything a medical professional has provided. That's interesting about desvenlafaxine.. I was on 100mg so I'm not sure how much it was affecting dopamine and noradrenaline compared to a lower dose? I really just don't understand what it was about desvenlafaxine that made it so effective for me considering it's mostly serotonergic like you say.. Maybe it was the dopaminergic effect since SSRIs haven't been particularly helpful for me.. But it completely eliminated my general and social anxiety, panic attacks and suicidal ideation. So now I'm a bit confused because clomipramine seems quite different to desvenlafaxine from what you've said.. lol. Considering I have issues with addiction (has ranged from sugar to alcohol to nicotine), I'm wondering if dopamine is an issue for me. I also forgot to mention that I have trichotillomania which seems to give me a kind of dopamine hit.

It's possible desvenlafaxine was a good fit for you and you needed just the amount of SERT and NAT inhibition it provided. But it might be interesting to try clomipramine and see if it works better still.

"Hey all. I deal with fatigue from chronic fatigue syndrome and long covid, but was managing it slightly better until they upped my lexapro dose to 10mg. I’ve also been steadily gaining weight despite reducing my calories massively-doing around 1400 a day. 

What else could I consider trying? They said I have major depressive disorder and BPD but I think I was just bummed about getting a chronic illness so idk if an antidepressant could help that!"	academicgirl	post	33.13582735453977	female	White	0.9977385997772217	na	na	na	5	depressionregimens

"Do any of you have parents that never take your side on anything and are always playing devil's advocate. I am 43 and I am still dealing with this with my mom. Most recently it's about a new doctor who won't prescribe me a drug I really want to try (Modofinil) and instead wants me to do Spravato which I don't want to do at this point. 

Instead of my mom getting behind me she says things like I'm sure the doctor knows better. Having had to defend my feelings and thoughts my entire life is just so exhausting on top of the exhaustion I already have from depression. I never feel that anyone has my back as a result of a lifetime of getting the devil's advocate from my mom. 

Of course no parents is perfect and we learn this more and more as we grow up. But I can see just how much these patterns have created a lot of problems for me. At 43 I am the weakest, lowest, most insecure I've ever been.  I wish I didn't need my parents support but I still do because I have 1 friend and not much of a support system."

"I would suggest your Mom is not willing or able to support you. Sometimes we have to filter the conversations we have with people. I suggest you google ""grey rock"" in relation to communication.

I limit my conversations with my Mum and Dad not because they won't support me but both are in their 80s and I think both feel bad I carry the worst burden of mental health in the family. Both have broad knowledge that I'm working hard after a MDD, but beyond that not much.

I find other places. In the past, lots of online forums. Jornaling has been important this time. If you can find a therapist who is a good fit that I'd great

Second, when your doctor is reluctant to change something ask why. Ask how long till you can review their approach. Rather than saying ""I want to try this"", I recommend saying ""I have heard about this combination, do you think it would be worth trying?"" This way you initiate a discussion rather than forcing a yes/no decision. With the doctor wanting to go a particular route ask why because it can help you to evaluate the effects and impact.

Depression is exhausting, I am the first to admit that. However we need to focus our energy on what we can change. You can change what you communicate, you can't change your Mom's response."	Evening_Attention_45	reply	na	na	na	0.9979590177536011	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens

I was recently prescribed Mirtazapine to be taken once daily at night. I also have some Buspirone (5/10 mg) I'd like to take in the morning and early afternoon. However, I'm concerned about the risk of serotonin syndrome, as many sources online have warned of this. If anybody has taken the two drugs at once, did you find them helpful?

"I can tell you that I'm suffering from depression and social anxiety since I was 15 (while symptoms occured in childhood already, I just didn't notice them in that time). I'm in treatment since I was 17 and with that trying to get rid of this illnesses, issues and suffering for years (now 23).

I tried like 14 different meds and 3 therapies (also CBT) already and I'm still suffering symptoms of depression and social anxiety - now it's just called treatment resistant depression, too. Plus my PDoc now even tells me, she strongly assumes that my mental health issues are of biochemical / physiological origin. I will add a list of the meds I tried in the comment section below.

So I wanted to ask you guys for an update in the world of meds for social anxiety. As said, I already tried many many many meds, but still I can't stop thinking about finally finding someone to stop this suffering and finally start living. On my list of ""still to try"" I still have a few meds, that you maybe have experience with regarding social anxiety (and depression):

**Antipsychotics:**

* Lamotrigine (Lamictal)
* Aripiprazole (Abilify)
* Olanzapine (Zyprexa)

**Anxiolytics:**

* Hydroxyzine
* Buspirone (Buspar)
* Clonazepam (Klonopin) - a strong one, I know, very addiciting but may be great if I'm able to only use them 1-2x a week max IF they even work for me, BECAUSE I already had Diazepam (Valium) & Lorazepam (Tavor) sadly didn't help much, I mean I felt the effects but I didn't really like them nor did they help my social anxiety or mood...

**Atypical:**

* Tianeptine (Tianeurax) - while this one can be addicting and I already have a kratom dependance
* Clonidine - which I could additionally need for getting off Kratom and finally forgetting it
* Lithium - I don't know why but my PDoc wanted me to try it but after one week thinking I decided not to cause I couldn't find any information about it getting used for non-bipolar depression or especially social anxiety (which is my main source of depression)
* Deanxit (Flupentixol & Melitracen)

**Antidepressants:**

* Nefazodone
* Clomipramine (Anafranil)
* Vortioxetine (Trintellix, Brintellix) - interesting as different being a serotonin modulator and stimulator instead of only serotonin reuptake inhibitor which never worked for me and I tried all the famous ones
* Fluoxetine (Prozac), Fluvoxamin or Desvenlafaxine - BUT as said all the other famous and typical SSRIs/SNRIs never worked on me, zero, and I really hate the side effects they can have and even be severe and permanent like PSSD, so I really don't want to try them again to be true

**MAOIs:**

* Selegiline (Emsam)
* Tranylcypromine (Parnate)
* Phenelzine (Nardil) - BUT sadly it's not available where I live (EU) so can't get it :(

**Don't even know about these, just saved them one day reading them somewhere, I guess:**

* Risperidone
* Rasagiline
* Amisulpride
* Tofisopam
* Trimipramine
* Doxepine
* Milnaneurax
* Pramipexol
* Ropinirol
* Mianserin
* Maprotilin

**Alternative therapies:**

* Ketamine therapy (Spravato, Esketamine)
* rTMS
* ECT
* Psilocybin or known as ""Magic Mushrooms""

**Supplements:**

* Sulbutiamine, Memantine or Bromantane - WOW, these all have good reviews for social anxiety but I just can't find any information about buying them in my country or if they even are legal, just nothing to find, I guess they are not available and illegal in most of EU?
* Guanfacine
* Bacopa
* SAMe
* Tongkat Ali
* Polygala
* Cordyceps
* Lions Mane
* Skullcap
* Akuamma
* Wild Lettuce
* Kanna (sceletium tortiosum) - I tried it many times but only sublingually and it never worked, maybe really has to be insufflated to work?

"I've been depressed for 15 years and have tried over 20 different medications. Current medications are Wellbutrin 450mg, Trazodone 300mg, Remeron 30mg (which I have recently reduced to, from 45). Decreasing Trazodone not an option because I don't sleep without it (up for 6 days levels of don't sleep). 

Still no relief, I've never consistently scored below a 15, and have been above 24 frequently since I moved here. 

I meditate daily, run 5ks 2x-3x weekly, am in therapy and have done all of these for years. I don't eat hardly anything I haven't made myself and don't drink anything that's not coffee, tea, or water. 5'7"" and 145 lbs currently.

I can't do anything. My apartment is a disaster, there was mold all over the dishes in the sink today because I never have the energy to clean it. I cleaned for 5 minutes and then gave up and went back to bed. I can't compose for any longer than a couple minutes at a time, and I couldn't even finish the consequent of a single phrase last time. I can't even finish single paragraphs of reddit posts. I just wind up looking at my phone for relief (it doesn't give me any) and scrolling between the same few apps through stuff I've already seen because I'm on my phone for like 6 hours a day. 

I'm in TMS hell with no end in sight. I thought I was authorized, turns out that was just for the evaluation. I waited 3 months for the psychiatrist visit to get the referral and another month between then and now.

I need some relief *now*. I am *out of time*. I'm already so far behind every other 26 year old and I'm not even paying my own rent without my parents' help. I just want to be able to set a goal and achieve it. And I'm not talking ""win a Grammy"" level goals I would like to be able to do the dishes and do my laundry and not have a nasty apartment. I just want to be able to sit down and compose for 2 hours, I would take 2 hours at this point.

Only thing keeping me here at this point is my boyfriend and my mom, who is very understanding and supportive, but lives 1200 miles away in a state that is currently doing a bit of a genocide against people like me.

I currently have absolutely no hope that anything will ever work because I mean, just look down below.

I guess my question is, I picked up some dextromethorphan with my Wellbutrin because of the Auvelity meme right now, would taking a bit of it with 450mg of my wellies fuck me up, or can I do that? Does anybody have any experience doing this?

"I’ve been on a lot of SSRIs. Most of them. They have all been the same, whether they’re supposedly “stimulating” (Prozac) or not. What happens is - they work for about a month. I have energy, motivation, anxiety is gone. This is initially, after a few weeks of side effects, and also when I increase the dose. But after a month or two, I start to feel numb, exhausted and apathetic.

But this ALSO happens when I decrease the dose. The same thing - energy, motivation, maybe a little anxiety returns but it’s manageable. I feel okay… Then a few weeks later I start to feel depressed again.

It’s an endless cycle where I only really feel good for a few weeks, when going up or down in dosage, and then the doc switches me to to some other SS/NRI which does the same thing.

Does this sound familiar to anyone else? Does it suggest that any other particular med might work for me?

"I've had similar responses to SSRIs/SNRIs... and sadly haven't found anything that's super helpful in the long run (sorry).  

What's kind of frustrating about this is that when I've taken new SNRIs/SSRIs and feel better very quickly, a lot of people want to throw Bipolar as a diagnosis at you since they look at the new DSM and see mania as a response and just assume it's mania.. nothing about my response to these meds has been manic, just improvement.

One interesting thing about protocols being developed for Psilocybin (at least partially Serotonin based in mechanism of action) is that for microdosing, most people are recommending every few days instead of daily so that your receptors don't desensitize to the response.  My Psychiatrist is surprised that this hasn't really been tried for antidepressants given that your body does adapt to the drug over time.  

I wonder what dosing a long halflife SSRI less often would look like..  I'm definitely going to try microdosing Psilocybin here soon.  It becomes legal in my state (Colorado) next year to use it in a clinical setting so maybe I'll just wait til then.

I'm starting to feel a lot better after some new meds and lots of patience, but I'm still insanely physically unhealthy after years of just being so depressed. I want to be more active, but I'm still so unmotivated and fatigued. I want to find some exercise I can do that's easy to start and is actually fun.

I want to find some exercise that doesn't feel like exercise and is just *fun.* Like a sport or group activity but I'm having a hard time finding a group. I like swimming, some group sports (ultimate frisbee, basketball, volleyball), dancing, and boxing. Also, I live in NYC so if there's anything specific there I would really appreciate it.	runchihiro	post	26.021608082807766	female	White	0.9868881106376648	na	na	na	18	depressionregimens
"I have a playlist titled ""Move;"" I add songs that inspire me to move my body, songs that I want to dance to. This is always the first step to get me out of a funk. From there, start adding planks and squats. After that, get a thick yoga mat; pull up Mat Pilates videos on YouTube or IG. Mat Pilates is free and the biggest bang for your buck. Sometimes I invest in Club Pilates for a few months, which uses expensive equipment... Ideally, I get motivated to take it to my own room and fitness space, down to the mat, because all you need is your body and some understanding of how to do the moves. A YouTube Pilates teacher will direct and educate you. I completely transformed my body with Mat Pilates. Add a dry sauna visit if you can get into a bathhouse over there.

But in the end I should have preferred sarcosine.

"Hey guys, 

&#x200B;

So right now I've been tapering down Effexor with the goal to get off of it completely. I've tried effexor, prozac, zoloft, and wellbrutrin. I've been having a very low mood and it's been really really bad lately so I have an appt with my doc today and I'm going to ask him for one of these. Idk which one I should try first. I've tried wellbrutrin before and it did help, but I was still depressed on it, so I would definitely need something else as well. I also have been doing at-home ketamine treatments since late December (oral troches) and I feel like it's helping but I'm just really down now. I'm not sure if it's because I'm tapering off of the effexor or not. So I'm a bit scared to try clomi or amitrptylite but I do need something super strong! I know wellbrutrin has helped before so I'm wondering if Auvelity would help even more. But I'm not sure if the Ketamine is working or not...

Anyways it's hard to keep track of what is causing my low moods but I def need something else that is strong. Any suggestions or experience from someone trying these medications would be great. bTW, I have major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, ADD, and some intrusive/obsessive thoughts (have not been officially diagnosed with ocd). My depression symptoms are fatigue, hopelessness, lack of motivation, lack of pleasure, bored/uninterested in most things, not excited about the future, easily aggitated/frustrated/irritated, negative thoughts about myself and life in general, not caring about making friends.

"Yes these medicines work. Side effects and effectiveness vary by person so sometimes a person needs to try several medicines before finding the right fit. Also be aware that treatments for depression and anxiety often take 1-2 months before effects reach significant levels and 1-2 weeks before effects really start.

Psychologists provide talk therapy. A family doctor or psychiatrist can provide medicines. So a good first step is bringing this up in private with your regular primary care doctor is a good first step.

For non-prescription options for these conditions start with educating yourself about cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness meditation (lots of books and internet resources, this is first line).

If you need more next steps you could try light therapy (exposure to daily sunlight or full spectrum bright light in early morning and sunset or other dark conditions at night), St. John's Wort (an effective SSRI but supplements are unregulated so doses aren't accurate), SAM-e a supplement used as 2nd line for depression during pregnancy due to its low side effects and good safety for mother and fetus. A number of nutritional  supplements like fish oil, magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin D are associated with improving depression and anxiety too.

Moving into stronger but sketchier nonprescription options: lithium ornate can be bought online as a nonprescription supplement. Dextromethorphan (the main ingredient if cough syrups like robutusin sometimes abused in 'robotripping') is technically over the counter and can be bought online. When paired with a CYP2d6 enzyme inhibitor Dextromethorphan becomes a powerful anti-depressant. This is the basis of the newly approved drug Auvelity. Mostly it would be paired with a prescription anti-depressants known to have this effect such as buproprion or duloxitine but if prescription drugs must be avoided, golden seal is an over the counter CYP2d6 inhibitor. There are a number of psychedelic options such as psilocybin containing mushrooms (illegal in most states to possess but spores are not illegal) that have incredibly powerful anti-depressants effects."

Antidepressants tend to make you feel numb rather than happy. Over time you notice your highs and lowered and your lows are highered, so you tend to start feeling flat and emotionless.

Over the counter in the USA there’s Silexan few if any side effects (I got none) and clinically proven to reduce anxiety.

"Really happy for people if the meds work but I was told by multiple MDs who treat more holistically that it's criminal how the system keeps you on these forever when they're really short term fixes that are not resolving the root causes of the sickness at hand. I tried 8. None of them worked and genuinely made me much sicker although my mind was numbed out. I believe there was also study that showed that a lot of SSRI's are not effective (my brother is in med school and told me about it. I'm sure I'm overgeneralizing it but essentially a lot of this stuff is not effective the way we're told they are.)

You don't want to fuck around dosage for stuff like this either. Even prescribed, I threw up and had really bad side effects. Literally destroyed my health and I looked and felt awful. Essentially cured myself of depression using a brain recorrecting technology called Cereset and was able to taper off all meds and sleep aids/THC. But that shit really didn't help me, even when prescribed by a psych, and I would hate for you to guess/check and experience the same symptoms.

If medication can help, by all means utilize it as a resource. You can probably see in the comments that a lot of people are helped by it but there is also a population of people like myself who do not see the benefits of SSRIs and are sometimes harmed by taking them. I also had parents who kept me from seeing a psychiatrist/psychologist and I completely understand your desperation. I was there once too, asking this exact same question. But I absolutely know that if I had tried to self medicate on my own, I would have royally fucked myself into a worse place."

"In our place psychologists aren't eligible for providing prescription. They can only refer to a psychiatrist and probably work together to get what works for the patient.

Regarding medications. I don't know whether there are OTC drugs are there or a minor can take it unsupervised (considering OP's post). If you can go to a general physician and explain your situation and ask how to proceed. Any counselor, mentor, teacher even can help in such I hope. There are government hotline there to help you in cases like this. They can help to navigate this kind of situations. 

Now the question is whether the drugs have side effects or not or they work or not. First any chemical composition can have side effects. Even the paracetamol can be detrimental if not administered properly. Because they are bunch of chemical composition and they can react differently with our body with different conditions. Second do they work. We need to understand that modern medicine is very new science compared to its counterparts. The most up-to-date information regarding our brains are very recent and it's a still ongoing process. So they have one hypothesis, which they will test on different variables and then collectively decide whether it has any working effect or not. Unlike blood or any other organs it's difficult to just take one sample from any patients brain and see what it is having deficiency of. I think this is why it's important to have a clear idea what we are feeling and what we want from any such treatment. And then have a working relationship with the specialists to know whether their treatment is working or not and then move from their. 

For example I my case I wasn't not even able to get out of bed 7-8 months ago. I can't express how I was feeling. It's so horrible. But after over 2 years of consultations with multiple doctors and counselors I now atleast don't feel like getting drowned in the Pacific."

As far as I know it is not. It cannot be taken within 2 weeks of an MAOi. Most other contraindications are relative rather than absolute. It's FDA approved as auvelity for depression but my discussion regarding its technical availability as an over the counter adjunct to wellbutrin or Cymbalta is a totally new and sketchy/not generally recommended use. Definitely the discussion of using a nonprescription CYP2d6 inhibitor (golden seal, grapefruit juice, etc.) is some wild west self-medication. However some people truly can't get to a doctor and depression threatens both life and living so I think there is a select group who may benefit from access. The dose is probably similar to auvelity's dosing scheme bit also a person could start low and titration up slowly for safety.

"Sorry I'm late.  My memory could be wrong because this was a year ago: After 2 or 3 weeks I was less (or not at all) suicidal, I was not as anhedonic and experiencing fewer mood swings. After that I came out of the depressive episode, my worst in years. I changed my meds around the same time so it's hard to know what helped long term but it helped me quicker than the usual antidepressant wait time which matters when you're suicidal. I also have this problem where after months of suffering and when it's got really bad I try something,  and generally assume it was a success, rather than it being a coincidence where my episodes are coming to an end after the worst period. It's hard to know.
 I did have skin side effects. I'm going to try it again while adjusting to this med change to see if it stops the suicidal episodes.

"Well tramadol can be quite addictive since it's a opiate.
Good for you that you want to come off it.
There are 2 major antidepressants that get prescribed for pain and depression. One is amitriptyline and the other duloxetine.

Amitriptyline is an older drug and can has quite some side effects like drowsiness, constipation and dry mouth but is really effective in treating pain.

Duloxetine is a so called SNRI which often is prescribed for diabetic nerve pain but also works great for chronic back pain on a low to medium intensity.

Both drugs should lift your mood up and don't form addiction.
Although duloxetine is hard to taper off from because it has a quick half life and that may lead to medication withdrawal symptom ( it's not the same as addictive craving, it's more a physical reaction to tapering like vertigo and nausea. )

There are other options but those two are the most common ones

"i’m sure the last thing you want to hear about is another med (i’ve tried 19, i get it), but lithium is a godsend. i was constantly suicidal and definitely a danger to myself but when i got to a therapeutic dose of lithium is was like a switch flipped. it’s one of the only meds that can help with suicidal ideation rather than having the risk of increased suicidality.

i’m on 7 meds in total, though i’m doing a cross taper so it’ll be down to 6 in the next couple weeks. i found i just don’t respond to antidepressants; if you looked at my med list, you’d assume i’m bipolar. i have mdd, gad, panic disorder, complex ptsd and adhd but lithium is definitely my main medication, along with vyvanse (adhd) and lamotrigine (mood stabilizer). i’m also on guanfacine er, trazodone (sleep, not mood), sertraline (tapering and taking for ocd) and viibryd (titrating, also ocd because sertraline didn’t work).

it’s not exactly what i imagined for starting meds but that’s where i am and i’m okay with it. anyway, lithium 100%.

also, if you’re not in therapy please please try it. finding a therapist that’s a good fit is sometimes difficult (i got lucky on the first try! you could too) but worth it.

Nearly no doctor knows about that, yet. First studies showed direct connection between VitD-Level and mood. For me(!) this is 100% proved. I have constantly monitored my VitD-Level, Vit-D-intake and my mood. High level, bright mood. Low leve, bad to very dark mood.

Disclaimer II: An intoxination with Vit D is possible. So slowly ramp up. Measure (online, doc, pharmacist/drugstore) and increase, measure, increase...

I have done this since 2022-02-23. For me this is very fine and I will continue forever, I guess.  
The old/ actual recommendation is 2.000 units per day for an adult.  
Newer studies say: 40-60 per kg bodyweigth and day.  
My intake is 17.000 units per day. A value, my family doctor and endokrinologist became nervous, at least. Blood values are in higher but healthy ranks, VitD and others.

There is also a lot you can learn about how to handle, understand, and heal the depression. The medics are the jump start only, to bring you in a state, clear enough to work.

a close family member of mine was suicidal. They started on *outpatient* ECT. They had to have approximately five treatments, then they got on a good regimen of meds for upkeep.

They have never had to go back for another course of ECT and have been fine. In fact, I would say the depression has been in remission for many years since then. 

There was slight memory loss around the time right before an after the treatment. But no long-term memory loss.

I cannot find the source but maybe it's just a general idea. Medication can only do about 30% of the work, the rest is usually therapy. This definitely does not apply to every case but there's a lot of studies that discuss the benefits of therapy vs medication. I see medication as something that helps you be able to do the things you learn in therapy. If you have depression because your thinking is not reality ('I am a failure because I do not have a good career' vs 'I do not need to base my self-worth off of my career'), medication won't change that. But it might help motivate you enough to try to change it. So, I think if meds help you 30% that is really good already.

"You seem to have a pretty mature view on where you're at.  If you feel a bit better and more capable, I would suggest not changing for a bit and attempting to work on other factors that might be contributing to your depression.. including accepting and meeting yourself at where you are in life.  It's much easier to do that when medicines are helping, and changing very stubborn and persistent thought patterns takes time and effort.  

You don't have to be on medications permanently, nor do I think any combo of meds is going to make you feel perfect.  Most people do not feel good all the time, but they are not chronically depressed or anxious to the point where every bad day just feels like this chronic illness that hijacks the mind.

Most people will feel some negatives from medications, and you just have to weigh the pros and cons the best you can.  Journaling a lot about what you're going through can help provide perspective on what medications are doing to your baseline.  Taking a break from the torment you're placing on your body and mind of going through those tapers/adjustments can be super helpful if you find something that is at least helping for the time being. 

Keep working on your mindspace, and try to be as scientific as possible about the changes you are making with medications.  There are always more options, but nothing will probably ever be perfect."	Literatelady	reply	na	na	na	0.003947011195123196	weak	no	no	na	depressionregimens

I relate when you say that a mood stabilizer won’t jumpstart you out of a depressive episode. I am on a cocktail of meds for MDD and am not in remission, nor have I been since 2019. However, I’m not in the hospital. I believe that one thing that added to my last major relapse in 2019 was switching from lithium to lamotrigine because my kidneys were failing (lithium will do this if levels are not checked regularly- always make sure your doc monitors your levels). It’s worth looking into non-antipsychotic mood stabilizers if your DX is pure MDD.  Typically a crossover switch of meds is a good approach (tapering off the old one while adding the new one)	Literatelady	reply	na	na	na	0.003947011195123196	no	strong	no	na	depressionregimens
"I went off of one medication (Rexulti) and had a horrible anxiety meltdown that led me to quit my job. I went off because I was feeling okay, and I wanted to get the weight gain down. I went back on it a few months later. But, I have been off it again about a year later, and this time it hasn't triggered anything bad. I think this time, it's different because I replaced the Rexulti with something. I did this by getting on the new medication first (Wellbutrin) then slowly getting off the Rexulti. If I didn't feel the Wellbutrin was doing anything, I would have stayed on, but I was confident enough the Wellbutrin was helping.

If you want to try, it might be a really good thing. It could also be really bad. I experienced both. I think most importantly, you have to see if you're in the stage of your life where if it is bad, you will be okay. If you can't work, will you be able to afford life? If you get really low, will you have friends to check in on you? Do you have a good relationship with your doctor where you can call them as soon as you think it's too much?

"I tried dopamine agonists (Pramipexole and Ropinirole) in the morning and they made me extremely tired at daytime.

My intention was to experience a stimulant effect because of dopamine but I felt the opposite. Any explanation?"	Aeon81	post	8.413822468560863	female	White	0.999358594417572	na	na	na	7	depressionregimens
"A lot of D2 receptors are in fact inhibitory; they all are in terms of their cytometabolic effects, but many are also inhibitory of glutamate efflux, which actually mediates their effect.

Another factor is the agonism of pre-synaptic receptors, which leads to reduced release of dopamine. As these receptors downregulate due to continued agonism, the effect may become more stimulating.

Owing to these factors, partial agonists can sometimes even be more stimulating, though they have effects not limited to D2.

I find brexpiprazole more stimulating, though it's messy in some additional ways not limited to direct receptor-bound effect."	Aeon81	reply	na	na	na	0.999358594417572	no	no	no	na	depressionregimens

"Yer, this is definitely true. A lot of people mistakenly presume that all dopamine receptors will positively boost activity in the meso-limbic system.

For those curious about the underlying mechanisms, the activation of D2 receptors plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal activity. This is achieved by the inhibiting of adenylyl cyclase/cAMP production, as well as the modulation of potassium and calcium ion channels, ultimately leading to a decreased firing rate of neurons. In contrast, D1 receptors work to increase neuronal activity by engaging in the opposite functionality to D2 receptors.

The cAMP secondary messenger system is vital for various neural functions, as it can activate a range of intracellular signaling pathways and adjust neuronal excitability. When D2 receptors are activated, they reduce the production of cAMP, which subsequently decreases the overall activity of neurons."

"Hey, I've had depression/anxiety since childhood and I'm mid-late 20s now. I've been on medication for about 8 years? Mixed results. Throughout my treatment, I was comforted and educated a lot by other people's experiences, so I thought I could include my own. I'll talk about my current medication regime now as I also want some other perspectives:

Wellbutrin XL 300mg, taken in the morning. This medication has finally made me have energy!! I had been so tired every day I could take a nap any time in the day, for many years. But the Wellbutrin made me feel.. Human again? I didn't really need or want to take naps anymore, and sometimes I felt a bit hyper/bright again and I have times where I like to be silly and light-hearted. My depression is bettered a lot. However, oh boy, my anxiety is BIG. I don't think it's just because of the Wellbutrin though, because my anxiety was big before. I think after going on Wellbutrin though, I feel the anxiety a lot more emotionally - I cry so often, probably 2 out of 3 days. I also want to cry for silly things, like a heartwarming story or a melancholic song. I don't experience any side effects other than that. All-in-all, Wellbutrin is a good time. Doesn't cure me, but has definitely changed how I feel.

And now chronologically, I was on:

\- Pristiq, I don't remember the dose but I went pretty high - it worked okay for the first few years but it definitely felt like it wasn't doing anything maybe 4 years in. Oh, I also was on Effexor a little bit before that, but I don't remember anything about it or even why I switched to be honest. I think it just took a little bit of weight off my depressive episodes and helped me with motivation. I know a lot of people make the withdrawal from Pristiq sound horrid and I think it is if you go cold turkey because I always KNEW when I missed a dose because I'd feel the buzzing in my head 12hrs past the missed dose. But, I tapered off + replaced it with Wellbutrin so it was actual fairly uneventful.

\- Abilify, I also don't remember the dose. I got onto this on recommendation from my mental health professional friend, because I just couldn't get myself stable enough emotionally to make any progress in my therapy. I remember this really helped - my moods fluctuated a lot before this (err, well never in a positive way, just like, from kinda-sad to ahhhhh-gjafisjf-i-hate-everything-sad) and after it's like I didn't get \*as\* sad. Or more like, even if I did get really sad, it didn't control me as much. HOWEVER!!! This was when my weight gain started. I was quite thin before this - due to lack of motivation/desire for self-care + self-punishment, I did not eat very well. After this medication I was able to eat better but I slowly gained pound after pound and could not lose it. After a while, I did switch to:

\- Rexulti, in an effort to curb the weight gain. It didn't seem to do anything with that, though maybe it slowed it down? I did still gain a few pounds, it's just hard to say if the weight gain plateau'd or not. I also have PCOS but so far my bloodwork indicates that shouldn't affect me much. This was basically the same as the Abilify I guess. I got off of it when I got on the Wellbutrin. I did once go off of it without replacing it with anything (I thought I was doing well so it would be okay! But it turns out repressing past trauma is not the way to 'do well'), and it was a horrible horrible time because I had many a mental breakdown. Haha.

\- Pregabalin, I went on this a bit after I stopped the Rexulti, I don't really remember why but we were trying to see if it would help my social anxiety. My psychiatrist said there are unfortunately few medications that work with SAD but this could. It didn't though lol. I tried for several months, went on a pretty high dose, then just went off of it and felt the same.

\- Zoloft, to be honest I don't think this did anything. OH EXCEPT, my dreams became insane. I was already a vivid dreamer, and after I started Zoloft it was like every night's dream was a fever dream. I wouldn't mind that in itself, but it did affect my sleep quality and made it really hard to snap out of my sleep-state. I slept in a lot. I've been off of it for 3-4 weeks now actually, and I still feel that side effect. I'm hoping it goes away ASAP. I think it's getting better though.

I know I wrote a lot and I don't know if it will help anyone but I hope it does! At least it helps me self-reflect. There is a lot I didn't write here too. I think my experience with medication has been okay as I never had any terrible side effects other than the weight gain. Been fortunate in that regard I suppose?

&#x200B;

Side note: Has anyone tried rTMS?? I live somewhere that could cover it with public funding or something (or maybe 'cause I'd be used for a study, IDK lol). However I'd have to go in 5 days a week for several weeks, which sounds. Crazy. But if it's really that amazing then I'd do it."

Both are useful as mood stabalisers and may assist with anxiety.

"There have been so many times in the past where I've felt tempted to buy ketamine from the deep web due to all the studies saying it can really work for treatment-resistant depression.

Hey guys! I have tried many anti-depressants in my lifetime. I just recently started one about four to 5 weeks ago. At that same time I had a lot going on in my life. A lot of high stress. Fast forward. Things have calm down in my life. But I missed a dose of 20 mg of Vilazadone on Thursday morning. Took it again Friday night when I remembered. Friday I take a nap at 4 PM and don’t wake up till about 7 PM. I usually take long naps, but this was different. I physically could not get myself up. I tried even trying to sit up in bed. And I would just fall over and go back to sleep. Nothing I did would keep me awake. It wasn’t until my dog laid on top of me that I actually got up. I was just so tired even after that that I went to bed pretty early. Needless to say my sleeping since then has been pretty heavy. I keep feeling like I need to nap or hit snooze. Like last night for instance, I got solidly eight hours of sleep, but I desperately wanna go back to bed. But here’s what I started to notice and was starting to freak me out a little bit. I don’t know if it’s because I spent so much of my weekend dreaming but I’m having a hard time differentiating things. Like I have intrusive thoughts, but there’s a part of me that’s like we’re still asleep? I know that consciously I do know that I am very much awake. But I feel like I’m wandering around in this weird twilight zone. I genuinely feel crazy. I feel like I can’t connect to anyone. Like I’m lost in my own little world. Hell I just started crying in 711 for no reason. This is not how I normally am.. I even feel like I have a hard time finishing sentences at work. I feel so out of it.

"Of course it's possible. You think back in the day when there weren't any anti-depressants people stayed depressed their whole lives? No. Some were able to beat depression despite not having drugs. 

First, identify why you became depressed in the first place? Is it due to social isolation, not achieving your goals, loss of a family member, childhood trauma ?

Second, socialize more. Socializing is good for your mental and brain health. The brain literally starts to deteriorate without social stimulation. 

Third, exercise! Jog/run for at least 25 mins a day. Running does wonders for depression. It's great for your mood and brain. 

Four, learn new things and meet new people and do things that make you happy or used to bring joy. 

Five, improvement your mindset. I recommend reading the book learned optimism. Those who become depressed tend to be pessimistic. Become more optimistic. Don't personalize negative events and see them as permanent.

"These meds shall only bring you in a state you can work with your therapist.   
You can learn to teach your brain how things shall be judged, prioritzed or just ignored.  
You can teach your brain, how to think and how to feed it correctly.  
Example:   
""Hello son, do not forget your sports bag again in school"" What will happen? Sportsbag stays in school. Why? it is a negative instruction like   
""do not think on pink elephants"",   
""driver please do not drive to (Manhattan)""   
""I must not forget the milk in the supermarket""  
Better versions:  
\-Hello Son, when you are done with sport, grab your bag and bring it home, please.  
\-Please think on a giraffe  
\-Please drive me to Manhattan in an convenient way.  
\-First thing in the supermarket is getting milk, we have zero at home.  
All these are way more concret, positive, with condition, easy to handle for the brain.  
Try it! The wording of your thoughts/ speach makes a BIG difference.

Many goods advices already mentioned, I fully support BLACKZHEUS here.

Some more:   
\-keep your vitaminD  on a high level. (for me this is the biggest lever to good mood.)  (Warning: overdosing is possible! Make tests all eight weeks until you have your daily does.)   
\-read printed books. Several senses aktive (view, feel, smell), imaginagion, steady stream of info, ""painting the scene in your head"" all good for the brain/ soul.  
\-Get your \~8h of deep sleep.   
\-In two weeks at least one night you can sleep without an alarm, so you are fully rested.  
\-Help other people in a way, you can easy handle. This makes feel good.

"Identify the real cause. It might be something totally different than what you are aware of.

Just an example I've been depressed most of my life and I'm almost 40 and just recently I have discovered that I have trauma from early life that I had totally forgotten or rather suppressed. It's to early to say yet but this might be the root cause of my depression and hopefully when I have processed these traumas properly I will also solve my tendency to be depressed.

"Yes I think so? 

I‘ve been dealing with depression for 10 years and now had like the worst episode ever 
And the last year was me being mostly bed bound and not leaving my apartment for sometimes a few weeks.

And like after taking a year off and starting therapy It’s finally getting better.
Psychiatrist also told me without medication I won’t get out of it and told me I’m not even in a place where I could start therapy.

"The problem with depression is, (in my opinion) sometimes the mood is soooo bad, you can hardly ""function"" (= go to work, laundry, cleaning, food) on a basic level.   
So I did not question me, did not believe in me. I thought: If I ""function"", all is fine. I was just a emotionless robot. (ough)  
Meanwhile I have learned for my: If I only do ""function"" something is WRONG.  
Now for my the \~daily check\~: Do I spent time on things I like (Motorbike, books, cooking, movie, sport) or do I just kill my time?

"Decades ago I tried Adderall and felt great for the first couple of days. Time didn’t drag, motivation, etc.. But then the dark days would come in and I experience real cycling. Added abilify and I just felt agitated and worse. I actually ended up in the hospital. 
Much later I tried Ritalin. It sparked occasional weird annoying brain wave sensations. I was also on Lamictal. 
I’m not regularly bipolar but obviously I am at risk. Mood stabilizers have all caused my mood to worsen or induce increased agitation. 
I take Modafinil for chronic fatigue. I’ve noticed magnesium has made that smoother for me. 
Over the years I have tried everything- including ECT, TMS, ketamine, low dose psilocybin, supplements. 
I don’t drink anymore (the depression hangover isn’t worth it for me)- but that seems to be the only time where my mood is elevated and time passing isn’t like nails on a chalkboard. I also have crazy inner restlessness. Kind of ADHD-ish but able to focus.

"I have a very similar story to you.. tried hundreds of psychiatrists and even regular doctors. 
Serotonin meds and even stimulants only made me worse.. it wasn’t until I tried Wellbutrin that I felt such relief of my symptoms.

Wellbutrin is basically nicotine minus the cancer and COPD.. both increase dopamine and noneprinehrine which is why nicotine is one of the most popular and addictive substances.

Too many doctors ignore dopamine; dismissing it as an unimportant neurotransmitter when it’s the only reason people feel pleasure or motivation.

Low dopamine can cause depression, no motivation, fatigue, confusion, trouble concentrating, and even cravings for salt/sugar (can also cause binge eating and eating disorder symptoms as the brain is desperately searching for a source of dopamine to relieve these symptoms).

Once I got on Wellbutrin all my depression, anger and anxiety went away. It even stopped me from binging. 

I’d definitely try it; you may have the same brain chemistry if not similar to me; especially since your story is almost identical to mine - even down to the brain zaps (weird electrical feeling).

There are activities that drain your confidence, some that keep it the same and some that build it. Categorize them like that and try to minimize the ones that diminish it. Example daily shower early in the day builds confidence. Having a dirty living space, lowers confidence.
