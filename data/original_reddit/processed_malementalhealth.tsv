"Story Time, because this is bothering me. I was driving home from the gym. I get to this green light (right turning lane) and this car in front of me stops. I have to slam on breaks a bit it’s no problem but I kinda put my hands up like “wtf”. You know? 

Just out of my view was a pedestrian walking across this small crosswalk into the middle of our street. The guy basically looks me in my face and says “yeah, stop b—“. As I’m sitting at this intersection, the guy is mean mugging the whole time, recording my car and cursing me out basically. 

It took everything in my power not to flick him off or anything like that. Tbh, I feel somewhat soft for not returning the same energy in kind. That just didn’t seem like that big of a deal to risk getting my windows bashed out, going to jail or worse. I already have pretty bad Agoraphobia, and a few other things. So, I’m a little paranoid about it tbh.

"I know that while not matching energy might make you feel less than most of the time it’s better to deescalate. You never know what that random guy has or where his buddies are. It took me a long time to learn pride was in a lot of situations my enemy. Not the ass hat being a ass hat. It sucks but it’s true. It’s harder and more “manlier” to walk away. Words hurt but not as much as knifes, 2x4’s, or bats and a million different things people grab. Oh and the law. Even if your in the right sometimes the law isn’t. So I try to get away from the situation 100% of time now. 

If your in a corner and have to fight. Like you have to have to. Then hit first and don’t stop trying hurt them until they are down or running away. That happens but is rare I hope.  

Long story short man. Not fighting can be harder than getting my ass handed to me. Losing fights suck but it didn’t feel as bad as the first couple times I walked away from a situation. Now though I’m so happy I did learn to walk away. All my “friends” are either dead in jail or burnt out.

I took martial arts for a number of years and my instructor often told us a story about a fellow instructor who was one of the top-ranked in our style in the world. 

That man was outside his dojo and someone came up and pushed him. Confident in his ability to defend himself, they started to fight. The other man pulled out a gun and shot him.

Didn't matter that he was an amazing fighter. He let his anger get the better of him and then he got shot.

"25M and I've never been good with women or dating, missed out on pretty much everything in high school and college. Never felt like I was a viable option. Women never showed interest and the women I was interested in never reciprocated. Over the last few years, I've wanted to turn my life around and start getting my shit together, and for the most part I have. Cut out bad friends, habits, and life choices, started therapy and taking care of myself, lost a ton of weight and got into health and fitness, picked up some old hobbies and started new ones I really enjoy. However, I'm still lacking in the relationship department. It is something I want to get better and want to work on, but it just feels like such a mountain to overcome still.

&#x200B;

So after getting into somewhat good shape and taking care of myself, I guess I'm kindof attractive now? I don't necessarily see or believe it yet, but there's been a few times where my friends have tried to encourage me to go talk to a girl, literally telling me I'm one of the best looking dudes at the bar we were at. But my brain doesn't really believe it. I ask why? she's either going to not be interested, or get to know me better and decide she's not interested. I know that's dumb and whatever but its what is going through my head. I get nervous and my heart starts going crazy whenever I am in these situations.  I just can't comprehend a woman taking a chance on me, a guy with literally no relationship and minimal dating experience. It's never worked out in the past so my brain is expecting the same result and tries to avoid it (?).

&#x200B;

Also watching TV or movies or whatever, if young love, romance or sex comes up I get the same shitty feeling about myself because it's something that I totally missed out on. Like I was watching a show where two women were talking to a guy about how horny teenage girls can be and I just was like, ""wouldn't know"" and it made me feel like a loser. I get I can't change the past, I missed out, oh well. But I don't want to keep missing out, I want to change and put in the work for things to be better and be different so I don't miss out on this time of my life too. But with my experience level it just feels like a huge obstacle and red flag on top of me not having any idea of what I'm doing that'll just scare them away or I'll screw it up every time.

&#x200B;

I think at the core its that I never felt like I was a viable romantic option and that mindset is still holding me back. I used to think it was from obesity, shyness, or whatever other reason, but it persists. It's the feeling of never being picked, never being the one that someone wanted to spend time with or the one that they'd take a chance on. Like above, even hearing a girl talk about how hot a dude it or how much they're into him, my stomach sinks since I've never had that about me. I feel inferior to most other guys in regards to getting a womans interest in a real place, and on OLD it's just hell. Then I know if I get into anything, all it takes is one little thing or word to get the ""ick"" as they say, which feels very likely considering my lack of experience.

&#x200B;

I know this isn't a dating sub, not asking for literal pickup lines, but help with the mental health aspect of it.  Just trying to get some momentum going on it and maybe I can figure it out, but atm it just feels like a huge mental block that I'm a ""late bloomer"" (a term I don't love).

"I wouldn't say you're a late bloomer yet. I met plenty of guys your age that had never had a relationship because they were too busy with school, many.

I don't have advice, but there is a quote that I do believe in.

""You have to love yourself before you love others.""

Keep working on yourself. People tend to find others when they are their best selves. Usually this is a hobby, event or something.  And it tends to happen when you're not expecting it.

You seem to have some female friends. Perhaps you can open up to them about how you feel. It's possible they might see something in your behavior that you don't see, that can be fixed. Like, maybe you never make eye contact, or maybe your conversation skills are lacking. Things like that say ""unapproachable"" or ""taken.""

It sounds like you need a new therapist though. These types of damaging thought patterns are what they are supposed to help you address."	BeefNChed	reply	na	na	na	0.9919639825820923	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"I relate to this way too hard. I’m nearly 28 though.

You’re probably aware of this, but thinking things won’t turn out good actually makes it more likely that it won’t turn out good. If you “fake” your mindset into thinking girls will be interested, then they are more likely to be interested. That’s the confidence and “fake it till you make it” that people talk about. Every time you think “what’s the point, they won’t like me anyways”, that’s bringing you down and people can sense that so they’re more likely to not be interested. People like happy confident people not sad people that are always down on themselves. You have to make yourself think that they will be interested in you, and if you can’t make yourself think that through pure willpower then you have to “fake” think it. Think it as a joke, and then it’ll become real.

The lack of relationship experience may not be such of a turnoff as you think it is. Some women care about that, but a lot don’t. If they’re the type to care about that then they’re probably not the one for you, plain and simple.

These were the things I was able to change my mental about, and I still haven’t had success, but I do feel more comfortable around women."	BeefNChed	reply	na	na	na	0.9919639825820923	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"I’ve (23M) came to the conclusion that for the past 3 years; I’ve been suffering from a horrendous imposter syndrome. Which has been slowly poisoning my soul. I’m riddled with self-doubt regarding my body, intelligence and my place in the world. Which results in me overanalyzing. All of this stemming for childhood bullying and torment. So, I feint this austere and unbothered persona to everybody. While I internally, decompose. I can just feel myself becoming more bitter at the world as I type this. Which will lead to my absolute demise. To be completely honest, I’m feel a bit suicidal.

My biggest fear is being alone and forgotten. All of the pain that I’ve endured has driven me to prove them wrong, but the “expectations” that are thrust upon me are burning me out. I have an array of hobbies and ambitions. Along with striving every day to become a better young man, spreading kindness and achieving something that will live on for a while. So, I never become that toxic POS that I was 3 years back. Even tried therapy and counseling but I can’t receive them any time soon. However, I want it all NOW! Haven’t achieved anything worthwhile in a long time and I’m SO tired of feeling invisible. Every-time that I believe that I’m taking a step forward, I take two steps back the next day. The work that I put in isn’t enough, it NEVER is. Which is just feint as humility. For context, I was dismissed from uni in 2021 due to poor performance. A byproduct of poor mental health. I paid off a $6k debt and returned back this Spring. I performed MUCH better, but my advisor screwed my aid over and now I can’t return until I pay off $9k. Like I said, NEVER enough. Tbh, I have no faith that I’m ever going to get it right and be happy. So, I self-sabotage by choking under pressure in almost every challenge in my life. Yet, somehow, that high stakes want to go harder. It’s weird.

Circling back to expectations, this also branches towards my relationships. Idk how to differentiate between who I’m meant to be and how others perceive me. Which feeds into my social anxiety as well. I’m a tall, chubby but muscular dude. So, most people would look at me as a protective figure, right?? In addition, I’m surrounded by so many beautiful (inside and out), strong-minded and kindhearted souls. People who I’d the world are going to do great things. They’ve helped improved me in way that they can only imagine. With their help, I’ve found my spirit again. However, there lies a question…why the hell would these kinds of people want with a chubby, ugly and mediocre guy like me? I’m just the kind & funny one, right? Do they really like me as I am? Or do they only like my persona? Kinda also the reason why I've never had an official GF even though I've been romantic and sexual with a girl before. Still, I work my hardest to be the greatest friend that I can be to them. To support and be loyal to them, expressing thoughtfulness and love. However, I always feel as if I’m always one fuck-up away from losing them. Leaving me as just a memory. I feel like none of them truly understand me.

I know, I’m probably very unhinged or even weak minded. To believe that I had a brave, hardworking, badass bone in my body. Guess I’m not the cool person that I daydream as lol. I’m so flawed and depressed that it’s pitiful."	GiftedScenario	post	21.420272643340024	male	White	0.996918797492981	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth

"I have always wanted to be a father. I have always dreamed of having a family of my own. I was raised without a dad in my life until my stepdad, who is more a father than anything I’ve ever known, stepped in. I watched my mom suffer and I hurt for her all my life. In the past 7 years of my life, since I graduated high school, I’ve been on a real deal hell ride. I’ve made stupid decisions, fallen in with bad people, and traveled the country just being a vagabond or a vagrant.

All I’ve ever really known was suffering, anger, chaos, these things were the basis for my young life and especially the constant theme of my young adult life. When my GF(now, 24F) came into my(now, 25m) life 3 years ago, she came in at a time of turmoil and emotional stress. I was a NEET, I had no prospects, I had no job, I had just met my bio dad and moved in to be with him for a while and I was living in a camper in his backyard in south Florida with no AC. I was hopeless and just waiting for another stupid adventure.

She was the best thing that ever happened to me. She came from a home that seemed very well put together, something I never had, her family is very ‘traditional’ believing in values of courtship and the like. From the beginning, we were long-distance, and we’ve been long-distance now for over 3 years. 

I don’t want to stretch out the events of those years in extreme detail, but just know I was a fool for most of it. I never did anything to truly hurt her, but she was more patient with me than anyone else would have been. In the past year and a half, I’d like to mention that I have finally achieved a lot. I paid off my debt, and I’ve made advances in my career with EMS. I’ve come a long way to see my dream of being a husband and father. 

Currently, we live six hours apart, she lives with her parents and I, mostly, live alone. Every once in a while, around every other month or every other week, we will see each other for a weekend, either she comes down here or I go there. 

She came down around a month ago and stayed with me, much to her parent's disapproval. I slept with her and we recently found out she is pregnant. I know that some of you will be concerned due to the circumstances of our distance as to whether or not it’s truly my child. However, I know that fear, but I trust her; I know it’s mine. 

She’s been in the throes of heavy anxiety and fear, I’ve been preparing and planning, looking at options for more growth sooner so I can financially support us and hopefully buy or rent a home and get her covered with healthcare. I decided I would go up there to be present when we told her parents, for many of you it doesn’t seem like a big deal, but in a few short words, I can only describe her parents as strikingly overbearing. 

We went to a pregnancy clinic first that had to be free because her parents are, quite literally, monitoring her bank account. We also had to be cautious because they track her location as well. We confirmed the pregnancy, we moved forward with healthcare plans, and we talked about our future together, and what was the best option. We decided against abortion and adoption, and I promise you I assured her it was her decision, I am not bullying anyone into doing anything. Abortion would emotionally devastate me, but I know that’s her decision, not mine. 

Then the time came to tell her parents, and there is a lot to unpack there. First, they both walked out of the room, her mom sporadically coming back in to yell at the both of us. She, my GF, was not able to talk for all the sobbing, so when her mom asked “What now?” I did my best to go over our plans together. Her mom cried and got upset, and I was left by her side with her in an emotional wreck. 

Finally, her dad comes back in and demands that I leave. Now I want you all to know I’m by no means a peaceful person, I was in the Marines, I’ve worked in state prisons, and had my share of struggles with others. Yet I complied, I didn’t want to make a mess of things, I didn’t want to make things messier than they already were. I was polite, I bit my tongue, said “Yes sir” and began to leave. As I was leaving he decides to call me a thief.

A “Thief of what?” you might ask, I’ll tell you what that fucker meant. He meant his daughter, and albeit I can be understanding, he was upset. She isn’t a physical possession, though. 

Again, I bit my tongue and began to leave. To my surprise, her mother helped me out the door and grabbed some of my things to help. She was very gentle, and when I had the time to talk to her, I expressed that I never wanted to hurt anyone. I never knew what a happy family looked like, and I begged her not to hate me. She cried and hugged me. Yet at the same moment asked me not to talk to her daughter for a few days.

Of course, there was no way I could follow that instruction. I drove a little ways away and parked close by. I waited for my girlfriend to text me to let me know she was safe and to see if she would be coming with me. Around an hour later, I received a text from her telling me that her dad demanded that she never speak to me again and that he would never let me be near her again. I asked if she was going to pack her things and come with me, and she said that they (her parents) were talking about divorcing and that she didn’t want to harden her heart against them. Her Mom and Dad had argued about whether or not I should marry her, her dad didn’t want me in their life. 

My GF told me to head home for now, and that despite her parent's demands she would stay in touch regularly.

The 6-hour drive home was hell. Between screaming, crying, and phone calls with friends and family. I slept at a truck stop in my car. Smoked two packs of cigarettes and thought several times about ending it. It’s been hell. I had to replace a tire and my windshield, totaling around 500 dollars in gas and repairs just to be told that I’m a piece of shit. I’m only on the second day of this.

Her dad told her, just tonight that he won’t let her see me until the baby is walking. As a father, he knows the kind of pain he’s inflicting on me. I have a hard time letting it go, I’m afraid and angry. I’m sad.

I don’t know why I’m coming here with this story, I don’t know what I aim to get out of it. I know what to do, I know my game plan. I have cried til wailing, I have prayed, and I have worked my hardest towards trying to fix this. I don’t know what I want, maybe just someone to tell me I’m not the bad guy. I want my girlfriend, I want my baby, I just want to be seen as anything but the bad guy they’re making me."

"Hey man, i was in similiar postion.

First, i would advise you to start tracking calories using MyNetDiary and avoiding junk and sugary foods.

Second, start doing some exercises. It can be jogging. At first it wont be much, but as you become consistent with running or other exercises like push ups, dips or lifting weights if that you like. You can easily turn fat into muscle.

Third, having a girlfriend won t solve your problems. Relationship will only add you problems. Im saying from my own experience.

Don t off yourself because you will create more pain around you after you pass away. Specially to your family.

Third, find any job. Gain experience. Let it be shit job no matter and you will gradually find what interests you."	TheKeyDre	reply	na	na	na	0.9976690411567688	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
My man, you are 21 years old. This is not the end nor the finish line. For me, life didn't really start until I turned 20. You are the only one who can decide which direction your life should go. It's all up to you. You know what you have to work on for a happier life. Question is, how bad do you want it? I dont mean to sound mean or cold, but this is the reality of life. You're the only one capable of saving you. Find a picture of yourself as a lil kid and take a good look at him. Do it for him.

"Both my parents have become obsessed with certain online media.

My mother is extremely Catholic and listens to priests talking all the goddamn time. I enter her room and there's figures of Mary and Jesus everywhere and the only time I don't hear prayers is when she leaves the house. She genuinely thinks that the mother of Christ just casually shows up in Italy every now and then and acts like all her problems happen because I don't want to be dragged along to church anymore.

My dad on the other hand has been obsessing over these videos of deadbeat dad's complaining about their ""feminazi wives"". I literally asked him ""what are your plans this weekend?"" And he just replies with this link to a YouTube video of a guy in his car talking about how this guy's wife turned his kids against him for a half hour (couldn't bring myself to watch the whole thing through but that's the gist of it). If it's not those shitty videos, it's long ass essays about how he was abused by my mum for being asked to get a job or help with the housework and how I need to force her to give him everything she has, and if I tell him to piss off he goes on about how mums tricking me into hating him or something (the thought of me having my own thoughts and opinions as well as the idea of something Not being my mum's fault is too difficult for him to comprehend apparently)

"Here’s the truth

We’re all brainwashing ourselves at any given moment

Spend long enough in any environment and you become part of it, whether it’s good or bad

This goes as deep as to rewiring our brains to think a certain way

The secret is to be able to brainwash yourself how you want to be 

Just remember that it’s better to have parents like that than those who are abusive and brainwash you into thinking you’re not good enough 

I’m a devout Christian myself but if there’s one thing to be aware of, it’s that just telling people to believe something rarely works. 

Find masculine role models who inspire you and allow them to brainwash you with a strong work ethic, mental fortitude and a passion to pursue purpose"	dandy_dandy_dandy	reply	na	na	na	0.9993273019790649	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"That sounds difficult. It isn’t uncommon for people with similar traits (sounds like A cluster personality traits if you want to read more about this kind of behavior) to get together so you’re definitely not the only one in this kind of situation with their parents. 

It might be one of those things that you’ll just have to accept and there’s not much you can do about it. If they are susceptible to these ideologies, you’re not going to be able to undo it and I wouldn’t expend the energy trying. I think it’s possible you could become the object of some amount of paranoia from both people if you push it too much so weigh the costs and benefits in doing so. 

If you still want to be in their lives, I think this may just be a component you’ll have to live with. I’d try to just focus on the positive aspects of your parents. Maybe the things you have in common, time you spend together, etc. and just try to avoid being a part of the aspects that make you uncomfortable.

I've started going out with this girl for a few months as friends basically. We joke around and talk all day everyday about everything. She has a very odd approach to men, hating most but always mentioning me as the outlier and that she really loves me. My grades, health, and a lot of things improved from her presence. Every time I tried to engage in something more of a romantic approach she would just shoot it down. This is odd to me considering how physical she is to me. I noticed I started obsessing in an unhealthy way and it has been killing me. She is extremely cutthroat as a person and does not mince her words. I am extremely drained mentally from my own overthinking and I really want to be with her. Another part of me that is torturing me is that she is the one who is more dominant in our friendship so I am unsure if that adds anything on top of it.

" 

As a child, I always thought - ""If it doesn't work, just try, try, try again until it succeeds. Even when your back is against the wall, fighting hard will almost always guarantee victory!""

As an adult, I realize that persistence in certain context, sometimes, leads to dire consequence. Coupled with this long standing depression, I feel like giving up every day as soon as I open my eyes to see the sun cascading it's warm amber rays through my dingy, dirty window. Nothing seems to work out anymore, and every time I feel like I take one step forward, something pushes me 4 steps back. I always thought I was at the bottom, but now I see the abyss. I haven't lost literally everything, but I lost everything I truly desired and cared for, everything I worked so F\*\*king hard for, aside from my small family.

There is no more hope for someone like me. I'm not genetically, nor mentally superior, and my last relationship ended with an occasional sharp, conical, throbbing pain in my right temple and twitching in my left eye. I've noticed the severe mental decline, and loss of executive function, to which I was already at a deficit with ADHD.

I've been in a form isolation, unsure on how to even spark or continue conversation with others. Unsure on how to mentally stimulate others so they will return. I don't engage in many social activities - not like I get invited much anyways, and when I do, I will occasionally experience extreme anxiety and tend to overthink, leading to a flake. My friends rarely reach out to me anymore. I feel like if I don't at least try to interact with them in a positive manner every once in a while, everyone will be gone. My family just leaves me alone, and can not comprehend what I feel, no matter how I try to explain it. Where I used to be encouragement for everyone who surrounded me, I am left a useless nuisance, and a severe disappointment.

I quit my job after the aforementioned relationship nearly a year ago, and sparsely do odd jobs to earn little cash flow to keep myself alive as I have been blessed to have family that provides housing for me. I've been rejected for every job I've applied for, and can't seem to land interviews even when they say ""You're the type of person we're looking for""

I don't even engage in, nor do I find interest in really.. Any hobbies anymore.. I used to be passionate about technology, and the advancement of humanity, working out, video games, but now I sit an empty, hollow shell - feeling my muscles atrophy and watching my figure fade into an unimpressive state. Able to feel physical hunger, with no desire to eat, and every bite just feels agonizingly slow and painful. Even my favorite foods now taste bland. The world greyscales, my mind, body, and spirit fading into oblivion as I cry internally.

I have been suicidal for as long as I can remember, but never showed this outright to anyone aside from select individuals I felt I could be comfortable around. As of a decade ago, I don't tell anyone how I truly feel. If I do, I realize the trauma dump will make those individuals stray far away, forever. I don't think I can outright unalive myself, too much of a coward to find out what's on the other side, but I feel as though my body will eventually give in on it's own, very soon.

My biggest fear used to be someone I held dear to my heart, perish before my very eyes, with something I could have done to help. Then it became, ""I don't want to die alone.""

Now, I feel no fear.

"I'm an entrepreneur, and after a couple of years of burnout, my condition has significantly worsened 3 months ago, and I've been diagnosed with moderately severe clinical depression. I've been having an indescribable feeling of sorrow, anxiety, apathy, helplessness and emptiness; in the first week of the whole episode, it was even hard to get out of my bed. For the past 3 months, whenever I tried to work (or even just thinking about work), I would experience immense anxiety, fear, anger, as well as physical symptoms, such as massive headache, body tremors, and faster heart beats (and one time, almost hyperventilating). The trauma around anything remotely related to work has been significant (I scored 70 out of 80 on DSM-5 assessment); to date, I still can't open/reply email, or think of anything/anyone around work at all, since all of these give me tremendous fear and anxiety.

Around 6 weeks ago, finally decided to take a month off work (totally offline), to try to recover. I was supposed to go back to work after one month, but I've continued to struggle, coupled with flashes of suicidal thoughts. To make matters worse, there was some emergency at work (happened during my leave) that I would need to attend to -- and it was going to be extremely stressful. Hence, I decided to take a couple of extra weeks off, and during the past six weeks, because of the severe trauma, I've eliminated all direct contact with folks at work (including my business partner) and my friend was helping as liaison point.

As I'd have to come back to work soon -- regardless of my decision, whether to officially extend my leave, depart from the company, or something else -- I've been getting hints that folks at work, including our shareholders, have somewhat been upset with me, as I've been fully offline (in the past, I've always been very online & responsive even during weekend and time off). I briefly shared with them that I'm ill and would need some time off, although I didn't share the details as I was afraid of repercussions to the company (except my business partner, who knows everything). But now, I've a feeling that they would start blaming me and pinning me for all the problems that have happened at the company over the past 6 weeks (and there were a couple of them, while I was away).

A part of me feels guilt for taking time off and went completely offline, as I know some people were probably upset by that, but at the same time it was something I needed, as I was desperately struggling, and who knows, if I haven't taken that break, I'll probably not be here writing on this forum now. I also question whether I should have been more transparent, but there was no one ideal choice, and my business partner wasn't supportive of transparency at that time either.

I would advise against transparency in the corporate world in regards to mental health, as some people see it as a vulnerability to exploit, some see it as weakness, and some just can't comprehend what you're going through so they believe you have control over it and may believe it to be an excuse.   


I believe you made the right sequence of choices.  


I recommend returning with confidence and renewed vigor. No guilt should be felt as it just brings you down further into the abyss of depression. State that you feel much better, and try putting great effort into your work if you want to keep the career.    


Understand the stress of returning may be elevated for a brief period of time, but it is up to you to push through if you want to see success. If you feel the burnout coming again, find ways to elevate your mood and reduce stress like venting and exercise. Hell, maybe after a month, start inviting coworkers and shareholders out for a drink. This can mend relationships fairly easily and reduce anxiety going forward.

>All I ever wanted in life was to be desired

Don’t base your expectations of happiness on others, you will lose every time. I made that same exact problem and it didn’t help me, in fact it brought me down even more. The want to be desired is natural, but don’t do things in life to be desirable. Do things because 1: you want to do them 2: it gives you a goal to work towards continuously.

> people don’t even notice how far I’ve come.

Why is it their job to point out your accomplishments? You sound like you have been able to get a lot done, and you should be proud of that, but again your basing your value on how others see you, and you will find that you will be disappointed with other people when they don’t care. Value is something you give to yourself.

I had an abusive upbringing with a very feminist mom who used to shame, guilt and humiliate me to become a better none-patriarchal man. The outcome for me is that I really struggle with taking the lead around women and being sexual around women. 

I’ve worked a lot around the doormat/nice guy behavior that came out of it. However it’s mostly about work and platonic relationships. I tried seeing a sex therapist but we did not talk so much about sex as she did not want to be explicit.

I’m still a virgin pretty much and out of frustration I bought a sex doll a few years back as I wanted to experience some kind of intimacy before I die. Sex work is illegal here so it’s not an option. Also I’m bred on shame around exploiting women so it wont work.. for various reasons I got rid of the doll recently and wanted to try meeting a real woman now. 

I’m starting therapy again next week and I’ve got quite a lot of matches on tinder, even a superlike, so I might be able to find a date. 

Are there any workbooks or guidance for how to work on one’s sexuality when it’s roadkill like in my case? I’ve not experienced any physical abuse, its in my head. I have some triggers like pubic hair which reminds me of my mom, but other then that its mostly a trust and shame issue."

"I'm sorry this is something you're struggling with. I think one of the biggest lies around sex perpetuated by the mainstream media is that men always fulfill a more doninating role in the bedroom. There are plenty of women that do not need you to ""take the lead,"" so to speak, especially if it's someone that you've built mutual trust with. Just give it time!"

It's better if you don't put a ton of stock into relationships or sex honestly and I'm not saying that because you can't do either I'm saying it because it's so hot and cold sometimes it will just drive you nuts if you take it too serious.  You have to approach them as like entirely optional things or it's just going to pull you under fast.  For someone like you I think you need to go slow just build things.  If something falls apart or whatever shake it off.  Have something else in your life that is not a relationship (like a hobby) that you can lean on.  Also honestly there is nothing wrong with finding ways to be intimate on your own.  You shouldn't feel ashamed of what you were doing I think it's ok and you are taking care of a basic need. Just because you don't have a relationship or are struggling to get one should you ignore your sexual well being.  You should take care of your needs even if that means without a partner.  Men get shamed too much over this stuff and it's not fair.  Your body needs to do what it needs to do.	Annual_Anxiety_4457	reply	na	na	na	0.9624660611152649	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"First you need to be ready to heal. That's going to mean stop pointing your finger at your mother and start using that hand to build.

Next, yes women tend not to want to mother men. But women do want a man who listens, cares, and response to them. I'd be willing to bet your upbringing gave you a lot of strengths as well. Play to those. Like they don't want to clean up after you or wipe your ass. A woman who knows what she likes is going to tell you, and that isn't mothering it's communication.

At any given point, though, it's important to also ask ourselves how we are putting ourselves out there. Are you asking women out? How are you meeting new people? Are you maybe using dating apps? What sort of things are you doing to make yourself available to a potential partner? 

Also, it seems you're feelings on things do tend toward holding women to account for how you feel. It may be useful to heal from that before moving forward with too much.

Finally, when you feel like it and when you feel good about yourself, the key is to have a good time. If you're trying to get laid or get a relationship it's not going to go well. Women notice and tend not to like it much either way. Find out who your best self is, be that self, and let the women who you shouldn't want anyway filter themselves out.

"just know i’m not talking down on myself. i’m being honest and truthful and realistic in telling my life experience 

does everyone here hold onto insecurities or is it just me. the difference is mine impact my life. my situation is a bad one. small penis size. dating is tough. a relationship would be even tougher knowing i can’t compare to past guys. knowing i’m not the best in bed she’s had knowing i’m 100% the smallest because it’s obvious i am everytime. i’m THAT GUY. every women experiences this guy. yea he’s cool and amazing but sex isn’t as good and he’s small. nobody wants to be THAT GUY but i’ll always be. i’m not saying it has to be massive but it just can’t be super small like mine. since the first time i ever had sex i knew it would be an issue in my sex life with most partners i can’t have normal sex 

any advice on how to accept being this person for a women in the bedroom? as a man it’s hurtful shameful and embarrassing to be this man. sure sex isn’t everything. but it does matter a lot and having to make up for it and compensate everyday of my life for not being enough is challenging and not a good feeling. i can’t make up for it forever. i can’t be extra funny everyday, i can’t make a lot of money and give an amazing life. so if i’m not giving amazing sex with a big size that she wants and i can’t be extra funny or extra good looking. how do i really make up for it. i don’t see a way i can compete with those other guys. some dicks are amazing pleasure wise some aren’t. sadly mine sucks. it’s not ideal it’s not a preference it’s not what they are used to."	bddguy1	post	20.596997829193036	male	White	0.3044164776802063	na	na	na	2	malementalhealth
"Hey mate. I taken a look at your profile and you have asked about this a lot. 
I always suffered from the same feelings as you have. My penis is same size as yours when hard. Plus I was a grower not a shower. So bit of a turtle dick :). I had been told by many people it was a normal size. Even went to doctors to ask when was young. For me it didn’t matter what people would say I was fixed in my head that it wasn’t normal. still to this day I still suffer from the way of thinking. When I was young my dad pasted away when I was 15. So I didn’t have him to ask.  I was even didn’t want to live and it effected my whole life. As I’m not caring about my health. 
Even after they did that dick length average report online. I think it’s a body dysmorphia thing that develops over time. I suggest you speak to a therapist that specialises in body dysmorphia and do what is in your power to help your problem. It’s not your penis it’s what you believe in your mind. Please don’t be like me and let a thing like this wreck your life. 
It’s the same as people with eating disorders thinking there fat when they are not. So again you need some mental support for this to fix it. I hope this helps you and make you realise you need help with your mind not your penis. Take care mate.

"my emotions are just too much im tired of it. its been like this ever since I quit heroin, which i didnt do for that long but it got me into criminal trouble unfortunately. ever since the withdraw of that, i got emotional and then never really regulated again. i feel like I broke my brain. 

last night i went from being the happiest ive been in weeks to suddenly cleaning my gun and getting this immense urge to kill myself which then made me so angry like really the most mad ever so i started breaking things in my apartment. after that i sat down and wrote a suicide letter and did another line. 

during the comedown i just felt stupid and humiliated but I tried to act normal. did some more coke and ended up staying up all night writing letters, getting more angry. 

i know this is just a mental health thin but i feel and felt pretty bad physically too. I’ve been sweating so much it hurts to piss and I have had no appetite so i didnt eat all yesterday and then late last night after I came down a bit I forced myself to get some food and that was a BIG mistake as I feel like puking.

how can i toughen up? this isnt who I want to be. I need my fucking hand held with everything. I never used to be like this but ever since I got out of prison, lost my dad, and then my gf (not her fault so don’t demonize her she was the best thing that ever happened to me) its like i feel so emotional and moody and weird. 

I feel like im a kid and i just want my dad, then I get so angry about shit in my life, then i think about my gf and how she would take care of me, and I realize that’s what I want I want someone to take care of me… pretty sickening realization 

How can I toughen up… i need to get a grip guys. any advice"	HMNI_Adam	post	11.37572041156129	male	White	0.9972882270812988	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth

"I think I've hit my breaking point and have no where else to turn. 4years ago I moved to a new city for a new job and had great drive an motivation, went from being a fat stoner to losing over 100lbs, working my way up in my career and building a community. Over the last 2 years everything fell apart, from a close friend playing with my emotions the same time I found out I had a brain tumor(benign), to realizing that the only reason I got my best friend from college a job at the same place was because he wouldn't take no for an answer and visited me every weekend which has led me to a lot of regret. Prior to getting him the job I was planning on buying a house and had my financials in order. Now 4 years later I'm more in debt than ever, made a poor financial decision on a condo purchase and have no will to continue because I realized how much of a mistake it for my own growth to bring him to this city and company. I should have been 10 steps ahead of where I am today, same shitty apartment, honestly went backwards as a human because I didn't realize at the time we were at different stages in life, lost the first friend I made in this new city(She was the first person who has made a city I've lived in feel like a home instead of a random place as i've lived in over 10 cities), haven't been able to concentrate on anything because all of this has been eating away at me. If only I had that complete fresh start when I moved here would things be different, my inabiity to be firm on saying no to people I cared about brought me here. Now I don't even have the will to do my job, take care of my cat, gained all the weight I lost back, pray that I have a heart attack or aneurism every night because I can't keep going. I'm exhausted. 

I watched myself go from being the happiest, most outgoing, motivated person, happy to help anyone, from almost launching a company, building a community, building a career. To now, where on the surface I can still put up a facade and interact with people but inside I'm dead and I just don't give a shit anymore. Barely even respond to texts, just waiting for death. Even after going to intense weekly therapy for the last 2 years, I just don't have the ability to care anymore. I can't even take proper care of my cat who has been my only reason to continue for the last 7 years. I'm tired ya'll, I'm nearing my end."	loonybhatia	post	27.35180963918281	female	White	0.9992499947547913	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth

I joined this group because I’m a 25m with BP2, however I’m seeing a lot of posts about men that are down on themselves aesthetically, and it’s hampering their self confidence. I just wanted to say to the men that feel this way. You are valid. Your height, your voice, what you carry in your boxers, your hair, your fat, your muscle. The list goes on. I just want to say that if there’s something you don’t like about the way you look, ask if it’s something you can control. If you can, let’s get to work on it. It takes time with some things but that journey you put yourself on will be worth it for the growth alone. I feel we also tend to put ourselves under a microscope with insecurities. Other people are not as focused on you as you think. And before anyone tells me “oh but I’m only this or that and can’t do this, nobody will want to date me”.  Not with that attitude. If you’re really feeling beat down please seek help to adopt different mentalities and ways of thinking and being mindful. I don’t want to sound like I’m preaching but even at my heaviest (260 as a 6ft male) I can reflect back and realize I wasn’t getting play from the women like that because I wasn’t comfortable with myself. I’ve been between that weight and 175, I’m 200 now and between all those weights, when I finally got confident it became so easy. Idk long rant I just hope we as men can start being happy in our own skin instead of comparing to others.

"I think this is a vent. 

If I feel physically threatened, my mind goes to a dark violent place. 

So for example, my wife and I were in the park on a date and a random guy sat nearby and started to heckle us.

I spoke a bit with him but it was clear he wasn't going to leave us alone and was going to continue being an ass. We got up and left.

I feel ashamed that I couldn't convince him to leave (or scare?) him off. I'm left with a strong feeling of rage and I fantasize about murdering him. I imagine the confrontation going beyond words and I pretty violently murder him in many imaginative ways.
I have 0 experience fighting and not the biggest person. So a fantasy. And these thoughts live in my head non stop for days after. I can still feel adrenaline pumping and I get so angry and feel murderous intent towards random guy McGee.

Is this a reaction / defence mechanism my brain puts up to deal with feelings of insecurity and shame? 

Is this just a normal human response to being threatened?

How do I stop ruminating and stop these thoughts from keeping me so on edge? Whenever I talk about this the emotions are brought up again, and I feel like the only way forward is to eventually forget this happened.

Also, while we got out of the situation with no harm done, could I have handled it differently?

I’m not sure if you could done better or how to deal with it. I have similar issues. Some thing that help the though are physical activity of any kind the more the better. Walking and Lifting weights help me get a lot out. When there’s plenty left after that just got find someone you trust it good therapist and talk it out. If you need to take action take them. If not.

">I have 0 experience fighting and not the biggest person.

This is most likely why you arrived where you are.  
People have an aggressive and potentially violent side if things add up, this is part of our nature, we can all deny it but that does not make it go away.

So if you never let your aggressive side play(especially when people are pissing you off) it starts adding up resentment, things stay inside and slowly nudge toward a boiling point.  
And at some later time they will reach that critical moment where it blows up and you more then likely loose control over it, many many people have died on account of that very blow out. (I nearly killed my sister who crossed my boundaries one too many times)  
Luckily you are aware this is happening, so you have an early warning system.

So you need to find outlets for you anger/aggression/violence, physical expression works well for me, venting about things that piss you off is also a good one.  
And I give you fair warning, you are already plenty heated internally, meaning things will be kind of wild when they finally get an outlet. But the pressure does gradually come down."	luna_bea_tuna	reply	na	na	na	0.02155100740492344	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
Toxic masculinity. That’s all this is. You should always avoid to fight people as best as you could nowadays, since most people don’t fight fair and most likely carry weapons with them.

26 M. I've been feeling really off recently. I had a falling out with my friends a year or two ago and I have had trouble getting over it. It made me sad and led to me breaking up with my long term girlfriend of 7 years. I felt like I had so much now I'm not left with anything. I have a job that makes me on the road a lot. I can never sleep but when I finally do get to sleep I sleep all day. I don't want to get out of bed. I feel like everything gives me anxiety, just getting out of the house is tough. I don't eat well, haven't worked out in a while, and sleep varies. Maybe I'm just looking at anxiety wrong. Is this normal? Maybe it's just life and I'm not handling it well.

"First of all, please be kinder to yourself. What you went through is fucking tough and how you are reacting is perfectly valid. I understand because my situation is eerily similar. 

Secondly, try as best as you can to process everything that happened, one thing at a time. If you can't get to a therapist, try writing on a journal. You need to feel this deep sadness that you're going through to be able to get past it. Only way is through. Cry if you have to. Cry hard. I never thought I'd be the type to have to stop on the side of the road to just absolutely wail and scream and punch a kick in the car, but I did it. And it helped. A lot. Writing on a journal will help you process these feelings and be aware of what you're feeling instead of this kind of haze surrounding these emotions. These aren't a fix, but they will help and you need all the help you can get. I'm going to try and start meditating again in hopes that would help me in any way, maybe you should try it too.

Lastly, try and take small steps towards getting out of bed. I'm kind of contradicting myself here because I can't get myself out of bed too lol. But start off small. Force yourself out of the bed. Then maybe just go outside to get some sun, that will help. Then slowly make your way to maybe taking a walk just to get moving. Trying to force yourself to do something big like going to the gym straight away will seem too scary and too massive of a jump that will most likely trigger your anxiety. Start small, and congratulate yourself with every step you take.

My mantra that I've personally been taking on is ""stop feeling sorry for yourself"". Regardless of whether we decide to be sad all the time or actually do something about it, life is going to keep moving forward. Time doesn't stop for any of us. You owe it to yourself to not get left behind.

Start to train your brain to do things because they benefit you. Not your friend, not your ex, not anyone. Do this for yourself, you owe yourself that.

It's a tough road we are on now, brother. But you can do this. Take your time as well. You had a life before everything fell apart, there is no reason for you to be unable to get back on track. Please be nicer to yourself and understand that this will pass, but you have to help yourself."	Accomplished_Amoeba9	reply	na	na	na	0.9982635378837585	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"Lot of good insight from garbzzz who commented already.  But was going to emphasize the importance of taking some small steps every day to re-engage with life.  The good news, based on what you've said, is there is a lot of room for things to get better...even if it's slow and incremental.  

I do think you should talk to a healthcare provider and consider if there are medical or therapeutic interventions you want to consider.  

But also, commit to yourself to build a healthy routine...e.g., go to bed at the same time every day and plan to wake up by 6 or 7.  Go for a walk, jog, or lifting session at the gym daily, limit or eliminate drugs and alcohol, etc.

Relationships may be the most important things in life - take steps to start rebuilding. With your former friend either clear the air or put it completely behind you.  For potentially new friends, look for ways to make new connections."	Accomplished_Amoeba9	reply	na	na	na	0.9982635378837585	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
Today i was crying the whole time while working. I’m a janitor so I’m usually alone and nobody can see my pain. But it’s just reoccurring memories. There was this woman. She touched me. Sexually molested and raped me. Just because it’s fun? Or maybe because she saw i was different? Anyways I’m a selectively mute autistic guy that hasn’t spoken a word to anyone in school or in public. I only feel comfortable with my family. I feel that i will not last long because of this feeling of self hate and the hopelessness. My family members are toxic, I’m the only child and my parents divorced when i was a toddler. So i feel very isolated from everyone and everything. I feel so disgusted just existing wallowing in my own shit. Every day I’m slowly crumbling, my bones, the chronic pain, the boredom. And the trauma always has me crying until my pillow is soggy. I can’t be successful because of my extreme anxiety. So no college or future plans for me. My parent’s small cleaning business is the only thing i can do because there is absolutely no interaction or communication required. Just physical labor. Never had any friends, not even during my childhood. I mostly used sign language in special needs classes. But later i forgot most of it so they just gave me a tablet. Recently i made a online friend that lives on the opposite side of the world from where I live. I feel like i wouldn’t be here making this post if i hadn’t met that person. But i don’t think i can make it. I feel so hurt. I even developed a severe eating disorder last year and i was almost hospitalized. I went to a different country where my aunt lives and she helped feed me. But i felt guilty. Not wanting to eat because i felt that i don’t deserve to be fed. Like the way my abuser treated me like a fucking trash can and forced me to eat shit. I’ve mostly recovered from my ed because I got tired of people telling me that i need to eat. And now i just feel numb all the time. I don’t even have time for my hobbies anymore. Fuck me.	arChrisan3	post	9.531914970754068	female	White	0.9982054233551025	na	na	na	3	malementalhealth

Wise words. My sisters boys. One was 11 years of age when he told his mother he just wanted to die. He was bullied in his social group of friends and by his brother. He was told to stop complaining as he grew up. I could see it would only make him panic and Catastrophise. Which feed the loop of what was happening. He started on antidepressants at 11yrs old and help him over reacting. Only now at 16 and is finding his way. Via doing DJ music. Now he feels part of the “cool crew” in his group of peers. It’s amazing how how a person is excepted in this world effects a person’s mental ability to grow and be happy rather then being focused on why I don’t fit in and not wanting to live.

"28 years old 
No girlfriend 
Dead-end job
Autism 
Living with my parents
Don't drive because i have been in two car accidents that scared me
Live with my parents. 

I work in a sort of gardenig company that drives groups of people with special needs or people with mental health issues around and lets them do menial tasks(cutting hedges, using a weedwacker all day, raking leaves, etc) it's tedious and boring... but i guess work? Its from 7 in the morning until 16:30, in the winter we get to start a 8 in the morning and they knock a day of because there is less work.
Even though i have a regular highschool diploma no regular employer will hire me. 

The job is ok but it seems like a job that they can automate and i wonder how much of my time i'm wasting at this meaningless job. 

I have some things going for me in life.
I play classical guitar and i can even play difficult pieces when i put my mind to it. 
I have some friends that i hang out with. I try to do at least one exercise a day and i try to eat healthy. 

I just find that my autism is this thing that makes me seem odd or strange and that certain people can just tell that i'm different than other people, Especially when it comes to dating or interacting with women. I know that women have to be cautious around men but when 90% of my ineractions with women are met with disgust it does kinda leave me bitter. 

Any advice on how i can improve my life or things that i should incorporate in my life to make it better?"	noboru1	post	32.78110942162256	male	White	0.9991236329078674	na	na	na	4	malementalhealth
"If you're good as you say you are at the guitar, you could always try busking at whatever major city is closest to you.

Go early in the morning as businesses are opening, maybe find a place that would appreciate classical music like a coffee shop or restaurant with outdoor seating, and play for as long as possible to see how much money you can make in a day. (You might make more money playing on a weekend).

If you feel the money you make is worth the time and distance traveled, you could probably save up for something nice."	noboru1	reply	na	na	na	0.9991236329078674	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
Hey maté sorry to hear of your struggles. I have a idea regarding to be around ladies and maybe get comfortable with talking to get a date or other. You say you play classical guitar and can learn some difficult songs. What about playing at a restaurant a classy one if possible as background music. In breaks pop up to the bar. I’m sure some ladies will start up a conversation. You may get a lot of mature ladies. But that’s not a problem. They could teach you a thing or two 😬. Is there any bars around you could play at. Even if you did it for very little money. I’m sure it will help with your social skills. As most people will be approaching you. Dress nice. Yeah just a idea. Another idea is joining social clubs. At least this way you get to make friendships before maybe relationships with ladies.  The ones you make friends with for some time. Ask there advice on some feedback of how you act and if there anything they can think you may need to adjust. One last thing. I saw a tv show. It was called Love on the Spectrum. They had dates with many couples and also got some coaching from people who specialise in helping people with autism. If there’s not one close you could do it online as they did this in the show as well. Good luck.	noboru1	reply	na	na	na	0.9991236329078674	strong	no	no	na	malementalhealth

This is something that I think about a lot. I think for abuse shelters and mental health facilities it should be a no-brainer, but about other things like clubs, gyms, etc I've heard conflicting opinions. Some think that it's a third world type of approach and it brews hatred between the sexes (though I think you can make the exact same argument about female-only spaces), and some would argue that a more targeted and inviting approach can encourage more guys to join, find friends, and hopefully better their mental health.

"For hundreds of years men went to male only spaces in lodges and clubs and fraternities for the crucial need of male validation, acknowledgment, and sharing of experience for masculine growth, as well as role, modeling and mentorship. 

In 1978 in America, the Supreme Court allowed states to ban male only spaces with thousands of very beneficial institutions, disappearing overnight. Fast forward to today, and we have record high anxiety, depression, and suicide's and men. 30% of men have depression at some point in their lives, 10% have depression daily, suicides are now 80% men and are four times the number of women, friendships among men are in a state of crisis. 15% of men do not have any close friend at all which is five times as much is 30 years ago. 56% of men don't have three friends.  

This is a crisis of epic proportions. There are men's groups that may be local, but also can be accessed online such as the Mankind, Project, and the true brother organizations. You can also start a brotherhood of your own locally by calling up guys contacting them, and saying hey, let's get together on a regular basis a once a month.

Personally, I'm not a fan of them but only because I don't feel comfortable in them and that's a masculinity thing but I'm glad they're available. 

If you're afraid of being percieved as not welcome to mixed sex spaces I find that strange and wonder what it is you're doing.

A strong majority of straight relationships seem to contain a gendered code of conduct that strips individuals from having a sense of creativity in their relationships. For one, basically all straight proposals are all done in the same way: man gets down on one knee with ring. On the other hand, gay relationships seem able to incorporate creativity and personal freedom in how such an event is done.

"Heterosexual relationships aren’t by any measure doomed to be rigid or monotonous. To say people being straight only have tedious and laborious love lives is just absurd. Are there more deep set traditions in Hetero relationships? Of course, but almost all of them are relegated to marriage and that stems from marriage traditions centuries again whereas of course gay relationships wouldn’t have them when gays have only been able to marry in the states for a little over a decade. How the 2 actually choose to love, interact, express themselves, experiment, learn, and live together is most definitely unique to them and natural to them. 

It’s also worth mentioning the majority of relationships are heterosexual, gays are a minority. The sample sizes aren’t even remotely comparable to draw accurate conclusions between them. 

Nor is there any actual evidence gay relationships are actually any better off simply for being gay, evident through how lesbian marriages show rates of more domestic violence and divorce than gay relationships.

Gay relationships go 3 ways; super poly, one guy being more masc and the other more fem, or it’s just it’s own thing.

"Hey you.

I’m directly talking to YOU.

You probably feel like you don’t deserve to be here, like other people in the self improvement community are _better_ than you, further ahead that you, more _special_ than you, _cooler_ than you.

2 personal friends of mine (who everyone else would say is elite) told me, one after the other, 2 days apart, that they don’t feel like they deserve to be in the communities they are in, full of other go getters.

One in particular even said he’s jealous of the other guy and compares himself to that guy all the time – and then that other guy told me 2 days later that he feels like a massive fraud who doesn’t belong.

I told one of them all of this and he said, _“I’m so insecure I never woulda guessed people look up to me.""_

It’s a great point – I’m insecure about a million things. Of course I am, I’m human. I’m not perfect.

And a tonne of my clients tell me that they're insecure and don’t feel like they belong, like they're not cool enough to be trying to get what they want in life. I’ve lost count of the number of people that feel like they don’t belong in various self improvement groups, whether that is “people who are improving their finances” or “people who are losing weight” or just generally “people who are working on improving themselves”

I’ll tell you right now, cool has nothing to do with it. “Good enough” has nothing to do with it. “Deserve” has nothing to do with it. Success is EARNED, it is not deserved. If you want success, if you want to reach your goals, it doesn’t matter whether you’re good enough or cool enough or deserve it – in fact, you WON’T be good enough at the start.

You haven’t EARNED it yet.

All that matters is you keep pushing forward, keep striving for more, and never ever quit.

Quite a few years ago when I was a bit more of a newbie to the self improvement thing, I always felt like I didn’t belong. Like I wasn’t good enough. Any success I had in the past, I would put it down to just being a “fluke” and I’d “gotten lucky” and sooner or later they’d all find out I was actually a loser. I didn’t feel like I could ever make it.

I didn’t feel like I could ever be cool enough.

The same thing with my finances – I’d always been in debt. I never felt like I deserved _not_ to be in debt. Even when I got to a point where I could go full-time with coaching, I felt like I was an imposter. A fraud. Like I’d just gotten “lucky”, whatever the fuck that means.

News flash, most people who succeed feel like “I just got lucky” for a long time, until they finally internalise “No I EARNED this”. But that takes time; often months, sometimes years. It’s so normal, so common, to feel like an imposter and a fraud even after you succeed at something. But I promise you that fades eventually and you realise, “I worked hard to get here. It wasn’t luck. It was hard work, a stubborn refusal to ever quit, and just taking tiny little baby steps towards my goal every day. I deserve to be here.”

I’m talking to all of you that feel like this.

You fucking deserve to be here.

You’re so much better than the average guy.

You care enough to fix your issues.

You’re aware of your flaws and you’re actively working on them.

You have the courage to admit you want something more from life, you don’t want to be complacent.

You’re terrified of getting to the end of your life and having regrets, and you’re brave enough to face that fear and do something to prevent it from happening.

You’re terrified of being average. You’re terrified of not being good enough. You’re here addressing that fear, learning, taking action, working on yourself. You’ve run from average and run towards something greater; you’ve sought out other people who want to be better too.

I know when you’re so acutely aware of all your flaws, all your insecurities, all the reasons you aren’t good enough, it’s very easy to feel like you don’t belong.

It’s very easy to feel like you’re an imposter.

It’s very easy to feel like other people are better than you, that you’re on your own, that they’re all in a club together and you’re an outsider. That you’re not the cool kid and you can never be with the other cool kids.

But that isn’t the case. We all felt like losers at the start.

I felt like the world’s biggest loser, for YEARS I felt like I didn’t belong and shouldn’t be here.

But even with all my insecurities, fears and doubts, I still made it. Even me, the loser called Andy was able to make it, despite never believing he deserved to.

The first is to make small snippets of records giving yourself instructions. Then embeds these into a music app. Not sure if Spotify allows it but iTunes did back in the days. Instruction - music - instruction - music. It worked great. 

The second is to put labels on where items should be. I’m assuming your home is a mess here. I got a cheap labeling machine and put labels like pillow, toothbrush, forks etc. it helped offload my sunken brain. 

The third is to reduce the amount of items you own or have visible. In my kitchen I have 1 fork and 1 knife. This prevents buildup of dishes!

I want to unalive myself. But if I talk to the people who should help me I would be either ignored, say I’m manipulating them, or just do a quick it’s ok. I’m not ok I’ve been wanting to do this for YEARS ever since I was in third grade. And I’m just at my breaking point I can’t keep going.

"I am sorry that you are in so much pain and have experienced this for so long. I wish I could offer some sort of comfort to you but I think sometimes pain is fierce and others, at least those of us without training, can't offer the specific comfort/outlet that a person needs at that moment.

Bro I have had these thoughts for a long time and keep thinking that it’s the only way to satisfy. I can’t say what has helped or made me not think of it, but waking up each day and having the chance to make something better is what I’ve focused on. I am accepting that no one cares about you as much as YOU should for YOU. I am still learning how to do that and are leaning less on others. HOWEVER, if someone offers to help you, be sure to listen and just take the help. It may be far and few between, but accept the help and love that people are sharing with you already. Believe me you, I know the struggle and it often seems like the only way. However I assure you it is not. Much love!

"I’ve had suicidal thoughts since I was 15 or so. For me it’s an emotional vent, it’s like I have a back door to my life. It gives me a bit of agency.

"I (27M) had to stop taking my medication about a month ago, I was on anri depressants and a mood stabilizer. I don't qualify for health insurance in my state, I can't get insurance through my job because I'm a temp and I can't get any through the temp agency. In my ignorance I thought as long as I had a script I could get refills but I ran out. 

I loath going into work. I make enough to get buy but I have no real benefits other than a pay check. I don't get insurance, PTO and this company is closing so there's no chance I'll be hired on. I have 2-3 people hounding me everyday either through email or actually interrupting me while I'm working. They ask for parts I'm inspecting, I tell them they'll be next on my list. Another person asks me the same the, the first person then emails me asking for them attaching everyone. I not only have to listen to them argue with me if I reject a part because it doesn't meet the specifications but I have to smell the coworker I actually work with. He smells like he doesn't wipe his ass and it stinks up the room. People have brought it up to HR and nothing has been done about it.

I've been here 8 months going on 9. I walked in Wednesday morning to emails asking for the same things from the same person who'll ask if they're done. I had a bit of a fit and threw something, almost spaced the metal fan by my desk but decided to punch and kick it. I left 30 mins into my shift, I just told the supervisor I was leaving early.

I don't know if I can do it, besides the morning fit I had about a full day of punching myself in the head, legs, stabbed my wall and my cutting board because I couldn't find my headphones. I feel like I'm slipping away mentally and I can't speak to my old doctors because of the no health insurance.

I'm surprised I'm not really depressed pr suicidal just frustrated and irritable. Even dropping something I usually blurt out ""Oh you stupid fucking cunt, God damn piece of fucking shit won't God damn stay where I fucking put it"".  

I don't make a lot at this job so I don't have a lot of money saved but I look daily for a new job because the temp agency is unresponsive ( they will show up unannounced to the building, ask how I'm doing and leave) I have never met them, my original temp agent left the company and I've had about 3-4 since.

I'm at a loss. I sometimes I want to cry out of frustration but I can't, I just sob with no tears or scream into my bed."	DreamPoliceChief	post	24.900320094371434	female	White	0.9994826316833496	na	na	na	3	malementalhealth

"I am a 17 year old 171 cm male, I want to give up on life but am too much of coward to actually commit suicide. My face(especially my forehead) is full of blackheads and scars,I am a loser and loner, I always see people having so many people dming them and I can't help but to become jealous of them even though I have 2-4 amazing people that I can call my friends. I feel like a disappointment to my family, my eldest sister used to call me worthless, useless and a failure, I can remember clearly how my mom said that I should've never been born 4 times. My family also calls me dumb and an idiot stating that I lack common sense (although I think this is turning around slowly)
My ""friends""(not the people I mentioned earlier as being my friends) make fun of me because of me being single and having no sexual interactions yet bringing my self-esteem down even more.In addition, I have been struggling with this red pill bullshit and now feel that I can't trust a woman (except my other sister) to top it all of, I have been struggling with my sexuality of being a heterosexual male as I imagine myself having a very intimate 'friends-with-benefit' relationship with another male and even wanting a loving relation with another male which I think kind of stems from me not trusting woman because of all this red pill crap but even if I'm not heterosexual then I will accept it even thought it really does amp up the confusion I'm facing these past few years.

I do workout a lot and have a pretty decent chest and abs but I feel like these are not enough to save myself from my sadness/depression or whatever the fuck this state of mind I am in right now.

"This is a lot! #42 is especially interesting.  

Some of these are mental health related but some may not be, like friction with your friends and family and spending on clothes. Also some of these are subjective observations from you and some are states or feelings felt by her.  

I’d say that all you can do is support her.  But you cannot “fix” her and it’s not your place to.

"I’m 16 years old and throughout all my life, I’ve always wanted to fit in. I moved from a Spanish speaking country to USA and ever since then my life has been different. When I first came I was lonely with no friends and stuck to my ps4. (Ps. This was my fourth grade summer going into 5th grade) During this time I  gained a substantial amount of weight that made some of my body skin begin to have stretch marks. Over the next 5 years I only gained weight maxing out at 240 with a height of 5’11. Ever since last year I’ve lost about 30 pounds and I’m up to 6 feet. During my middle school time and even now in high school I was and are extremely self conscious of my body because of the marks that cover most of my upper body only surrounding the inside of my arms and around my stomach area. Recently I’ve also noticed that my hair is thinning at the crown and there is nothing I can do about it. Appearance is the biggest thing in this world and every time I try to better myself something new appears. I feel depressed and always looking at myself at every chance I get whether that is a car mirror, a window my phone, etc. there’s just this constant reminder in my head that I’m a loser that will get made fun off for the next few years because of my hair. My fathers side of the family is known to have depression as both my grand parents (dads parents) killed themselves, my grandma before I was born and my grandpa more recently. I feel like I’m losing my head. I’ve tried talking to my mom, but it hurts talking to someone I love so much knowing that she can’t do anything and my words just cause her pain as she knows there’s nothing she can do to help her son. Every time I look at myself I hate what I see more. I feel like I’ve lived through so much that the rest of my life seems overwhelming and pointless. I wouldn’t say I’m suicidal because I know I won’t be able to do it because the guilt of leaving everything to my family will never make me do it. I just don’t know what to do with myself anymore, I’m my biggest enemy.

"As someone already said, maybe shave your head. I don't even would have thin hair but still prefer it. It doesn't have to suck, it doesn't have to be bad, it doesn't have to be a solution, it can be your choice!
About body weight: again as someone already said you can choose to go to different places. I preferred to do exercises at home, because I felt uncomfortable to do it infront of other people. Buuut if you have the courage to ask someone to help you, which I personally didn't have yet, you probably find someone who's willing to. Which turns everything around... 1. You learn making new contacts 2. You lose weight and have support 3. If you worry like me to look weird by doing so, again in this case you would have support. Just some thoughts.
-> Maybe someone who had the courage to ask or is on the other side, a person who would help if they were asked, can confirm. That would back up my theory. <-
And if that doesn't work for you, as I said, don't worry, just do exercises at home. You can lose a lot of weight by doing so. Just think of that you only have a lack of movement because you stick to your PS4. Then a little awareness on what you eat and I'm sure it will change a lot.
Stretch marks: tbh people don't care as much as we think. I am not only full of stretch marks, I am also full of scars because of an accident and also BPD. Still I got a bunch of friends and I'm not a person who brags with it, but believe me, women don't care. Maybe some do, but they're not the people you want anyway.
Depression: a lot guessing, assuming, probablies, science and what not. You really better speak to a doctor. As you mentioned your family, it can be genetic but it also can be trauma handed down to you or just unfortunate behavior issues. It can be so much more, or also less. Accordingly the help can be very different. Medication or therapy or both or maybe just some little changes in your habits. A doctor is definitely your better choice to find that out. From my experience with depression and BPD this is nothing you want to rely only on an internet community... It's helpful yes but you really want to have professional help, believe me.

"What “**holding frame**” actually means:

Frame is your ability to stay in control of a given situation

The leader is a group is usually the one with the strongest frame

A strong frame means you can keep cool in any situation, which is essential for:

**Business**. Your ability to stand firm when negotiating and your ability to take risks.

*Example*: You are clear with what you want and refuse to settle for less than satisfactory.

**Public speaking**. Being able to captivate & lead others while keeping calm under pressure

*Example*: While giving a speech, protestors begin shouting to try and disrupt you. A strong frame is what allows you to speak over them without getting distracted.

**Relationships**. Holding frame is essential for building trust. A masculine frame is what allows a woman to relax into her femininity

*Example*: The woman you’re on a date with says that she doesn’t date guys below 6’. Rather than get offended, you play along jokingly at what she says rather than taking it to heart. 

**Take-away**
A strong frame built upon the bedrock of truth is the answer to a successful & fulfilling life"	Sospian	follow-up	na	na	na	0.001441066269762814	no	no	strong	na	malementalhealth
"I (19F) kinda fell into the Manosphere rabbit hole about a year ago. A lot of men's rights and toxic and hateful conversations are completely intertwined over there (especially in Twitter). The only man in my life is my dad (love you dad ❤️) and I was very much out of loop about men's problems. I wanted to learn. Learn to be more understanding and sympathetic without being patronizing, to extend my world view, and so on. But that atmosphere just made me hate myself. I felt guilty about it. I thought it meant that I'm the problem. That there's nothing for me to do other than to sit and take the blame.
It's very different here. Just amazing men asking for/offering help and lifting each other up. It's beautiful. You guys should be proud of what you've done here.

It's easy to get sucked into the ""collectivism"" mindset where you start feeling guilty for things you didn't do, so I'm glad you broke out of that and were able to just appreciate the different journeys we may face.

I wish you a great journey on learning to be more understanding and sympathetic, toxicity is everywhere, but remember to never let it rub onto you, you are never guilty for something you've never done, I've let it destroy my mental health before in the past, and I wouldn't want that on anyone else."

I don’t feel that way at all. I know what I have to do but that’s just to survive. I don’t know how to do much else. I’m just now realizing I don’t know anything about me except I will give people the shirt off my back if I feel they need it. I hate drugs and booz but drowned myself in them for most of my life. I’ve been clean for more than five years now. This last year has been the best year of my life and I’m thankful for it. Also sad this is the highlight so far. I feel the future could get better but it probably won’t. Not with that attitude lol

But anyway. I feel stupider than a box of rocks 99% of time. If I do decide to try and help someone I always come across as a ass or at least I feel like one. 

I need the world to live a “good” life. The things I went though have made me so I don’t fit into the world. I feel like I don’t speak the same language as most people. While I’ve had some people really help and care help for the most part has hurt more than anything and the way it helped was making me mad enough to make it on my own for a while before I fell back into shit I can’t get out of alone.

The amount of single dads, divorced fathers, and men who have children and are struggling to take care of their families but do a damned good job is wild!
I get there’s some of the belligerent, alcoholic, chain-smoking, weed obsessed, not active fathers but we’re not talking about them as they don’t constitute as “fathers”

Talking about DADS, FATHERS, the men who are raising their children and sometimes others children to be the best future person this world can have and they’re getting shit on?? Them? I don’t know why the current generation that I’m apart of feels the need to so deliberately hate on men with kids that try their best but my father is amazing, he’s not perfect, we fight sometimes, I don’t agree with everything he says, but damnit he is a DAD.

"A person was seeing demons, spiders, shadow, people and spaceships all while going to the drs and therapist. Along with many other meds for many other issues they gave meds for psychosis.  Obviously right. Right?

Well the whole time. About fifteen years of different drs and therapist. The main therapist however was being paid not only by her patient for the visits but his mother one of his abusers was also giving her thousands a month in donations. Like the paid for therapist the patient told all the other therapist and drs the truth. I said my brother raped me. I said my family abused me. They said ok take this pill. 

After fifteen years of this and plenty of my own mistakes the tole stress has took on my body makes me feel if time is short. Anyway. Last year a good therapist whom quit after 2 months but I’m grateful for had to spell it out for me. She gave me free visits so I could move off family land and out of their sphere of influence. 

Even though I told all the drs truth they didn’t acknowledge it. They downplayed it as good as my family. I didn’t need a pill. Since I’ve left family land and left them. My life while still shit is a million times better. I haven’t had an hallucination in a year or more. I have joy and peace sometimes despite all the shit. And the shit that still coming. My upbringing spilt into my life and it’s all crumbling. I’m alone now but I have my so and one good sibling. I’m grateful for them and I want the best for them. I just feel like I hurt them and I know they hurt they all have ptsd too.

Is everyone this fucked? I feel weak for being bothered by these things. But at the same time I realize the more I crumble my family does to. I’m the best help they have and I’m at my end. I’m just tired. I want to help them or do more for them. I’m not leaving on my own steam and I might have more time left than I feel but my body is telling me it’s running out. I’ve had serious medical issues from stress my whole life and only seen dr about it recently. Seriously anyway. Didn’t have insurance before but I do for now so that good. Just haven’t called to make appointment and I don’t know why. I’m afraid it’s because I’m tired and just want die without breaking promises I won’t blatantly break. But I hurt the ones I love cause I’m fucked but I’m the only help they have because the world doesn’t work as advertised. It’s mostly money but it seems more than that. I’ve threw a lot of money well for me at these issues and no one seems to care even if they acknowledge it’s real.

If your family hurt you in anyway. Or anyone in your life for that matter. If anyone hurts you or touched you in anyway you aren’t comfortable with and makes you feel horrible for living YOU are NOT the problem. Your issues are real. Some stuff can be in our head but sometimes that’s because our reality is so fucked. Cut those people out of your life. Treat yourself like someone you love. Even when no one else will. If you can treat yourself like someone you love long enough despite the shit you can get some peace and joy in life. It’s not always pretty but if you try long enough like really try. You will learn to love yourself and that will bring so much peace. I’m fighting. Not the best but I’m still trying.

"So as the title suggests, I made an account on onlyfans so I could see suggestive pictures of pretty women. I know there is a large stigma around this and I was wondering if making this account classifies me as a looser.

For starters, I have tipped a girl on one of her pictures, but it was 5 USD and I don’t intend on being a simp and paying some stupid amount for custom videos or tipping my whole paycheck.

I know I shouldn’t live my life totally based on what others believe, but I just kinda feel like I have to hide a part of myself as usual (I do other things that where I live is considered “degenerate activities” so I happen to hide that part of myself from the world I live in).

Did you take a second to compare the quality of what this action is giving back to you to the negative feelings that you perceive around this action?


To me, if in moderation and as long as no one is getting hurt, why should I be concerned with the things you may need to feel exhilaration or joy?

Honestly bro, just fight your sexual desires. Yes, waaaaaaay easier said than done. It can work though. I’m doing it. It’s hard asf. But think critically when you read this question: What are you really missing? A few minutes of pleasure? I think the problem with so many of us men is we put sex on a pedestal, like as if it is this amazing thing. As someone who has had sex a decent amount of times in my life and is currently in a months long dry spell, I can tell you that sex does not make you feel better about yourself at all. Furthermore, your sex obsessed brain will lead you to have sex with anyone, and you will regret those decisions. You’re the same person with or without sex. Once you realize the only reason you desire sex so much is because sex has become sensationalized and commodified, you realize that you really aren’t missing  anything special.

My motivation was quite unnaturally low. Woke up yesterday after a nap with the weirdest lightheaded feeling, as if I'd taken a weed edible, but I hadn't. I did feel quite good though. I got up, and had motivation to do things again. The depression was over. Any day god could decide to strike me down again. Life is such fucking bullshit.

The only thing I can guess is that it was some effect of my ssri I started taking again (week 8 or 9) in order to treat the crippling anxiety I suffer without it(yay luck of the draw again).

If an author uses that term in a paper it indicates they are also not listening to those voices in favor of that same ideology and yes, that is a black mark against its credibility in the realm of addressing men's issues.

It's simple the term has been coopted and the meaning has changed. Toxic masculinity is now a buzzword that is used to bash men and our ways of being.  It's not a phrase that supports or represents men's issues. Mental health is a less stigmatized phrase but the use of the word toxic shuts down any useful conversation by labeling a set of behaviors as bad without room for the nuances	afancycatnamedmike	reply	na	na	na	0.9988343119621277	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"You mean ""toxic masculinity"".

It's just a phrase used to communicate a concept. Unfortunately, you cannot always word things the way you would phrase it to people who already agree with you, you have to get down on someone's level. If they're hostile to the term ""toxic masculinity"", find a way to communicate the core point while avoiding calling it ""toxic masculinity"", which isn't really that hard, you've made a reasonable attempt to do that.

People who get upset at having to do this... (and insist on communicating their points in a very specific way) I really struggle to believe they actually want to help men, they seem to really just want to convert them to their political camp. The phrase is dead in the water to most people both due to some overly antagonistic (though often not incorrect) use and misleading negative portrayal, and I think people just have to get over that fact. It's not important that you've lost this particular way of communicating your points - instead of saying ""toxic masculinity"", spell out exactly what you mean. Then you'll give them fewer reasons to reject what you say, and you'll become more rhetorically effective through not just trotting out buzzwords.

It’s affected me my whole life I’ve always been pretty shy but now at 24 I’m a full on coward I can’t step out of my comfort zone I can’t take risks and it’s the main reason why I’m depressed and have never even dated a girl.

"Hey!
Bring about a change in you.
Start interacting with people around you.  Develop your skills for communication and try to open up and get the SHY you out and this will further encourage you to be positive and feel more comfortable and confident with known people and strangers alike.  Wish you good luck!"	point_it_out3040	reply	na	na	na	0.9993294477462769	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"Few thoughts.

Coward isn't really a helpful moniker. Unless it spurns you to results right away, self flagellation is pretty much a dead end strategy. The path forward will have stumbles and falls so the ability to forgive yourself is going to be more effective.

Second, I think you should acknowledge that your lack of confidence is not universal. You go to school. You go to the gym. Some people can talk to girls easily but are scared to step foot in a gym. I know high earners at the top of their game who are anxious to talk to women in any non professional capacity. Understand that everyone is at different levels of confidence in different areas. 

Third, I've noticed you are engaging in a lot of defeatism. It's a maladaptive coping mechanism often designed to reduce anxiety. Instead, reduce anxiety by realizing how unimportant it is impress a woman. How unmeaningful it is if they judge you harshly. Women are not a monolith; one's opinion is no reflection on how another might view you. There's also no shortage of them if one finds you wanting. Nothing particularly important is on the line when you talk to a woman. Your main job is to put yourself out there; Let her be the judge. 

I think you should try practicing mindfulness. The next time you are in a moment where you want to run away try to stop and take time to really think about your thoughts and feelings in that moment. Why exactly are you nervous, why exactly did you feel the need to escape?  Why is this interaction important enough to you to cause feelings of extreme anxiety? Is there some past event that you are reminded of, what images race through your mind? The goal would be to discover a clue as to the real cause of your anxiety. 

Lastly, you could try exposure therapy. Understand that a huge amount of men feel some amount of anxiety when speaking to women. You may not be able to 'fix' your problem entirely, but you may be able to reduce it to manageable levels. Exposure therapy would have you expose yourself to interactions with women repeatedly to train your brain that the world won't explode. You can start as basic as asking a women who works at the grocery store where the milk is. Do a how's that weather with the teller at checkout. Find a place online you can chat with women where you can disengage easily and engage without risk. Hop on dating apps with *no intention* of dating. Just text girls you match with. Later, go on dates with *no intention* of seeing her again and no expectations. Like working out at the gym, you can't go to the high weight right away. You gotta expose the muscle to work regularly, and work your way up to higher weight."	point_it_out3040	reply	na	na	na	0.9993294477462769	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
I’d say try to be more social at places like the gym, grocery store, or your job then. Just casually start to chat more to get comfortable with it.

4. It can be very hard to change these kinds of broken situations. I bet the more jacked you get the more aggressive they will become. If the situation doesn't seem tenable then I suggest changing your thinking: Think of them as a natural phenomenon like a storm. You wouldn't waste any emotional energy considering a storm's feelings or trying to sway the outcome of the storm with words. Instead, make plans to get in out of the rain.

"I have been so happy. I was out today with friends, I was way too happy and out of character (i am usually very introverted and dont talk much).
The thing that scares me the most is that first I am realizing how mentally unstable I am. Going from suicidal to aggressive to an extreme level of happiness in a matter of hours/days (literally just a week ago I was scratching my arms so bad it started bleeding and i have scars…)
And also I am scared about the fact that my delusions are cementing even more in my every day life, that my beliefs are always there, even when I am ok. 
While I was out today my mind was always thinking about how they aren’t actually real ecc (im tired right now so its hard to write if you want to get some insight on what I think when I have episodes just look at my profile I use it as a diary). I am scared that I am developing early signs of some sort of schizophrenia and that is not only when I have episodes but its also in a normal state of mind. I am scared about what would happen if i get diagnosed, how things would change. Scared about how my parents would react to it, they already have many problems and I dont want to cause some more.

"Time to seek help man. I don't know shit and I only have what you wrote to go on, but given how you describe it your episodes of mania followed up episodes of depression, the lines of reality blurring, about your exhaustion, your self harm.. it really does sound like something you need to address. Hugely speculatively, I can see some elements of things like Bipolar, BPD, and schizophrenia in what you describe.. but it could be literally anything. It could be something simple like a thyroid or extreme nutritional deficiency or a sleep disorder.

The only way to lose is to not seek help. Here's the game theory:

1. Don't need help, Seek help: You are fine.
2. Don't need help, Don't seek help: You are fine.
3. Need help, Seek help: Can fix or manage problem.

about to go to the fair with the girl im talking to. i have erectile dysfunction and low libido. Fear i have pssd and dont know whats wrong with me. Been one month off prozac and still have problems sexually. Started having ed when hocd came and rocd made it worse. Trans porn fetish caused hocd. Fought my mind for the girl i like. Im over hocd and rocd now but still ed and low libido. Getting off reddit because people say different things on whats going on with me and some say the same thing. Porn addiction, ocd, anxiety, and pssd. Cant find the answer, but my mind is telling me to find out whats wrong with me sexually and to fix it asap. Sorry to the girl that im not perfect and that i started having ed and low libido when you came into my life. Sorry to my parents for letting out anger on you. Harm ocd for 8 months or something. Then hocd and rocd. If my ed and low libido come back after the 90 days i will come back here and tell you guys i made it. If i still have ed and low libido, then its pssd and i will never come back here. I dont know what i will do if i have it. Maybe end it. I wish i can go back in time. Only time will tell what happens to me. Cant believe i might go out like this. Pssd and ocd, cant believe it. To the girl im talking to, I love you."

"I've always been attracted to girls. I was madly in love in my teens but always chased girls that were not interested in me. I lost my virginity at a late age but I had several girlfriends. I never had a long relationship though, because I always felt that I was not with someone I want to be with on the long run. I think that I got very frustrated over this, since my sex drive has been very strong since I was a kid.

Meanwhile I started watching gay porn and experimenting but usually I felt very, very awkward.

I am emotionally attached to girls but I am really scared about relationships and commitments. I don't feel man enough. I am too anxious and I have the idea that I'll never be good enough for someone. I grew up watching porn, isolated, lots of secrets, weird things that any normal person would be freaked out by. Ten years ago I was ready to open up to a girl, share my secrets, spend lots of quality time, do silly things, create little common rituals, travel, have fun, etc. This is the image I had about myself and my identity of a straight man who wants a quality relationship was unshakable.

Now, having been diagnosed with BPD and NPD traits and having experimented I am not sure about anything anymore. I am a different man now because my self image has shattered as I realized things about myself. I'm 30 and I never ever had a proper relationship. Never shared a life with someone. It seems as though I could only be intimate with myself... I'm good at being tender and sensual and caressing girls, but once it becomes serious I always back out. I doubt it has anything to do with my experimenting. I think it's the other way around. I have found finding a partner very hard and have commitment issues, so my brain shut itself off from the emotional pain and I slipped into new territory. This happens in other areas of my life too by the way. I don't have a solid inner vision and faith in myself, I am scared to be who I always wanted to be, so I resort to choices that are not self-identical and I keep finding shortcomings and I give them up and move on to the next thing.

Maybe I'm turning bi, I don't know. The thing is, I am not attracted to most people and there's only few things I'm interested in with my own sex, but I am still way more attracted to girls. But I'm feeling less of a man now and I am more scared than I used to be to ask them out because I don't know what I'd do afterwards. Also, I don't think anybody who wants a serious relationshop likes bi people, myself included. I actually cannot identify with what turns me on and it's weird looking my longtime friends in the eye knowing that my identity is shifting and that they have no idea what's happening to me. I actually hate this. I deviated from the road of having a healthy relationship with kids and family. I still want it but I am drifting farther and farther from it. I think being a reliable partner takes a solid identity because that's what gives you self-assurance. I don't have that anymore. I don't feel like a man and I frequently fantasize about suicide."

"You have a lot biphobia internalized.

Plenty of people have relationships, monogamous relationships, with bi people.

"I'm much younger than you but as someone who went through a similar issue with sexuality, I'd like to throw out my two cents. I was a closeted bisexual for most of my life and I internalised a lot of homophobia/biphobia for a big portion of my childhood because my family was unaccepting of homosexuality. Only recently did I finally come out about it to a couple people in my personal life (not my family).

That being said, you're no less of a man because of sexuality. Most of the people I've met, including straight adults who are married and have children, have shown some form of sexual attraction to the same sex one way or another. There are men out there who are the ""manliest"" of men and are gay. Manliness and sexuality aren't tied in any way, anyone who tells you otherwise is spouting bull. If it helps any, think of sexuality more as a spectrum than anything. Some people will be 75% attracted to women, 25% men. Others are a split 50/50. 

You're more than your sexuality, or whatever porn you watch. Every person is far more complex than just being labeled as gay, straight, or bisexual. You have emotions, memories, experiences, opinions, and many other things that make you who you are, and that is what is important. If you're having suicidal thoughts because of your confusion, please seek help. Talk to a friend that you feel the most connected to, talk to a therapist, anything. You're more valuable than your sexual preferences and you will reach your wants for a family and children. I know that as a stranger on the internet my words are probably little comfort, but know that there are people who care about you and want the best for you.

"Breathe. It can be scary to not have a concrete sense of self after something you come across challenges your old sense of self. But you are not your job. You are not your pornography. You are not your relationships. Sexuality is complicated. Sexuality is different than sex, is different than how you present your gender, is different than whom you choose to date, etc. And these things change. 

Life is change. Embrace it. 

This is scary, but this is an opportunity to develop and learn about who you are and where you want to be. What a gift! It may not be what you expected, but it worth learning about.

"I originally titled this post as ""I don't feel like a man"", but that comes across as a gender identity issue which isn't the case at all; I very much identify as male.

The issue I'm having is that my mental image of myself is categorically different to how others perceive me.

Last night I was talking to my girlfriend and we somehow got on to the topic of attraction from a psychological/evolutionarily perspective, and she said the that some of the things that she found attractive in me are my masculinity/manliness, strong jawline, beard, tall, etc.

I'm 35, 6ft 2"", broad, bearded, dad bod but muscular, kinda like a typical looking lumberjack ... none of this is reality in my mind.

I feel more like a 13 year old boy than a 35 year old man, not very tall, quite petite in build but also fat, quite effeminate....

When I see a photograph or a video that has my whole person in the shot, I feel like ""there's no way in hell that's me... I look slim, forearm muscles/veins are popping, tall as fuck... its too manly to be me.""

It just doesn't register in my brain and its almost like experiencing cognitive dissonance.

"The brain you had as a child is still there, it didn’t go anywhere, just grew. I think most of us if not everybody feels that way to some degree. And it’s great because that child aspect of us is where creativity, curiosity, tenderness, and other valuable aspects of us come from.
The search of growing up and maturing is also a natural drive of evolution. You don’t leave the child behind, but you understand you’re not it anymore. The search and struggle of becoming a man is quite healthy. You have to figure out who you are now, into what person you’ve evolved. And how, unlike a child, now you get to choose the kind of person you want to be. In my book that is to be a man, embracing responsibility for what you care in life, the person you want to be, and the everyday actions that turn into a life you choose. 
A bit of an odd suggestion is reading “A man’s search for meaning” (I think that’s it’s name in English lol) by vViktor frankl. It might seem unrelated to your question at first, but it’s not. There are also lots of resources and content where men have explored these questions. (lots of bs as well about how to become a man or what it means, so think critically about what you read)."

"I recently read the book ""*King, Warrior, Magician, Lover- Rediscovering the Archetypes of the Mature Masculine*"" by Robert Moore & Douglas Gillette. I have been tackling this issue myself for sometime and this book provided insightful wisdom on many aspects.

**Brief** **summary**: *The book introduces four key archetypes: the King, the Warrior, the Magician, and the Lover, each representing essential aspects of mature masculinity. These archetypes symbolize different psychological energies that, when integrated, contribute to a well-rounded and balanced expression of manhood.*  
*Through insightful analysis and real-life examples, the authors guide readers on a path of self-discovery, helping them understand and embrace the strengths and potential pitfalls associated with each archetype. They offer practical tools and exercises to foster personal growth and transformation, allowing men to tap into their inner power and wisdom.*  
*""King, Warrior, Magician, Lover"" encourages men to explore their individual journeys towards becoming integrated, purpose-driven, and emotionally healthy individuals. By embracing these archetypal energies, men can cultivate leadership qualities, develop strength and courage, nurture emotional intelligence, and foster authentic connections in their relationships.*

"I had an idea for an organization that is basically coding for men but the premise includes other than coding also teaching anti-sexism and how not to be toxic along it. During this time the field is cringe. It’s hindering progress with all the toxic masculinity bullshit. women get all these programs because men gatekeep. then go on Reddit complaining why there are programs for women but not men. so let’s give them a program. The whole Reddit can come along. The problem is autistic cishet white men end up being excluded due to ableism but they don’t understand this. they think they need to be cruising along ez. So get toxic when all around them left discourse claims they are most privileged. then we get people like Alek Minassian and other incel killers who all had autism. Autistics gravitate to gaming, programming, math, computer science (branch of math), internet tech. It’s autistic human inventions. 
So things like talking about artificial womb development so people with a uterus don’t have to go through the violence of childbirth they can die from (ectogenesis). developing menstrual products dispensers so that they can be provided in all bathrooms free like toilet paper to fix the male-default bias from patriarchy. Fixing that Discord doesn’t register high pitched voices as well from data being based on lower pitches from male-default bias of patriarchy.

"Most SI gurus tell you that anger makes you work 10 times harder.

That it’s the “fuel” that makes you productive.

***\*sigh\**** They’re WRONG!

It’s just another lie for easy money.

Not because 

But it’s relatable to most people.

I believe you now understand that not every casual thing is actually good.

If you stick with me till the end…

I’ll give you a piece of advice that can be used in any given situation.

Something rarely told in this world.

I easily learned it through experience and by having a conversation with a millionaire.

He 100% agreed with me.

A way to x5 your outcomes and mental strength, which I wish I knew sooner.

## When one is acting emotionally He CANNOT make rational or valuable decisions.

Sure, it’s always better to be angry than soft in this society.

It’s fuel for your gym session, workplace, or even to get rid of complacency.

It gives you the energy and courage to do something that you can't dare to do, 

But I completely disagree with that retarded mindset.

The wise man works at full capacity despite feeling any emotion.

And 95% of the time it only wastes your energy and makes it

Recently, I got badly smashed in the face in a sparring match.

I was so angry at being humiliated this way.

“Next time we fight, I’ll kill him!”

I maybe added a few hours working out driven by anger…

But the rest of the day, my thoughts were unclear and dragging me down.

I couldn’t work on my side hustle or write my newsletters properly.

Whereas all I had to do was ask myself, “Why am I mad?”

* Why did you lose that fight? Even If you worked hard.
* What made your girl dump you? Even if I did everything right
* What got me into X situation?

Most of the time, we already know the answer.

In fact, it is much easier to be stoic.

We have been raised in a way that keeps us emotional for no reason.

That’s when that successful guy came to me and said,

**If you already know what to do, why would you feel any emotion?**

Simply ask yourself this question every time you face your emotions.

While the majority act depending on their emotions.

You’ll perceive life as a chess board, a psychological game.

Gurus will only give their best when they’re angry,

Yet you’ll be ahead of them since you already do that without feeling any emotion."	Waeladvice	post	18.055374717482923	male	White	0.9978785514831543	na	na	na	2	malementalhealth
"Emotions are great, even the negative ones.

Sadness allows us to grieve.

Anger allows us to identify when we are being mistreated.

Anxiety and fear shows us where we can step outside of our comfort zones.

Guilt and shame tell us when we've betrayed ourselves.

Numbness closes us off to joy, wonder, awe, curiosity, and most importantly, **love**.

"I have a challenge that I would appreciate some input on.

Over the years, I have managed to work my way through and overcome most of the fallout from a suicidal depression that characterized my teens.

Those problems were partially caused by me having been sexually molested by an older girl (referred to as 'A'), from my extended family.
Something which took place during my kindergarten years, while she was in her early teens.

I have since recovered from mental illness. No longer thinking of myself as lesser than other people, or inept by default. And I have not had any ideas of ending my life, for longer than I can remember.

I would like to think that I have forgiven my former abuser and moved on. I very rarely think of what happened.

Even though she is still in my social circle, she is way off in the periphery. Where I only meet her once in every 3-4 years. And thats fine by me.
I dont lose sleep over it. I dont wish her any ill will. But this is not a person I want to interact with on any regular basis.

I have my birthday party coming next week. And my mother suggested today that she would invite this person.
My mother is friends with A.
My mother does not know, and I would prefer to keep it that way. Since the reveal would not help me at this point. It would instead harm my mother, who has only recently stopped guilt tripping herself over my previous depression.

My closest friend will show up. He knows, but will keep quiet.

I have told my significant other about some of my past. She is aware that A is still part of my social circle, but has not been given any names. 
My S.O. is very observant though. I dont put it past her to draw some kind of conclusion, even though I have a good poker face. And even though this is her first time meeting A.

My concern is:
 whether I should keep this detail to myself, and risk having a foul mood around my partner? Along with lying when she asks what the matter is.
 Or to acknowledge that it was A. And put her in the predicament of a rather uncomfortable first encounter with A?"	CapedRaccoon	post	30.969582506365512	female	White	0.014661622233688831	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth

She will not care about an uncomfortable first impression when meeting A if she knows this history. If anything she might be frustrated if you dont tell her and let her act all friendly to someone she likely wants absolutely nothing to do with once she finds out.

I don’t really get why A has to be there and I hope one day you can tell your mother because you deserve to never have to see this person again if that’s what you want. don’t let other people’s emotions be more important than your own.

"I’ve been doing really well. I recently accepted a new job etc etc but there’s one issue. My anxiety is SO bad I cannot live. I was invited out today. I’m sitting in the parking lot of this bar that I was invited to. My legs are literally glued to the floor of my car because I feel like my outfit is goofy. So, I’ve been dealing with suicidal thoughts and agoraphobia (diagnosed) since Kindergargen. I remember the first time I told someone very well. 

I am an adult—and I can’t even get out of the car because I don’t feel I am dressed properly. I’m tired of being trapped in my room & in my head. 

I could use some motivation to just get up and go in here. My co workers are waiting and I don’t want to make tonight all about me. I’m just sitting here—in the parking lot damn near about to cry and shaking. I don’t even know WHY other than, well, I don’t like my outfit anymore because I feel I’m out of dress.

My doctor recently started me on an anti depressant for my sleep apnea (and the associated anxiety and depression). It’s in the very early stages, but I’m feeling good! Don’t be afraid to consider medication like an anti depressant (escitalopram is what I’m on) or anti anxiety meds (think Ativan) though my doctor said anti anxiety meds were a last resort for me since they can be addictive. Talk to your doctor or go to a walk in clinic. I’m hoping to get the real me back sometime soon. It sounds like you just need a tune up with a smart doctor to let the real you resurface and let the anxiety go. Best of luck friend, don’t give up!

"Dear Friend,

May I call you friend. I once felt the fear you described and guess what I ended up doing. I chose to go home that night and even beat myself up over it. Here is the truth, it wasn't your clothes that you had the issue with. I'm not going to tell you what you were facing but I will tell you what I faced.

I faced the fear of rejection and that fear caused me to not have a good time. I often try to sell myself to others to get them to ""like"" me. Well until recently when I started down the road to recovery through a program at my church. Recovery has been so beneficial for almost a year I have been evaluating myself and you know what revealed to me? I was resentful. 

Now to bring it around. The program showed me two things. 1. I was hidden and 2. I was resentful. Hidden + Resentfulness = Isolation. Not exactly a health place to be. Now let me tell you why I chose to go down this path. I am no longer hidden. I choose to see both the joy and the pain. I choose to let the people who want to get into the mud with me and those who want to be in the clouds with me. Does that mean I will be rejected? Yes, but it will also reveal the true friends also. I am happy now because I no longer look at the clothes that I wear, but I look at the joy in my heart from not being hidden anymore. That would be my advice for you as well. Let the people see you."

That depends. What's your attitude towards people who look or act or live differently than you do? If you're intolerant of others, I suspect that your biases will keep you in whatever box you're in now, and the box will only grow smaller as you get older. If you're open minded and respectful of how other people choose to live? Then change is definitely possible. Because you can learn from other people. You can try things you wouldn't have tried on your own, have experiences you wouldn't have had on your own. I'm just over 30 myself and I feel like I'm expanding myself and my social circle more than I ever thought possible.

"There's a little bit of truth to this, but it's not as deterministic as you're concerned about.

It is easier to change who you are when you're younger. You've had less practice being one person. Once you've been the same person for a decade or more, you're going to be that person pretty consistently. You likely became that person because at least some things about it worked, and so you've reinforced that personality. It's become a wheel rut that you keep falling into.

It's not that it's impossible to change, but it takes a lot more effort to steer out of that rut, compared to when you were younger and the ruts were still forming. As a result it takes discipline to make the work doable, and purpose to make the change worthwhile. 

If you're asking about a family member, what reasons might they have to change? You can save yourself a lot of heartache considering things from that angle. If they don't have a good reason to change, then at least for the foreseeable future they won't.

If you're asking for yourself, get started with what you want to change and why. Consider whether it will be important for the short term, long term or both. Think about how that person would act, what beliefs they would hold, etc. Then try to break that down into habits and behaviors you can practice. Doing this with a therapist or coach can also help."

"Hi, I was in a thing recently with a girl around at my university. We went on a few dates and kissed but it didn't get much further than that.  She ended things in a pretty disrespectful way and while I was able to forgive that because even good people can make mistakes when it comes to ending things, she did some things after that showed me that she really wasn't the person I thought she was and not the type of person I'd want to associate with again. 

The problem though is that she is really really good looking. Like even before anything happened between us, she was easily one of the best looking girls at my uni. And it's extremely rare for me to find someone I find consistently attractive like I found her. I don't mean this in a simpy way or that I'm putting her on a pedestal as it never changed the way I interacted with her. It's just that even though my mind is over her personality, my brain is finding it really hard to let go of her looks. I just really wish that as soon as I saw her bad personality, I could stop seeing her as physically attractive too. It  makes it harder to just forget about her and move on when she is so much more attractive than the other girls I see around. Like when I imagine her being less attractive, I stop caring at all and it's so easy to just move on. I just wish my brain wasn't so impressed by something so superficial. I just hate the male brain sometimes. Does anyone have any advice on this? Like how can I be less impressed by her beauty?"

I don‘t know where to fucking begin, my brother is terrible to me, constantly belittling me, assaulting me on a few occasions, among other things. He does this to my little brother as well, and I am stuck protecting him.

My parents do nothing except „talk to him“ which works for about a week until they are convinced he got better, where the cycle continues. This has been going on for roughly 2 years now and I‘m going to fucking snap.

EVERYBODY tries. It's fundamental to be a living organism. When it's someone you give a fuck about, you naturally empathize with their struggle. With a man or any group people don't like it's generally the opposite. They must be doing something wrong or bad to deserve it. We aren't allowed to be human and make human errors as we all do. Never are their criticisms productive. It's just a frail excuse to shit on us like they were inclined to from the start. You see it a lot here. Gaslighting pieces of shit can fuck off and get cancer.

Also when you need anything that means they'll have to be selfless to provide, they turn on you and shame you for the consequences of not having what you need (like claiming they'll help and support you but you have chronic pain and other issues so we need medicine or other treatment that you can't afford yourself and you can't work let alone manage your current responsibilities/duties now due to your ailments but they refuse to help you get that treatment so you're still unwell, in pain, and struggling yet they continue to shame you for that and not having a job because of the ailments when if you had treatment and improved wellbeing, you'd be employed)	Aseradeeznuts	reply	na	na	na	0.9989181756973267	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
I'm curious to see who here I started therapy? Was it something that was helpful to you? I've just started and I don't need to pay money to have a conversation with somebody. Did they give you tools to be able to help with your problems? Or was it just a big venting session? How long does it take? Does it actually work.

"My story is long, but I'll condense this as much as possible.

Graduated in 2012 at 17, turned 18 that summer. Never had any chance of going to college since both my parents were put on disability since I was in elementary. By 2013 I joined the navy since there was 0 chance of finding ANY job that would pay more than 7.50 an hr, plus back then thats when getting paid $15 an hr was still just a pipe dream. Never was able to get my license while in the navy due to always moving around, and always being busy +not being allowed to even work on that until after work...when the dmv was closed. Eventually got out at the end of 2017/beginning of 2018. I was 23.

I spent the next couple years working at a bank, what I managed to save up was siphoned away due to my parent shit hole landlords forcing me on the lease even though when you 1st get out...you're under orders to go back home and wait for your belongings. They evicted my parents because they weren't able to move out in time, and ended up owing 1 month of rent...which I was helping pay off on top of their newly raised rent of $1000 a month. They simply kept adding extra fees because it was never paid in full. I eventually left my job to go back to school, and after 1 semester went back to work to lower my debt. By this time it was April of 2020....my new job lasted until august. I had even bought my 1st car due to necessity, only for that to disappear due to covid.

Got evicted thanks to covid BEFORE the eviction memorandum was even expired...somehow (december 2020). I was only 25 at this point. Fast forward to summer 2021 and I find myself in a shit hole apartment but at least housed and working (now 26). Then the landlords decided to kick out all the veterans they took on in partnership with the VA and salvation army. Thankfully I somehow made it out of that situation, moving in with my parents for 2 months before a new apartment was ready to be moved into.

I was working at the VA at this point, until feb of 2022 because I had missed too many days due to finally catching covid myself. (now 27 turning 28) Wound up working some shitty remote job several months later answering phones, just to get fired because using the bathroom for 5 mintutes somehow broke their company policies. Along with more bs claims such as being late....when it their systems having issues.

Now here I am, still unemployed. I spent a year straight looking for jobs, but never actually landing anything. I figured its because so far I lost my dealership job in 2020 due to covid layoffs. Then let go after getting sick, only to be fired from the next job I took on due to needing any job at all. At this point my only real hope is to go back to school in a couple months, but holy fuck I genuinely dont know how to make myself feel any better at this point.

Im barely eating unknown to my parents, I have zero interests in any of my old hobbies, and at this point waking up in the morning is just disappointing. I dont want to be dead per se....but Im not happy waking up either. Im now 28 going on 29, and I've spent my entire 20's working, just to have all of my progress negated and taken away due to shit I have absolutely no control over. how in the fuck am I supposed to stay confident enough to continue moving forward?? I already dont have anyone in my life who can help me in any sort of way, all I have are 2 disabled and aging parents.

Mentally I was kinda able to keep it together, but with each passing year I hate my life, myself, and everything about whats happened so far to the point I can barely even get myself out of bed now. As I write this I havent actually eating in a few days, and sadly I dont feel hungry at only 127 lbs.

For more clarification im not recieving unemployment because the remote job said i broke company policy by ""being late"" when I couldnt clock in anyway due to their systems being broken, and using the bathroom too frequently...I went for 5 minutes twice in a 2 week period. So all I get is my own disability through the va, which is a whopping $190 a month. The only reason im not homeless is due to section 8.

Please just tell me something, anything at all that can help with anything at all. Please."	AdamJensen009-1	post	21.768999810884257	female	White	0.993043065071106	na	na	na	3	malementalhealth

"So I'm done.

I don't know when exactly this happened, or exactly when I made this decision, but I've known for a good while now it's what I want to do without any doubt.

I'm disabled, worthless, unable to be loved and this world watches as my disability has lefte unable to work and feed myself. Laughing while I starve alone in my home with no power. It does not care if I die, nobody does, so why should I?

I haven't been good enough for my family, or my partner. I haven't been good enough for any friends I've ever had, each of which has left without fail time and time again.

As a result today is the day I end my life. I planned to have one last meal and do it, but with no food I'm not even allowed that luxury, so instead I'm off in to the woods near here and hanging myself in the next few hours with a long cable I've found hidden away in my drawers.

I want anyone that reads this afterwards to know that it's blissful knowing there is a way out, and that I'm truly at peace and happy with this decision and it's the correct one for me. Don't think I made this decision out of desperation, I didn't, it's truly the best option for me and I'm happy doing so the way this world currently is.

I also want to say goodbye to my partner, Raven, and to say I'm truly sorry to you and you alone for this. I love you more than anything but I can no longer go on the way things are without my boy, and alone constantly unless you're here with me. You made me so happy in so many ways, you're truly the only bright spark I had left and I love you so fucking much

Work on ways to drown her out in your mind, take care of yourself.  Focus on activities or other enjoyable things that don't necessarily require a third party for approval, just people enjoying each other or an activity you do on your own.  You can do it you have to use your will power.

"I absolutely love my dad, he’s an example to me and worked his ass off to help me get a head start in life, and I’M NOT SAYING this is the sole reason for my issues. 

My whole life I was taught not to be a nuisance, and he very strongly reacted to anything that he would deem “wrong”, from someone slow in traffic to a baby speaking a bit louder in a mall, to anybody in the house taking a bit longer to get dressed before leaving the house. I struggle with anxiety and depression, and always think twice, thrice, before doing ANYTHING.

I lack confidence for even minor things like cycling in the most cyclist friendly city in the world and this lack of confidence is affecting my work (in which I receive regularly good technical feedback, but receive implied feedback about my attitude and lack of energy- I interpret it being implied instead of explicit because I’m “nice” with everyone and always mediate/accommodate colleagues) and I afraid it might even hurt my relationship in the future.

"Therapy taught me that it is action that leads to positive moods, it can be hard but keep doing things you enjoy. There are days I feel I cannot do anything I need to, but by building a daily routine and building in actions I enjoy, it got easier over time. The routine part especially, gotta do it even if your mind is screaming to just sit and stay.

As for the confidence and sorta baggage from your upbringing... Something that helps me is trying to be truly objective about what my father (or parents) did when I was being raised, why they acted in the way they did. They weren't perfect and my father, while he worked to support us all, was not the best male role model. It took me years to realize that in order to be myself, I had to accept that some of the lessons he gave me growing up were antiquated, wrong, or for the convenience of getting kids to chill out because he was too tired to actually parent.

"I'll chime in here as coach who has spoken to OP specifically and, god-willing, hope I answered some questions & provided information that will help him on his journey.

One thing I will say is that there are genuinely mentors out there who have knowledge & experience that **can** change lives. I say ""can"" specifically because it requires work on both ends. 

I struggled immensely myself growing up and was fortune enough to overcome a hell of a lot of issues.

For me I truly believe it's my purpose to help as many men as possible and have a lot of knowledge in lesser-known areas that could seriously make a difference, e.g. hormone optimisation, the Jungian concept of the shadow, psychosomatics, etc. 

One thing I will say is to pay attention to is transparency. I do genuinely believe that there are a lot of coaches out there who do truly mean the best but may still come off as ""con artists"". 

Ironically, the lack of transparency can be indicative of certain areas they themselves may need to overcome. It took me a long time to ""grow the balls"" to show my face on the internet, largely because I still had issues I had to overcome. 

With that in mind, there will always be individuals who do try to make a quick buck.

My suggestion is as follows: do as much research into people who contact you as possible. 

There are mentors who can without doubt can help you change your life - YouTuber Elliott Hulse did very much the same for me. But **do your absolute best to screen these people as much as possible.**

The disingenuous are not going to be experts at what they claim to be, while genuine coaches will be as transparent as possible.

How to spot a manipulative person? I suspect my friend is trying to manipulate me, doesnt respect my point of view, becomes aggressive when someone is spending money for something that is not useful for him and becomes offensive to change his point of view, I dont feel good around him, sometimes he is nice and everything is good but mostly he sounds toxic. I just suspect that he can use some manipulation techniques, I have a Anxiety, depression and ptsd.

"OK I'm gonna tell you something you're not gonna like, most people are manipulative to a degree. 

Manipulative means telling people things when you have an agenda, meaning you're not giving unbiased opinion based on facts, you are interjecting your personal ideology, and your personal interests into the advice. 

Most people do this to some degree.  Often they don't even realize they're putting their needs before yours in the advice. This is particularly true among women who have a harder time, not letting their own personal feelings, color what they advise other people to do. 

The perfect person to ask advice from someone who just doesn't care and has no investment in what you do. Or the rare person who gives you advice, but then openly tells you they have an agenda, what they want.


From your post, it is apparent that you have already decided this friend is harmful to you. That is what your gut instinct is telling you and you just want confirmation.

Try not to be a trauma sponge for others indiscriminately.

Having you be receptive to their problems is a privilege, one you should grant sparingly and should feel free to revoke. You’ll have to be diplomatic.

"Hello.

Normally i don't write depressing shit about myself but i just can't take it anymore seriously.                     
 I have always been a happy person and had lot of well (Friends) i thought but it all went downhill...

First of all im 18 years old with a child, How you ask? my girl lied about using contraceptives and decided to keep the child and afterwards cheated on me. I love the child to death but thinking he grows up with parents seperated so early and seeing him not much breaks my heart in pieces. I keep trying to hold all that weight and keep going forward to do the best for my child but then i realised my friends hated me and used me for my car and money. So all the childhood friends with good memories just didn't give a f about me. I tried to tell my parents but they didn't take me seriously and just said i need to be a man and be there for my child, All easy said when you've been dealing with depression almost all your life and when you finally build yourself up in position that you're happy... you get shot with multiple arrows at once and fall all the way back down, when this time you have no one to help you. I also lost my job recently due a miscommunication and im in a big financial problem now. I feel like no girls like me or even find me attractive when im literally behaving as myself and still take care of myself.

All my life it's been a journey of dragging myself up and get shot down every... single... time...              
 Say what you want about me that it's partly my fault, because yes it is. But making mistakes is a part of life but honestly i just can't bear the weight anymore.

The message is long but i just need to express myself somewhere.

Sorry if the message is written poorly it's because im Dutch

"Idk if this is helpful.. at all.. but I had one overwhelming thought reading your post so I just want to share it with you:

I'm pretty much 10 years older than you and my life is not ideal, I've been struggling with various things lately. Breakups, depression etc. I still feel like I'm not where I want to be as an adult. And you're 10 years younger than me, with a kid! The one thing I thought is damn, if you manage to fix things up now (even if it's slow and gradual) you are going to be so much more a man/rounded person in 10 years time than I am at my age today. 

Like this is an opportunity to grow and harden, learn from what went wrong. I didn't really have any major difficult things to deal with until recently (moved to a new country, broke up with the girl I came here to be with, lol, etc.) And just now am I realising that these hard times can benefit you, as they encourage you to grow.

Sounds kind of stupid or redundant but you have a lot of shit going on, and you're super young. I would be struggling in your position, I can't imagine myself dealing with these adult problems at age 18. Trust me, if you just accept that not everything is going to be perfect immediately, and that progress is a slow daily thing, you will be proud of the man you'll become in your 20s. Don't think too much about ""mistakes"" other than learn from them and apply what you learned to the future. You can't change the past but you're going to be so much more switched on as you go into your 20s than 99% of guys.

"Yes to it all and thank you for sharing. This does not sound like an easy thing to deal with. 

There are no solutions for feelings. You feel them, even if it’s a crappy feeling. With time and perspective, you learn to understand things change. The people who pissed me off when I was a kid have been replaced with new people who piss me off with more serious issues.

Things change, but never as fast as you want, and often not in the ways you expect. In the meanwhile, remember you are not your strong feelings. 

For me, I try to walk off bad brain chemicals that contribute to my crappy feelings. Sleeping normal hours helps relieve some of the strain.

Maybe our soul is just our psyche which can be derived from the matter that makes us up, ungodly a thought or not. Death is like before birth. What remains of you is your legacy, your deeds and your words and your descendants. 

I think religions are a way of rationalizing the unknown so that to relieve our psyche of the unbearable burden of knowing that we are going to die. To that end there are several myths or stories about what will happen. Personally I don't want to believe in hell or anything that lasts for eternity, because not even the universe does.

If I should pick a story to believe in it would be this: there is reincarnation (because hey, matter is in constant circulation too, why not the soul), which doesn't make it any less easier. However, if your karma is clean enough, your soul gets out of the circulation of the earthly life and goes to a higher sphere, a nicer place that has its own wheel of life. So there's both the eternal wheel and heaven."	CyclePersonal8	reply	na	na	na	0.9981075525283813	no	no	strong	na	malementalhealth
What happens to you after Suicide isn't important as Your story has ended. I can assure you that the true pain begins for everyone who loves you after you die. Suicide often forms clusters of more suicides from the pain of loss that your loved ones experience. We want a way out that is painless, but it just isn't possible because we we all connected to each other, and even if you die painlessly by your own hand, that pain will be visited tenfold upon all those who love you.

"As a Christian and someone who has attempted at life, I believe in an afterlife, I’ve seen and heard far too much to not believe. 
I also believe that if your unsuccessful at ending your life it’s because your mission on earth has yet to be served. We all have a mission that we are on that we know nothing about until it happens, I know myself that my mission is still yet to show itself, I believe that if you are successful you have to answer questions as to why you deserve to go into the afterlife world and to ask for forgiveness of murdering yourself. Are you ready to be reincarnated into yet again another body of any kind and given another mission? 
I just want to lastly say, please don’t do anything to harm yourself, your worth more than taking your life.

A few days now of feeling like absolute trash and having no will to get out of bed. Thinking of self-deletion. I don't know what happened I was feeling pretty positive before this. Not sure of the cause. I take meds, I exercise, I eat healthy, I socialize as much as I possibly can. Perhaps dread of my upcoming new job? I was supposed to start this morning and it's almost 6am so that's not happening anymore lol. Is the damage from my lonely, shitty childhood already done, my brain already screwed up? I don't know. I'll keep being a burden on my mom, failing classes and quitting jobs, until I'm forced to work for some reason for survival, then maybe I'll be motivated to do something.

Well you know getting laid is complex if you are looking to hook up you have to be pretty attractive and it takes time to go from meeting someone to the bedroom generally speaking there is a build up process.  Most guys these days that are single aren't having much sex, just a fact.  Work in improving yourself and recognize it's a process that involves many steps.  You will need to find a way to take care of your sexual tension on your own it's just not this easy thing to go out and find someone who just wants quick sex like you do.  I'd encourage you to work on making yourself more attractive by dressing well, going to the gym, and being social. It's not this easy thing for everyone.  Some guys it is easier primarily because they are just hot and girls are pretty easy to convince when that is the case, other people aren't and it will take a lot more effort.  Just how it is.  Don't put value on if you are or are not having sex it's really a bad thing to fall into.  Lots of success or failure in that realm have to do with things that you don't have direct control over.  Your approach anxiety is rooted in previous experiences with rejection or based on how you think all people will see you and it's something that you will have to place yourself in more uncomfortable situations and practice it to start to break the fear.  Even if you are rejected a lot it will still at least give your mind a chance to understand the process a bit better and work on your confidence. Some guys it's just easier because they look good and they approach with confidence or they get a lot of matches online.  Most guys just won't.  Takes a lot of patience.  But never value yourself on anything having to do with dating or sex or even compare yourself to other people it's just not helpful for you.	sumimigaquatchi	reply	na	na	na	0.9993927478790283	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

Well I've had mixed opinions on how I look and I feel a number of people don't find me attractive and it's been a tough thing for me.  It's tough because in the back of my mind I try to do the whole online dating thing, asking people out and what not, and I have setbacks.  It's a tough thing people put a lot of value in physical attractiveness and it's something I'm trying to improve.  In the back of my mind though I just keep feeling like I'll never get there and I won't look as good as I need to in order to make a relationship finally stick.  I'm in kind of a negative loop with this I go in up and down phases with how I feel about myself.  It's difficult reading people's success stories then you look at them and you just think we'll yeah they look attractive and then it weighs on me.  What thoughts do you have to help me feel better about myself?  I'm working on myself but I'm constantly concerned I won't get there.  I think my fears are rational but it can be pretty damaging to my mental health.  It feels like at times telling a person who is paralyzed that they won't be able to walk.  Like I just start to feel like I'm not attractive enough to get women interested in me and that feeling is really horrible and it's probably not completely true but i feel the feedback I get from people it hasn't helped me feel any better.  In therapy they kind of brushed it aside never really got an answer on how to deal with it.  For all I know I might be unattractive and it may have been a large contributing factor to why I've never had sex, never been in some kind of long term relationship.  But you can't just fix your face and all of that.  Am I left to cope?  Like my example of the paralyzed person? That brings a lot of sadness.

"Thr best thing you can do is create an appearance that makes *you* happy with yourself. 

If you don't really care about your appearance, you should start to. I don't mean try to create an appearance that will attract women, I mean you should create an appearance that makes you happy to look in the mirror.

I invested in high-quality boots, jeans, belts, and a few jackets. I kept my wardrobe down to about 4 main colors and mostly wear shirts I pick up from when my favorite bands are on tour or merchandise from small artists I really like. (No more clothes from Target with gaudy branding).

The next thing you can do to invest in your appearance is find a good barber with good reviews and a clean shop. They can figure out what kinds of hairstyles work best with your head shape and type of hair. Any barber worth his salt will also offer hot shaves and hot towels (which I feel like is a mini spa-day for myself). If you're not happy with it, wait for it to grow out and try a different style! Or maybe just grow it out if you like having long hair.

And personally, I love getting tattoos. I love flipping through artist's flash folders and getting neat pieces of art. I get compliments on my tats sometimes and they're nice ice-breakers.

"I connect with this. I’m 5’6 and average looking. I have been able to get relationships, but that’s about it. I’ve never been able to be the “hot guy” or be considered “the hookup guy” by women. The only sex I’ve ever had is in relationships and even while in them they’re the only ones that find me attractive at all anyway.

The truth is, yeah I’ve fallen into the “self-improvement” trap throughout my life. For over a decade I’ve put insane amounts of effort and money into my style between getting the right clothing, finding clothes that compliment my body and getting them tailored. I do receive the very occasional comment on my style, but it’s only specific pieces (nice blazer, nice shoes, nice jacket, cool shirt”). I’ve put insane effort and consistency into my grooming, and skincare routines by getting regular haircuts that fit my face shape and despite having good skin still taking care of it. I’ve gone to the gym and work out at least 5 days a week lifting weights but I’ve got very little to show for it. I follow all the guides including diet and I still can’t really gain muscle. It’s basically led me to considering roids because I just don’t have the right genetics. Even so, I’ve never been fat. My personality is fine enough, I can get into relationships and have people stick in them with me, and I’ve even be told I act with confidence and I’m a very easy person to talk to. I have done all the things that should have made me attractive, but it didn’t because no style, no haircut, no skincare routine, no personality can make you grow taller or make your jaw stronger.

The Day before yesterday I got  drunk with some strong booze and I ended up having another of those arguments which resulted in me calling her.

 As usual it was painful and she rejected me and my feelings as usual. I was talking to her  but then something strange happened. My eyes got covered in tears and it blurred my vision. I cried for a bit while being surprised and kinda happy that I was able to do it.

 Idk If she heard it but she disconnected the call as of course nobody wants to hear a grown man cry.  It lightened the weight on my chest a little bit. Idk If I will be able to cry like that anytime soon. I never understood why is crying so hard for me. I want to be able to cry at my problems more.

Being hooked on someone is not a terrible thing, you have to remember you can’t control how you feel or what you’re interested in. So just look at your available options, if you like this girl and she’s not available then a relationship is not on the table for you right now, so the question to ask is what is? Rather than spending your time imagining what she would be like, think about the person you would want to be for your life partner as you have control over that. If you want to be fit and in shape, focus on the gym, if you want to be able to spend loads of money on them focus on work.

"Fucking hormones! So much suffering due to being an animal made of chemicals that are trying to make copies of themselves. 

You have a serious problem and it's not a woman. You don't see yourself as having any value.

Maybe that's just this week, because you're feeling the rejection. Or maybe it's deeper. Either way, you got that message from somewhere, probably as a young child. Someone told you you're not good enough: that you're ugly, you're shy, you're stupid, whatever. Maybe they said it outright, maybe they communicated it through their actions: negligence or abuse from a parent, cruel peers, foolish teacher, etc. 

They're wrong, and they're evil for not caring about a vulnerable child. 

But you can work past it. It's hard. It takes work every day to change your mind. 

Start by imagining the vulnerable child that you were and asking them what they need to feel loved. That's sort of a meditation you can do by yourself instead of therapy. 

What you really need is something to spend your time on that makes you feel good. Powerful. Skilled. Smart. Improving. Something that's special to you, not just some cookie cutter shit like lifting weights that anyone can do. Something like music or programming or building or writing or gardening... something you love. It's fine if it's something stupid like knitting or painting Warhammer figs. But it had to be generative, creative, not just consuming media. (Maybe it generates money, maybe not. Balancing basic survival needs is another challenge we all face.)

You will learn to love yourself through that action. Don't think of it as a hobby. Think of it as *your life*. Use your time to generate love within yourself. If you practice that, it doesn't matter what you look like; you will be attractive. But you also won't care about being attractive, because you'll have what you need within yourself. 

This is the mission of your life. Take it seriously. 

The lens I'm trying to see through in my own life right now is to *achieve* rather than to *soothe*. I honestly spend way too much time just trying to feel OK. But I actually feel better when I don't think about how I feel, when I think about what I can do.

Man I wish I had responded to this earlier. The biological drive argument doesn’t land with me. Yes, that is your drive. But is your point on earth merely to confirm every biological drive like that? Is it not your ability to be more than your biological drives that make you uniquely human? It’s not to repress your biology as much as it is to accept your consciousness as something bigger than your desires. Someone’s depressed because their life becomes about gratifying desires, you tell them there’s more to life than that and they’re antagonistic towards you because you challenge their hedonism. It’s not that I respond to long time virgins with the advice of finding something bigger out of unsolticed advice either. It’s because you have people on this sub literally making suicide posts because they’re not getting pussy and it’s sad. It would be unfortunate to die never making good on the potential you have.

"You are wrong.

First of all- extreme life threatening stress cannot ""erase"" or ""disappear"" mental issues.

But also many people *are* trying to survive. The threat is not an acute one of a tiger in the bushes- its the constant, chronic threat of crippling debt and homelessness and unaffordable medical needs. The stick which employers wave- ""you outta consider yourself lucky to have a job!"" Because without one you will perish.

The answer is because even if they reproduce they will still be depressed and empty, on account of their real problem typically involving a very heavy dosage of self-loathing, and lack of emotional coping skills(which you need to deal with the cold indifference of existence)."

"I don't know who or where I can say this to anymore, but I figured I shouldn't let it pent up anymore.  
I think I've had depression ever since I was a kid, and it just keeps getting worse and worse every single year, but I acted good enough to not let it influence my social life so I have a rather normal life even though it keeps eating me from the inside. So I met this girl 5 years ago in university and we became rather good friends, we share to each other our experiences a lot.  
So last week, I decided I should tell her about my mental state, I asked her beforehand about it because I don't want to trauma dump and she accepted to listen to me. When we talk, I described how I feel all these years and feel actually kinda relieved about being able to actually tell someone who wouldn't brush it off, berate me or ridicule me. Until she hit me with ""I hope you don't want to murder me or something"". Is it because she thought depression equates to psychopathic serial killer behaviors ? Is it because she was being wary of men ? But we've known each other for 5 years and I thought we trusted each other. That sentence somehow shattered my vulnerability and somehow made me want to cry because suddenly I feel animosity from her, but I held it back and try to steer the conversation to other subjects.  


I hadn't talked to her since, I don't know how to deal with my mind anymore, how come a single sentence mess me up this much ? Why am I blowing this out of proportion ? I still love her and I know she did not meant to hurt me, but I just can't shake the feeling of animosity off the back of my head, does she think of me differently now ? What do I do ?

I'd never opened up to anyone before and so it was really difficult for me to put myself out there like that. Anyway, long story short - they both pretty much began to ghost Me directly afterwards and within a couple of months I'd lost them both as friends.

You can reach out to her, but the first thing you need to do is let her know she *hurt* you. Don't apologize for scaring her, let he know that what she said, her possible joke made you feel othered. Put the ball back in here court where it should be. 

As much as you think she thinks differently of you, you NEED to think differently of her until such a time she regains your trust. That's right, she's the one who has to repair the relationship between you both. 

You should tell her how her words hurt you and changed your view of her, letting her know that you just can't trust her and that you hope she understands if you don't open up to her again. It she cares about you, she'll be upset without making it about her. She may have an excuse, an argument, a reason. Let her express it, then ask her why she felt that applied to you. Maybe she'll rethink her action or she'll double down, but at that point that's on her.

As for your mental health and the issues at hand, I don't know if you're seeing a doctor about it, but I would recommend it. Seek help from professionals if you can. Things got better for me when I was medicated. Sure, it wasn't a magical cure, but the emotional fog I was in cleared and I was able to make changes I needed to make to help. (horrible job, long story)

Let them know you've felt this way since childhood, that's an important piece of the puzzle.

"There's a massive stigma around men that have mental health issues. People think of emotionally distressed men in the same way people used to think of gays in the past, as in there's something ""deeply wrong"" with such men. People virtue signal about how they want Men to ""Express Emotions"" but the truth is that they DON'T. Men who are insecure are constantly bullied for having ""Fragile Masculinity"" and Men who are suicidal are told to toughen up and stop being a loser.

Society is not ready to handle Men's Emotions, everyone is so used to men being Stoic that they freak out when they see a man emotionally break down.  Most men wear a mask of stoicism to avoid the public shame of being a WEAK man. It'll take like 40 years before we normalize men being emotional without someone calling you a whiner, loser, incel etc etc  and that's an optimistic estimate.

"I am so sorry for that unnecessary comment made to you for opening up. I wish I were your friend so I could validate your emotions and be a safe space for you as a friend should. I (F) follow this sub because I really, really care for men's mental health; I've observed how neglected it is and it honestly hurts my heart when men open up and are cast aside or made to feel like their emotions are not worth talking about.

I'm always trying to open up to men (using my intuition as a guide on who to open up to) while encouraging them to open up to me, too whenever they need. It's important for ALL people (yes, including YOU!) to have those conversations and have their thoughts heard and validated. It's okay to cry - we're human and it's completely normal to cry after a comment like that. You opened up a part of you that the world rarely ever sees and you were unexpectedly met with unnecessary judgment - whether she truly understands that or not. I always feel like people do not truly understand when making insensitive comments because if they did, they would not make those comments. If they truly understood, it would hurt them to hurt someone else in that way. Not an excuse for her but she has her own healing to do.

Something that helps me when I'm really down or feeling really strong emotions is allowing myself to fully feel the emotions I need to, then reflection (usually journaling). Which then allows those words to be somewhat tangible so you can more easily process them. Last is the next steps you'll take in life after feeling these intense emotions - possibly changes? Usually comes up during the reflection process.

"It’s impossible to know what someone is thinking or feeling without asking them.  That goes both ways.  She may not know how her words made you feel as you also didn’t tell her and you steered the conversation a different direction. 

If you feel it is safe enough to do so, you can ask what she meant or share how you felt when you heard her words.  Maybe it might help to phrase it as, “When I heard you say …, I felt …”.  How they react will give you a bit more information on how what they are thinking and feeling.

That aside, I feel a little sad to read your story and hope that you find the support and empathy that you are seeking.  

From my own personal experience with the people closest to me and I’m the most vulnerable with, I realize that listening, empathy and responding non judgementally are skills that we learn and develop.  Expecting them to be proficient when we share our complex emotional situations hasn’t gone as well as I expected for me.  Many people parrot the responses they encounter in their day to day, social media or TV.  Have you considered your friend may love you and also didn’t know how to respond so she went with humour?  

Often we try to change the subject, mood or focus because we get uncomfortable.  You did it too, it’s natural.  I believe the way forward is to acknowledge the feelings are there and it takes skills and practice to make bad feelings lessen."	sinshock555	reply	na	na	na	0.9917528033256531	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
I know I'm late, but my advice is to just not open up to women. Sometimes they just don't want to be around a guy who they see as unable to get through their own problems. And even if they do, I'd keep in mind the fact that men and women have different experiences and see things differently. I'd recommend talking to a guy about these problems in the future. You get a better idea of how to handle it as a man, and most guys understand how hard these types of things are, making them less likely to leave or say something out of left field.	sinshock555	reply	na	na	na	0.9917528033256531	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"Man do Not listen to these people. Most women will not think less of you for opening up. and I bet this girl doesn’t think less of you, I bet she was just afraid due to past experiences. i aint seen one person acknowledge the validity of this because this sub seems sexist. They want you to believe that women can’t comprehend male pain, that you should never open up to women and never let them in because they’ll just hurt you and blah blah blah. You’ve been friends for 5 years. She’s been there for you and you’ve been there for her. Some miserable fucks on Reddit shoudlnt ruin that for you. Explain that she hurt you, absolutely. Make yourself clear that it was hurtful but give her a CHANCE to apologize man!! 

I’m a guy who has struggled immensely and I’ve had a woman admit to being afraid of me due to mental health and drugs. so yes I know exactly what this feels like but women have a REASON to be afraid of men with mental health issues it’s extremely common for women to have experienced abuse at the hands of a guy who claimed to have “mental health struggles”. It sucks ueah, and you shouldnt let someone be rude to you over it but yeah, now obviously you WONT do that to her but that’s a real fear. By saying this to you she was likely just nervously getting the thought out in the open. Its not a good thing to hear when you’re vulnerable, I know. But all you have to do is communicate.Tell her she hurt you and let each other share your side. let her try to ease your mind and you can ease hers. But do NOT listen to these idiots man"	sinshock555	reply	na	na	na	0.9917528033256531	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
Especially people it really would help to know about. I have some issues that make judging peoples view of me seemingly impossible. I have learned to go off results not feelings but  any tips would be appreciated. Like people can give me all the hits and signs in the world from paying me to hurting me and I’m slow on the draw years even sometimes behind. Makes trusting people and myself hard but finally I found out not impossible all the time.	_Dirty_Deedz_	post	22.32864170148911	female	White	0.0027790104504674673	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth
The people I’ve met who have similar problems to you usually are hyper logical to a point that it makes it hard to for them to read social cues or sub communication. For instance, I could ask you “ how are you ? “ , and could be asking the question with a tonality of discomfort. On the surface it seems like I’m interested in how you’re doing but I could be only asking that question out of a feeling of responsibility or to disarm tension or awkwardness. It’s not going to be easy for you to learn to read things like sub communication, but since you’re probably hyper logical to be having this problem to begin with, when you do understand it you’ll probably understand it more than the average person because you’ll be able to explain them very in depth. In short, learn what social cues/sub-communication are. Read up on it and then exert active effort to find real life examples.	_Dirty_Deedz_	reply	na	na	na	0.0027790104504674673	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"Dating and teaching an inexperienced person must just be a big unenjoyable burden. Imagine being a 20 something girl with a good amount of experience you’ve built up since your teens and dating a similarly aged guy who’s never been in a relationship and doesn’t even know how to kiss or please you in bed, let alone be in a relationship. They’re sloppy and uncomfortable, they make all the mistakes and don’t know how to do all the little things that people stamp out when they are 17. They have no idea how to please you in bed or with a kiss or hug, and you have to painstakingly explain and show them every single little step and detail about how to be in a relationship that you’ve figured out with any number of partners you’ve already had who figured this shit out at an age where it’s acceptable to be awkward. Past a certain age, you’re simply supposed to know what you are doing and to have at least some experience. The vast majority of people are not at all patient or understanding that much to be willing to put up with someone like that, who actually has to put in effort to do something most people learn how to do naturally. Why would any woman ever put themselves through the pain of teaching an inexperienced loser how to be a good partner, when at the swipe of a screen or just a short walk away they can get a good looking charismatic guy who’s perfectly compatible and who’s also experienced? Why settle for anything less? 

With just a little effort, a guy who is infinitely more attractive, charismatic, intelligent, funny, experienced, interesting, and compatible is available for the picking. No need to give the inexperienced autistic virgins a chance and give yourself a headache. I mean, no woman with even the slightest hint of standards or self respect would ever date an autistic man when there are better men just within arms reach. You simply cannot compete."

 In the past two years, i started getting really depressed after a car  accident that was entirely my own fault. I was driving under influence,  and destroyed a car, luckily the accident only involved myself. But  since then i dont feel good at home, im feeling like only a burden to my  parents. Neither at school or work. Finishing my master's thesis felt  empty. I didn't even tould my family that i had finished it, because of  the severe lack of communication between me and my family. I was always a  lonely person but it agravated during covid lockdown when I got  addicted to porn, and still am. I separated from my childhood friends,  because i isolated myself, i never went to a discowith then because i  had no social media and didn't get invites, and the social activities  that i have are just a few around the year ,and i feel like im invited  only by pity, more that anything else, because even during dinner with  friends i barely talk. Only recently did i start using social media, and  actually start having some social progress after therapy. But whats  really boging me right know is getting obsessed with a girl, in a  'oneitis' mindset knowing that she doesn't want anything with me, and is  involved with my married friend. To be honest every time i look at  there's face, i feel angry, but at the same time there are degrading  thoughts on myself. Right know i feel like shit, without nobody to talk  to, or actually the courage to talk to anyone. At home every time i look  to my parents, i only feel gilt and dont talk to then about anything  that is upsetting, at work I can't focus on a simple task because of the  'oneitis' mindset that ruining my productivity, and other changes that  might come with other girls. The only good moment in my day is in the  gym when, my mind kinda shuts off, but as sune as im driving home  everything shows up. The weekends are spent at home just in my room,  another catalyst to isolation. Im also really scared of continuing this  cicle of self isolation, and the consequences that my come from that.  Therapy worked in the beginning, but know i dont feel motivated to even  show up to the psychologist, because there are no progress in the recent  months. Just righting this message felt like a relief, but i really  need help, outside of pills, because right now i don't see a future in  my life.

 I just happened to see this wiki in another men's sub, it might help you with something, it might not, but something compelled me to share it, so here it is:
https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/wiki/sidebar/resources_for_men

If you're not married or have a kid or are going to adopt or are a godfather or will never be called on to take care of your parents or family member or even a pet or if you don't work towards a cause or volunteer or practice a religion or have a passion project or business or even passionate goals, then you need to find what gives you life, or even if you're a Godless, hedonistic, self-centered nihilist, then fuck it just find something that gives you a rush man. I feel like if I flew in a wing suit off one of those mountainsides in Europe I'd find something in me that wanted to go on. If for go other reason than to keep flying, lol.

Maybe look at the things that have changed your life in the past as a guide. Or even what you enjoyed or wanted to do when you were a kid. Be open, he curious. There aren't many kids that I know who are thinking in the back of their mind they will likely kill themselves in 5 or 10 years. They are curious, they are open, they look at the world in wonderment.

I look at myself in the mirror, pictures, or reflections anywhere and I get so down about my appearance. I feel so ugly. So many people tell me I’m not yet I can’t seem to believe them.

"I always hated my appearance, so learning to love it took a lot of time and practice.

Half of it was cognitive behavioral therapy. The other half was self care.

For CBT: Flirt with yourself in the mirror. Give yourself compliments, even if you don't feel like you deserve them. When I wrote a gratitude list, I wrote at least one thing I liked about myself every single day. (No seriously, this works. It takes some time, but it rewires your brain)

For self care: Invest time, money, and energy into your appearance. Pick up a skin care routine. Go to a professional men's barber instead of a Supercuts. Figure out if you look better with no facial hair, trimmed facial hair, or a full beard. Exercise as often as you can. Update your wardrobe and see what kind of jeans look best on you."	fruit_fly_food	reply	na	na	na	0.008285021409392357	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"There’s nothing you can really do unfortunately and that is why being ugly can be one of the worst curses (if you’re appearance is genetic). Plastic surgery is not really a option in my opinion, not at least for men because it’s quite noticeable or it’s just not good and your doctor can also fuck up too, making your situation worse (permanently). You can still try it tho. Gym is also good too but it’s not really gonna make you much more attractive, there’s a difference between looking big and having an attractive face. My best best recommendation for you: Money. Money out powers anything, even an ugly face. If you have an ugly face, and your problem is being invisible to women, then if you have money it will definitely cover up your ugliness, obviously they’re probably not going to love you for who you are, they’re going to love you for your money but it DOES work anyway. Work on yourself instead of worrying about your face 24/7. My other recommendation is to get rid of the urges for love and partner. Try to do it naturally without drugs. Most of us men worry about our appearance only because we’re trying to find a partner or get into a relationship or have sex. So not giving a fuck about love anymore, quitting porn/love and getting red of the desire for love is gonna help you a lot because then why would you care about your appearance? If you’re having social anxiety in public or if people are treating you like you’re not part of the society, gym would help. Boost your testosterone. Even if you’re ugly, but at least fit, people are not really gonna talk shit to your face or ignore or misbehave towards you that much. Being ugly is such a curse, a permanent problem, causing us to miss out one of life’s most pleasant desires and experiences. This life is so fucking unfair, and this so called thing called: God, is a dickhead for allowing such things to us innocent people like that. Unnecessarily sufferings all the time…. :(

So what helped me or it’s gonna help me:

1)Keeping my mind busy to keep those urges for love away

2)Giving up on love

3)Not giving a fuck about what others and society think about me or my appearance

4)Try my best to find a way to get rich"	fruit_fly_food	reply	na	na	na	0.008285021409392357	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"What I’m about to talk about here isn’t me demanding for a relationship, but asking to find a way to find what was taken from said relationship; self worth and self confidence.

Five years ago, I was in a relationship with someone who was very caring of me, very protective of me. I’ll admit, it was the first time I actually loved someone back as she loved me. Anyways, for several months she and I were deeply in love with each other and wanted the best for each other. Now, I would hope this would last a year at least, but it didn’t because of one thing; her little sister.

She didn’t approve of our relationship and would harass and put me down whenever she could. I got angry and said in private with a mutual friend of mine that she was acting like a bitch. I was sensitive to the insults she threw at me and made me vent with a friend. Little did I know was that he would share with the little sister who would then tell my gf, who she protects the most. 

From there, I would be contacted less and less. She would barely talk to me and it would only to ask me questions. Then, another mutual friend of mine told me that during her time of absence from me, my ex decided it be best to talk shit behind my back, screenshot all of my conversations, and create a voice chat dedicated to talk shit about me. By the time I learned about this, she blocked me on everything. I saw screenshots from the chat and it made me want to commit suicide.

Ever since then, I feel like that I don’t have any self worth because the person that once loved me decided to talk shit and put me down behind my back.

Im seeing a therapist and have been working out. I just don’t feel I’ll ever find a girl like her again, someone who accepted me for who I am. I can’t accept myself now because of the bullying, ridicule, and social isolation life put me through.

"No, you are wrong. Being picked at by idiots doesn't make you a loser. It makes you unlucky at social experience but never a loser.

You have to learn to be a lonewolf. Cut off all motherfuckers who pick on you. And only when you feel ready start talking to women.

#You are Not on this Earth to people please and base your Self Worth on how others treat you.

You have to be Proactive and Focus on your Self Improvement, for yourself. For your own Gain. Become the Best Version of yourself. Drop the Insecurity.

What those motherfuckers think of you is entirely their problem. You are the boss of your life and lifestyle.

Here are few tips on Self Esteem:

1. Prioritize Discipline. Discipline kills Insecurity. I wish someone told me that before and now I'm telling you.

2. Gym/Home Gym. Enhances Physical & Mental Health. Go Slow and Consistent. Don't rush, Gym is Journey Not a Destination.

3. Comfort zone is your enemy. It inhibits Growth and causes Depressive state.

4. Focus on the things you are able to control. Like your reactions, your behavior, your discipline, your emotional regulation.

5. Belief - You must believe in yourself even in the Grimmest of Storms on your Journey. You owe it to your Best Version."	point_it_out3040	reply	na	na	na	0.999325156211853	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

Brother, I don't know you, but I do know that what you are describing is learned helplessness. Perhaps you experienced rejection, as we all do, some much more than others. But from a half century of life, I can tell you, I can GUARANTEE you, there are always people that you can develop friendships with, and there is always a woman that can come to like and love you. Focusing on building your life, adding new hobbies and interests, and developing a network of some friends is paramount to you building some self-esteem, then worry about women not before, in my humble opinion. Make friends with an older guy if you can who can give you honest constructive tips to help you in life and with women. Remember, we all feel rejected and beaten up by life sometimes.

I've been there too. I know it feels unlikely, but it does genuinely get better and easier. At some point I decided that I was likely going to be pretty much alone forever and may as well enjoy myself, travel, and do things I enjoyed. It ended up giving me sufficient self-confidence and opportunities to actually meet and attract women, although having been through what I have since, I'd caution against jumping in too soon anyway. You should be able to enjoy your life alone fully, so you are able to see when someone detracts from that or supports it.. It can be very easy to find someone you like, and just close your eyes to too many red flags for your own good, if you've been kicked around a bit by life. Don't worry about proving yourself to idiots who don't understand your value.. go find others that do, in all relationships.	point_it_out3040	reply	na	na	na	0.999325156211853	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

I was viciously assaulted by a 17 year old girl while I worked there.  It was awful.  

I'm 6'1 and was 190lbs. She was much smaller than me. The ferocity and suddenness of her attack on me absolutely did a number on me mentally.  She tried to kill me. 

When the police arrived, they made fun of me.  I had to leave that job.  I still have nightmares about that day.

But if/when you do share it with others, remember you won't be able to control how they react. You will only be able to control how you react to their reaction.

"It's unfortunate that society often downplays or ignores the experiences of men who have been sexually assaulted. But it's important to remember that you're not alone in this. There are people who understand and believe you. While it may take time to find the right support system, there are resources available to help you through this.

If you haven't already, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma and sexual assault. They can provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to talk about your experience, process your feelings, and develop coping mechanisms to deal with the PTSD symptoms you're experiencing. It can be a huge relief to share your story with someone who understands and can provide guidance.

You may also find comfort in connecting with support groups or online communities specifically for male survivors of sexual assault. These spaces can be a source of understanding, validation, and support from people who have been through similar experiences. Sharing your thoughts and feelings with others who can relate might help you feel less alone in your journey.

Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, and taking steps to heal from your trauma is important. Your feelings are valid, and you deserve support and understanding.

I wanted to take a moment to vent about something that has been weighing heavily on my mind. I'm a 22-year-old guy who considers himself a semi-virgin(i had visited escort two times so i cant find better term for people like me  not native English speaker and please dont place too much attention on definitions), my high sex drive is driving me crazy. It feels like torture, especially when I see so many girls confidently wearing t-shirts without bras and wearing short skirts, some of them are walking  with their partners and  same time none of them would not want to have any affair with me .  It's a constant reminder that I feel undesirable and deprived of a basic human feeling that seems to come effortlessly to other guys. this makes me feel like totally unwanted trash. you can say ""sex is not important"" ""just learn to be happy alone""  for hundred times a week at the end of the day it is basic need(literally in maslow's hierarchy of needs) and even non virgins who say this kind of phrases still complaining if they had not sex for a week. also we are social creatures and we need other people to validate and want us.

I can't figure out what's wrong with me. I'm not objectively bad-looking(5.7 green eyes, 13% bodyfat) , and I don't have a neckbeard lifestyle. I make an effort to have a social life, but the majority of girls only see me as a friend, if that. for often I can't even seem to get to the dating stage, like meeting up at a cafe or attending social events together. It's disheartening because I believe I'm a fairly normal guy both in terms of personality and looks. This constant rejection has left me feeling extremely sad and hopeless about myself.

Time keeps passing by, and I fear that if I remain a semi-virgin well into my 30s, there will be no hope for me. I've already lost out on potential experiences during my college years, where it seemed like everyone else was constantly hooking up. I couldn't  find a girlfriend which is my dream. It's a frustrating and lonely place to be. i would be happy to have loving GF rather living on hookup lifestyle but it is sign of being undesirable. if i still could not find sexual partner organically maybe i will return back to escort route to cope  but it wont be fun decision to make and most importantly i want to be feel  that i am desirable. i dont want to be escort visiter for a life.

I just wanted to share my feelings and frustrations with all of you. It's difficult to navigate these emotions when you're constantly feeling both horny and sad."	No_Car5573	post	23.51027261512786	male	White	0.9967631101608276	na	na	na	2	malementalhealth
" Listen bro, I only read the title and I instantly related to you. I’m 23. Let me tell you what I learned through a story.

I am going through the most gut wrenching, life altering breakup of my life rn. I mean I’ve been cheated on by this girl several times. I finally let go after months of chasing her. She said she was gonna find better—I just told her okay. Atp, here’s what I learned. This is a mindset. You’re not unattractive. Your focus is in the wrong place my guy. When you become comfortable being alone (by focusing on yourself and what you can do to improve) women will flock to you. They might just be friends but I have plenty of women friends who’ve all told me they’d have sex with me if it was something I was interested in. Case and point, I’m still healing. 

Focus on yourself man. When you see these women go into it with zero expectations. Bro I used to have zero self esteem. I’d cry and call my best friend saying how I didn’t see anything good about myself.  It’s still hard now? But at least I am confident that I can pull off whatever I need to to get by. I probably have 8 or nine different partners a year (I don’t really want a relationship rn). Now that might not be healthy for you but it’s literally all a mindset. Women are damn near psychic. If YOU don’t think you’re confident, or attractive or whatever they won’t either.

"You probably should pay a visit to a psychologist (not necessarily a therapist, because, as far as I can see, your problems are not that deep). There is something that you are missing, and a professional's perspective can be of a big help to you. You may have to develop some skills or reevaluate how you interact with women.

"Dear Writer,

You are not alone in this struggle. I too have suffered from this but have found peace while walking through this journey. This is what I want to share with you, and it is part of my story and walk as well. It starts off being a people pleaser. I am not saying this is what you are just what caused me to second guess myself and my decisions.

To begin being a people pleaser did one thing. It caused me to doubt myself and the choices I made. This made me anxious, and even caused depression after a second divorce. Now I live by a different method that I learned form a program. That method is my peace isn't work the cost to lose it. Let me repeat that: My peace of mind isn't worth losing at any cost.

That was a hard lesson to learn, because it caused me think about the struggle that I am facing. If the struggle takes away my peace, then I choose to hold on to the peace and say no to the struggle. Which often meant I was saying no to a person that I wanted to please. See the difference? Peace of mind is worth its weight in gold. Which will make you make some hard decisions but it's worth and it does get easier. Remember your value is about your character. If you chose a peaceful mind over chaos your character will win every time."	BreakingTV	reply	na	na	na	0.9983030557632446	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"I’m currently a 31 year old man with ADHD and anxiety and depression. I consider myself a late bloomer with most things. I didn’t start having sex or dating until I was in my mid 20’s and I didn’t have a steady job until my late 20’s (I would often switch jobs a lot before that) I displayed many ADHD symptoms such as procrastinating with tasks, losing things, forgetting what someone said during a conversation as well as staring into space a lot.


Anyway me and my father never really had a good relationship with each other. I was more of an introvert and as a result it took a while for me to warm up to others while he was the total opposite and made friends with almost everybody. He displayed many of the textbook symptoms of a narcissistic such as having an overinflated praise of himself, using other people for his personal gain and showing little to no empathy towards those who he see as beneath him. His attitude towards me had gotten considerably worse once I entered my early 20’s. I lived with my parents at the time and due to me having ADHD (I was recently diagnosed and no one in my family knows about it) I always had a very messy room which angered my father greatly. He would say very fucked up things to me such as “that’s why you are 22 and a virgin and never had a GF” and “keep this up and you will be a 31 year old virgin with a shitty ass room” which greatly upset me.


During family get togethers he would spend most of his time just messing with me in front of others and in private, “why you look so lost” he would say in a mocking and demeaning tone. He never did this to my other siblings, just me. He would randomly say “you don’t have any friends.” whenever he see me on my phone. One time when I told him I wish to have a family one day he said “your chances of even getting laid is close to none other than seeing a prostitute.” He rarely said anything good about me and each time I tell him he was being a dick and to stop he would call me sensitive and say “you need to stop taking everything seriously”. My mom did very little to get him to stop at all.


Soon afterwards he started a little business for himself which required me and my other siblings to help him out. I didn’t not want to due to his past behavior towards me but my mother convince me to help him since he was my father. He basically stopped with his verbal abuse towards me for a while (because he needed me obviously) and for the first time he actually made an attempt to develop a father and son relationship with me. 

Things were going somewhat well but I would often lose focus a lot because I didn’t want to work with him. One day my mom found out he was cheating on her with various other women behind her back. He tried denying it off course but the evidence was too damning for him and my mom left him. My mom and me along with my brother and sister moved away from him and as a result I did not speak or see him again for 5 years until we ran into each other at the job I worked at. He tried apologizing to me and said he was basically playing along when he berated me but I had nothing to say to him and I told him I would never forgive him and to never contact me and my family again.

"I recently listened to one of Alex Hormozi’s podcasts which resonated with me,

A specific mistake 99% of men overlook,

But can define whether you’ll die happy or full of remorse.

It’s not your laziness,

Even at 100 years old, you can fix it…

Not even close to fear of missing out,

At a certain age, you’ll understand most things aren’t worth it.

But the hit in the face will come from the fear of judgment that comes when we’re young.

Rather than taking decisions the type of person we want to become takes.

we let society choose what we wear, think, and even believe.

In other words,

our perception of life mostly depends on other people’s opinions.

WHICH– kinda sucks…



That’s why I decided to meditate on it.

“Would my 85 years old care about what I’m doing?”

These few minutes on that thought seem useless,

but it instantly released so much pressure from my life.

And let’s not talk about how I became authentic.

I wasn’t thinking about pleasing, but more about self-conformity.

Even if it meant being fun of by some junkies.

While having goals is a good thing

many things you are currently pursuing won’t matter to you in a decade or two.

But when you don’t give a HECK of other people’s opinions,

you can definitely be sure to live a fulfilled life.

I don't have intrusive thoughts or anything like that, but I can't help but feel like my being attracted is inherently predatory in nature. Is there a way around? Does this feeling stop?

"As no professional but a patient in psychotherapy because of other things:

I don't think it will ever stop just by itself or over time, I think you need to actively do something about it or make experiences that show you it's not the case.

And I think it depends on how you imagine yourself being attracted to a person, dating a person, getting intimate in general. So not in a certain situation with a certain person, and also no intrusive thought or image, but rather your basic image of yourself in such or similar situations, your self perception. I hope you understand me, if not I try it again.

If you see yourself somehow like a rapist, then you should work on why you have this image of yourself.
Maybe someone made you see yourself like that or told you you were a rapist just because of an absolutely normal behavior.
And confront it with the fact that you (I'm assuming because of your text) would never do such things / never act like a rapist.

If you see yourself act or behave like, let's just say, most common people who aren't rapists, then you should work on why you judge or blame that behavior when you do it.
Questions like for example:
Why would it be a bad thing if you experience, get, do,... like everyone else experiences, gets, does,...?
And again, confront it with facts that speak against whatever you find out.

Take your time and don't blame yourself because of feeling like a [counts for everything]. Just feeling like someone or something doesn't make you such a person. ... Or maybe such a thing. Why should you be a rapist? Feeling like a chair also doesn't make you a chair :D

It's because you've been all but told that about yourself by messages in mainstream and social media, and probably in school and at home too. One of the best things you can do is identify and cut yourself off from sources of these awful narratives about men, even innocent ones. It's going to be a lot harder to change this negative belief about yourself when it's being reinforced all the time.	PhoShizzity	reply	na	na	na	0.9961825013160706	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"""Adam"" is correct that the feeling isn't typical, but their advice otherwise is not good. Talking with a therapist can help you identify where the feeling originates and how to deal with it in a healthy fashion. A good first step will be to be gentle with yourself and always remember

"Obviously there are going to be struggles specific to you, but generally speaking, broader advice like “hit the gym” will get you in the right direction. 

For example, the three aspects I work my clients at are health, self-respect, and environment.

Health could be anything from dealing with chronic illnesses to increasing testosterone.

Self-respect can stretch from trauma (bullying, sexual abuse, etc.) to goal setting and developing skills.

With environment it’s about who you spend time with as well as where you spend it. This can involve cutting off toxic ties to cleaning and organising your room.

Most advice you’ll read comes under those categories, but again, what one individual needs may differ or require an alternative method to another person. 

The thing is, we could also spend all day telling you what your problems are and how to fix them, but it still doesn’t guarantee you’ll do them.

"Only a professional with a vast knowledge of your past and your current behaviors can give you specific advice which would require a lot of time and a lot of honesty from you.

""Hit the gym"" is an umbrella. You get to decide which physical activity you participate in. This could mean anything like:

- Joining any martial arts school 

- Powerlifting

- Strength training 

- Endurance training 

- Kettlebell sport

- Swimming 

- Playing basketball or tennis 

- Training for a marathon, biathlon, triathlon, or even a decathlon 

- Power walking, jogging, sprinting 

The two important things are that you establish a routine and set small goals for personal improvement in your fitness. Break your personal records. This creates a foundation for confidence in yourself and your abilities.

""Go to therapy"" is also an umbrella as there is a variety of therapies you can get involved with. Group therapy is a great option for most people.

""Pick up a hobby"" is something you can also recognize as broad advice that you have to research yourself. You know your limitations and what you're willing to invest and perform on a regular basis.

What you need to also recognize is that these aren't things you ""try out"" to see if they'll instantly improve you. They require an honest internal commitment. They need to be something that you fully involve yourself in... potentially for the rest of your life.

The medical field is getting better, but the brain and what makes us tick is so complex that they are learning new things every day.  
A lot of the work comes from within, you need to change how you think, find ways to appreciate what you have, what is positive in your life.  These generic suggestions are what starts that off.  You were fat? Worked out and got fit?  Are you proud of your accomplishments?  Working out releases endorphins that make us feel good.  Helping others is another way we can get these endorphins.  Viewing what we do as positive, is how we feel good about our lives.  This is a personal journey, no one can do it for you.  If you dwell on the negative you will only see the negative.

However, it's important to acknowledge that these individuals don't know you personally, making it difficult for them to fully understand your unique circumstances. They may not have the capacity to provide the extensive guidance and mentorship you might be hoping for. Their own lives are already filled with various commitments, leaving little time for them to dedicate to helping others.

In these online spaces, people often offer quick advice snippets or brainstorming ideas, assuming that's what you're seeking. They may present you with different options, expecting you to navigate and create your own path based on those suggestions. It's important to manage your expectations and realize that social media interactions are typically limited in depth and personalization.

If you're yearning for profound and meaningful assistance, it's advisable to seek the expertise of professionals.

"There is post after post in this sub of men conveying states of despair because of their lack of ability to find a romantic partner. Let’s have an honest and nuanced discussion about romantic love. 

It’s perfectly normal to desire affection and it’s also perfectly normal to feel bad for feeling unwanted. We’re social animals and we crave connection. Therefore I begrudge none of you for wanting a relationship. However, many of you who have expressed sadness for not having a partner don’t have a healthy view of relationships to begin with. I get being upset, but many of you are at a point of complete hopelessness and apathy over not having a partner. Do you realize that if the version of you were to attract somebody, you’d be placing an unfair amount of weight on their shoulders? If all of your purpose for living weighs on your partner, how is your partner supposed to carry that weight? It’s unfair to them. Also, I truly believe that many of you are great guys who care about ethics. So what about the ethics of your idea of a relationship? 

If you see women, other men, whoever the hell you wanna date as merely potential placeholders of a relationship, you progressively lose the ability to see the humanity in people. When you want something from people you begin to think of them more transactionally and this skews your ability to see them holistically. And you guys don’t just want a partner. You reason for going on seems contingent on having a partner. What is the likelihood that you wanting something from someone so bad is deterring your ability to understand them? And if you don’t understand someone, you won’t be able to project rather you would be compatible with them or not. And that’s insanely important when going into a relationship. It’s arguably the most important thing to consider. People going into deep intimacy with people they aren’t compatible with and end up traumatizing one another. A relationship is a sacred bond and you and your partner will be revealing things to one another that are very personal to each of you. If you’re dating out of neediness and thus not retaining an adequate level of objectivity around who you could be a healthy partner for, you’re setting yourself up to put someone else and yourself through lots of psychological strife. 

The version of you that is so needy and codependent that being single complete depletes you is the version of you that very likely can’t date healthily. 

Relationships are a beautiful part of life. I wish you a wonderful one. But relationships are not all there is to life. And it is by realizing the value of the other areas of your life that you become someone who can date responsibly and healthily. You have a lot of love in your heart and a lot of years left to find the right person to share it with. And I know you want to give your love to someone and have it be given. And you will. But first, you have to heal this life or death attachment to relationships, or else you won’t be capable to offer someone a healthy love."	alanthemartyr	post	28.51644678684441	female	White	0.005899457726627588	na	na	na	10	malementalhealth
"I agree with your position that one must heal certain parts of themselves before they can ever find a healthy connection. Intimacy is something you don’t just happen upon (but, some people do and that’s where their troubles continue—if I’m hearing you right).

I’m any event, you can still be broken and love, but yeah, you have to definitely heal the needy parts of yourself before anything else can healthily ensue.

"This is all so true and I hope guys that have this mindset see this and it helps them a bit. If  having a relationship vs not determines if you're depressed or not, you're not in the place to be in a relationship. Because if that relationship ends (most do at some point) you're gonna be just as depressed as before, if not more. 

 My last relationship was the best thing that ever happened to me, but when it ended 8 months ago, it broke me and I'm still recovering. Learning who I am as an individual has been helping me move on a lot and put me in a better headspace while casually dating because I was to the point of suicidal ideation after our breakup.

I completely agree with this but I kinda think this type of thing is a paradox. In order for people to have good healthy relationships they must not be desperate for attention but paradoxically if you want one you are already desperate for one I think the key is trying to figure out how to not be desperate which is way easier said than done and I’ll be completely honest I don’t know the answer to that.

I’m talking 0 platonic friendships never mind a damn date. Extend this out for years without an end seemingly in sight and throw in not having a passion for anything in particular in life to the mix and you have a lethal dose of depression.

"Desperation is a natural response to being deprived of a basic need for so long, and the people that say this I've noticed, are NEVER someone that knows what it's like to have absolutely no connection for extended periods of time without the ability to attain it if they wanted. It's unrealistic to expect one to not be desperate after prolonged isolation, as it is to expect someone not to be ravenous after 3 days with no food. I fantasize about sucking, fucking, and filling up all the holes of every single woman I meet with my cum. I accept this part of myself and socialize with them without showing it, with the hope that the girl that eventually finds romantic interest in me will welcome my needy embraces and unused cock thrusts with open arms and open labia as I receive the love and intimacy I've been missing for so long.

"With all due respect, this is ridiculous. A similar post was made on this sub before, and perhaps it was you, so I’ll say the same thing again.

Stop placing your value on how undesirable you are to women and start doing something. You’re a virgin because you deserve to be, and we know this because you’re acting like you don’t. 

It’s ironic I have to say this as a man practising chastity, but if women think that you’re not worth giving themselves to, it’s probably because you aren’t.

"I have ADHD, my life is a continual thinijf of ‘ I’m gonna sort my life out tomorrow’. Recently I actually have been starting to sort it out, but I believe it’s more important to commit yourself to self-improving than it is to self-improve to make yourself feel better. 

I’ve always used the analogy of: 

Let’s say you buy a puppy and go away from the puppy for a couple of months, leaving it with your parents.
After coming back after a couple of months, you look at the puppy and say to your parents ‘look how much the puppy has grown !’, to which they respond ‘ has it? I hadn’t noticed it until you said something just the .’ When you continually self-improve, it’s almost impossible to see yourself getting better until one day ( maybe half a year down the line), someone comments on how your looking good ( or some compliment about how you’re doing in life, doesn’t necessarily be about how you look), and you suddenly self-reflect and see how much you’ve come on emotionally and physically.

"Yeah I deal with similar issues. I don’t have a good answer but I just keep trying to get help from dr or therapist when I really need it and I try my best and fail at doing the shit on my to do list no matter what I feel, think, or know to be true at the time. 

I’ve been using some form of a self care/ to do list for the last few years. I keep it simple and as honest as I can. Like I only put shit on it I know I can do and should do. Like walk a mile or two a day, hygiene, work, and hobbies or dreams. Like I try to make myself do the list if I think the stuff on it is worth doing or not. I’ve tried to quit going off feelings and my thoughts but results and outcomes instead. I fail all the time and I still struggle with SI, delusions, depression, anxiety, and ptsd. 

But despite all that shit I’ve made more progress this last year or so than I ever knew was possible. I still have ruff times but I get back up way quicker now. The lows while still low are nowhere as dark as the past. I’ve gave up a few times in the past. But I’m so happy I made it this far and haven’t had any attempts in about five years. I’m so happy I’ve stuck it out. Sometimes it’s hard to remember why but I can’t unlearn some stuff and won’t let go of the little bit of self worth and love I’ve finally have. 

Kind of went all over the place but bottom line is I’m happy I’m here now and have hope for the future. I didn’t even know that could exist until my early thirties. Try and have empathy for yourself and others and the wrongs in life aren’t always you. It’s hard to tell sometimes so it’s important to have someone you know has your best interest in mind to talk with but above all be honest with yourself. It’s hard to do but look at your situation as if you where someone you live and do what you would want that person to do for themselves for yourself. Therapy and drs can help but make sure to be careful with meds and listen and ask questions. I would recommend a gene test if you need meds. Finding the right therapist is huge and way harder than it should be. Watch the results if you’ve been there months and have no progress find another. Sometimes it doesn’t take that long to tell it will or won’t work. We have to accept the bad stuff so we can face it. We need to accept the good stuff too it helps make the hard times easier. 

The hardest part for me is dealing with delusions I guess is what they are sometimes I feel all the people I’m lucky enough to have that I live are mad at me or even conspire against me. It has made having relationships hard but not impossible. I try as hard as I can not to fuck up the relationships with them even when I feel that way and know they hate me. Luckily I’ve made huge progress realizing it and I get over them in hours or days instead of months or years now. 

I have a lot of anger sometimes. I feel it’s justifiable for some of my issues. But I’m a people pleaser and when I get angry it makes me feel all kinds of fucked up ways. Guilt, doubt, worthlessness, and sometimes I can’t trust anyone even myself. That’s what the list is for. It took a long time before I could trust them or even take them serious enough to do them when I was in a bad way but it just got easier over the years. Making my body do the motions no matter what I’m feeling has been the best thing for me so far. I don’t know what’s the best for everyone and I’m sure sone things I do are not the best. But I know I’m trying and I can live with that. Acceptance while a bitch is awesome if you can achieve it.

Went on and rambled way more than I meant to but we are worth the effort Op. just keep trying to improve and be as honest, empathetic, and as present for yourself and those you love as you can. It can get better sometimes. Sometimes we can do it all right and fail. The world isn’t fair but improving yourself or trying to in any small way can never hurt your chances. Don’t forget now is the only time that’s sure so try and enjoy it. How we look at stuff can make or break us. Good luck Op and everyone. Check out peer support and I recommend ketamine therapy if you can afford it for SI. RSO oil also helps with my ptsd symptoms as fas as anxiety and paranoia. That’s just my experience though RSO or any marijuana can make anxiety, paranoia, and psychotic symptoms worse for a lot of people it seems. So make sure you try to look into everything before you try it and just take it one day at a time.

"I am a straight, cis-gendered male born in 1979, and raised in the northeastern USA by a pair of liberal Christian hippies. My mother is a former nun and my father almost became a monk. Being gentle, kind, and not at all domineering was very much normalized in my home and my parents' social circle growing up. No one knew this at the time, but I'm on the autism spectrum, so I took these principles very much at face value, and very much to their logical extent, because I don't read people well, and it was all I had.

I was bullied relentlessly throughout my school years, and it took a major toll on my self-esteem. But my parents were loving, accepting, and comforting to a fault, which, combined with their religious and political beliefs, led me to put all my hope and trust in the possibility that the world was slowly but surely becoming the place they were working to build. This faith got me through some very dark and painful times in my youth.

I used to doubt my parents' religious beliefs, and supernatural belief in general, but I never had it in me to doubt the more worldly beliefs my parents taught me. I chose to become a physician, because I wanting nothing more than to help people and help heal the world, and make a living doing something positive, rather than finding cunning ways of separating people from their money. Medical residency was the most socially painful experience I lived through. Even though I love the science of the human body, love helping people and reducing pain, and love learning and intellectual things, I never anticipated that this field would select almost entirely for competitive, obedient, and power-driven people. No one in the medical field related to me, and those that might have, were running for the exit of this profession by the time I met them.

I approach everyone as an equal. All it takes for me to accept someone and give them a chance, is that they be kind and interesting. I do not want to dominate anyone, and I do not want to be dominated be anyone. I didn't think this was a complicated or unreasonable social contract to proffer, but apparently it is. I've resigned myself to being a pretty asocial person outside of my work and my immediate family, because I've found through hard experience that to most people, especially other men, my lack of desire to dominate anyone, is by default an open invitation to dominate me.

I don't mean to belittle the experience of rape survivors. Nor do I mean to suggest that I relate to rape survivors, because I couldn't possibly. But every now and then I hear stories of [usually female] rape survivors, who feel inexplicably driven to put themselves in positions where they attract the attention of horny men, and then get some perverse (but at some level understandable) satisfaction out of rejecting them, when they dare to make a move on them in response. I've been known to do the same thing, but with power, instead of sex. I'll put myself in social situations with men, and sincerely (self-righteously, even) meet them with the expectation that they'll engage me as equals, without asserting dominance or presenting a front of ""don't mess with me"", because I feel I shouldn't have to. Then I'll get all worked up with righteous indignation and tell them off, when they take the liberty of asserting dominance over me, and expecting me to follow their lead without any reciprocity.

I'm not an incel by any means; I'm happily married and sexually active with my wife, and am raising three kids. But I sure could use some more guy friends. And I sure could use some reassurance that my finding a woman who found me attractive was not some highly unlikely miracle. When I signed up for a dating site called TheNerve.com in 2001, I was flummoxed by the fact that nearly every straight woman with a profile on the site checked ""power"" as a turn-on. Raised in an Irish Catholic family, I had two rather awkward conversations with extended family members in my adolescence, where they asked me whether I'd considered ""the religious life"". (Um... no.)

When I'm honest and articulate about what I just wrote, I tend to get a reaction midway between ""You're a beautiful person, never change"" and ""Please stop, I'm cringing hard."" Often followed by a distinct desire to distance themselves from me, because they can't decide which of these two sentiments they feel more strongly.

Be honest with me. Because I feel this as frankly existential. Have I spent my life in complete and utter denial and rejection of a basic fact of human nature, because I took the principles I was raised with at far greater face value than even the people who taught them to me?? Or have I just not found my people? Either way, what would you recommend I do, lifestyle-wise, to ensure my future mental health and social connectivity, and have the effect on the world I want to have?

Oh, and what venues of social interaction would you recommend to me, to find people (especially other men), who relate to my experience and my response to it, rather than cringe or deem me strange and maladjusted?"	hononononoh	post	27.577574222319456	male	White	0.04682973399758339	na	na	na	2	malementalhealth
"So the first batch of paragraphs, I could probably address but really you'd want a LOT of background. Works like nietzsche, John Rawls, Bernard Williams, John Locke, etc. - basically I'm saying it's not a simple answer, or even a single answer. If I'm reading you right and you've got a medical degree, you probably took an undergraduate class in **ethics**; I would suggest going back to that, because the questions you're asking about human nature are best explored in that field of philosophy.

As for your last question, I dunno if you noticed buddy but us guys are having trouble finding 'venues of social interaction' even where people *don't* relate to our niche experiences. You're making a huge ask. Not impossible, though - surprisingly, I think team sports is your best bet, things like pickup soccer (or 'football' if you're a filthy xeno who's misusing the God-given-to-the-US-English language) or a volleyball league, or even martial arts. Even boxing. Some of the most chill, down-to-earth dudes imaginable can be found in a boxing gym.

Or you could make a space like the one you're looking for, if you want, have the time, energy and organizational skills. Not easy, but the best option for some people.

"Do you struggle with attracting girls and facing rejection?

Don’t worry, it’s a skill that can be built like any other.

In fact, as important as building yourself up,

Think about it…

You CANNOT avoid it if you want high-value women for your kids.

Otherwise, They won’t evolve in a good environment.

Despite not being a professional dating coach,

trying to sell you a 768$ course that will just waste your money and time.

I’ll give you an easy method that made me more confident than ever with girls,

which helped me to understand feminine energy,

and NOW– I exactly know what type of woman I’ll marry.

You don’t need years of experience,

But just be aware of something no one has told you before.

And I believe all men can benefit from it,

from a young age to retirement.

In just a second, I will show you exactly how ‘the claims I just said’ are totally true.

But let me create a picture in your head first…

**How do you feel about your first rejections/breakups?**

Probably one of the most hurtful sensations in the world,

Can’t sleep due to overthinking,

even if you followed every advice from Redpill YouTubers 

You think she has rejected everything about your past, beliefs, and hard times.

So we tend to ignore girls,

We think The same scenario will repeat

But you’re wrong…

Every time you add up approaches,

The pain of rejection decreases.

Believe it or not, it will become a game.

You and your homies can also make jokes about your most embarrassing rejections.

I TRULY want you to learn how to get rid of that fear when talking to girls

Not to make you feel bad about it,

But to improve your communication and relationship skills,

analyze your ways of approach, level of breathing, and capabilities to be original.

Even if it looks awkward on the first tries,

Again, the goal is not to be in a relationship,

But to understand feminine energy.

within a few weeks or even days,

you’ll quickly remove that fear of talking to girls and be confident when talking to them.

Which is harder than laying in bed and watching p¨rn,

but making you ahead of most men living in darkness.

I don’t want you to be desperate at a certain age and marry a stupid one,

I want you to be ready when you see a high-value woman,

Again, take into consideration that you bring value to the table.

The other commenters are correct, you need a diagnosis. What they might not know, not having gone through the process, is that it's harder to get a psychiatrist than you might realize.

To put that into perspective, I tried various therapists and talking to my primary for most of my life, when I could afford it. It took the police finding me in the woods getting ready to hang myself - the second attempt - before I actually received full medical treatment.

You can try the normal route, ask for a referral from your primary care provider etc.; but push comes to shove, don't be afraid to walk into an emergency room and tell them if this continues you may end up killing yourself. It will at least get your foot in the door, potentially after a very few boring days hanging out in the acute behavioral health facility.

" 

Your friends, family, and most people on social media said that you shouldn’t go far with self-improvement.

That it can lead to “toxic masculinity”.

That it’s better to have fun.

you don’t know if you should listen to them.

But do they want your best after all?

Well, not really.

In fact, it’s the opposite

They want you to stay an NPC with no accomplishments in life.

So that they feel less guilty for being in the wrong.

**I know what I’m talking about, I fell into that trap!**

There was a time people were calling me to go out and have fun,

2-3 times a week, those were good moments.

But not aligned with my purpose and mental being.

I didn’t find time to record my videos and work on my side hustle.

I was being undisciplined and lazy.

A few weeks later,

Noticing that I’m worsening my physical and mental strength.

I rapidly got back to my “monk mode” routine.

Surprisingly, not giving me any support,

They called me “selfish” for not playing around.

# In this case, I consider myself a selfish person!

* Prioritizing my mental health, even I try to help as many people as I can.
* Not partying and drinking, even if my friends believe I’m a “loser”.
* For wanting to be stronger than anyone else, even if it meant doing it alone.

For those whose thoughts are still unclear

what we are building is something not taught in school and uni.

It’s not selfishness, but self-interest.

You should at ANY COST focus on your personal growth,

By cutting off people wasting your time, even if those are old friends.

The only way for inner peace is by taking rational decisions.

It’s how you become an example for kids in our generation,

and EASILY become a leader in a world where weakness is spread like COVID.

**Become more selfish “aka improving yourself” = QUICK personal growth = become a leader**

She left the house and took the kids to her parents. She lets me see the kids everyday but I want her back so bad, I want my home to feel like a home again. After finding that out it killed me, if I didn’t have my kids I know wouldn’t be here no more. Just thinking about another man had the pleasure to be with her and make a joke out of me. It hurts a pain I don’t wish on nobody, we got stuck in the routine of life and marriage got boring for her but instead of talking and fixing it she did this. I think the last month she’s been miserable because of the guilt she has of what she did. Even though she will never admit it I just know that’s what it is.

">we got stuck in the routine of life and marriage got boring for her but instead of talking and fixing it she did this. 

Been there, w/ no kids however. I couldn't eat, barely slept, and when I did, I'd dream of *them* in the act. For months. It was hell. It's been about a decade later, and while i'm not exactly living a dream life, I'm at least over that massive pit of despair I was in.

I'd say right now you have a beacon in your life that is your kids. Be with them as much as you can. Don't disparage her to them as best you can. Be good to yourself as to them.

 Yes you'll have to see her from time to time, or hear of the BS she made up to her friends/fam so they can ""YAS QUEEN"" her...fuck it all. Focus on your kids, your well being.

It's been hard, not very many people will fully understand what you're going through, but you've gotta keep moving forward, find healthy coping mechanisms, develop healthy habits and new healthy relationships.

"Oh absolutely it exists.

As for how to deal with it? A few other bits of good advice, but this is my key offering: Keep a record.

Anger's great for that. Especially if you're not otherwise disposed towards note-taking. Anger is a phenomenal motivation for taking up the practice. Write down exactly what's making you angry. Coworker or boss pulling shenanigans? Family issues? Society at large? *Take notes.*

Not only does it allow you to clarify your thoughts, which can really help and in some cases allow you to let go of anger in areas where you can compromise, but... when it's come down to taking necessary steps? When you have to do something about what's making you angry? Having those notes will be a lifesaver - or at least definitely save your sanity, and be a tool that will make you far more effective in getting a good resolution."	_Dirty_Deedz_	reply	na	na	na	0.997414231300354	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"I honestly feel like probably half (or more) of the mental health issues faced by men these days stem from the heterosexual dating scene and yeah you'll get a lot of people shouting self improvement and what not from the rooftops but it really does come down to a degree of people's perception of your appearance and how well you carry yourself.  

It's true there are certainly guys who just don't look good and I may be in that group who knows but they just strike out again and again and again.  I don't even think there is any science behind it it's just some people don't have the right look.  It's an unfair thing sometimes life gives you a body and face that most people don't find appealing and it's sad.  There is honestly only so much you can do about it.

Some of us wish we didn't feel inclined to date or meet people in a romantic fashion and that part of being a human weighs so heavily on us and the pressure gets hard to bear.  It's hard not to go through the day and notice other people with their wives, girlfriends, etc and you wish you could be in that group.

I don't know if I have much to offer as I'm in a similar position myself. The only thing I can suggest is do whatever it takes to get in a more positive state of mind and that may be you just forget about trying so hard to meet someone or go on dates.  There comes a point where you just drive yourself nuts trying to figure it all out and it becomes unhealthy.  Maybe indulge in a lot of self care and things that don't involve the same kind of social pressure that dating creates.  I do wish circumstances were different and people were more accepting of men in general but the issue is that the role of man is totally different in the western world and often men are seen almost as objects of pleasure rather than people who need to be loved.  It's basically the reverse gender stereotyping that women had back in the 50s but it's worse because the driving factors to get into a relationship are different when it's women doing the picking.  It's often much more extreme as women are far far more selective of mates as men.

So for the past 8 years I've suffered with social anxiety and really bad depression since my dad past not sure if it's linked with not been able to say bye before he passed or what but I've been struggling to the point were I've found myself in a shittu cycle of repeating the same shit I don't vent to anyone wether it's family, friends or my fiance as I don't see the point. This is the first time putting it out there and over the past 8 years I've genuinely barely felt anything over than anger and wanting to do stupid shit just so I can feel free Wether it's doing drugs or drinking habits slowly calmed down but I'm slowly going back into it, found out that I could have some medical issues with could be heart related but waiting for further tests, everyone's worried about it and I'm the only person who genuinely doesn't care I can't even explain why I'm feeling like this as I have no idea but it's now got to the point were I'm finding myself researching different things when I'm home alone on what would be best wether I stay and continue to fight or just say fuck it and leave everything behind and just end it all as I feel like that no matter what I do I'm always going to fuck up, hurt those around me and just Continue to be a disappointment and I just don't know what I want or what to do anymore as I'm just so tired and fed up I just genuinely wanna make it go away.

They refused to do it and I'm glad they didn't because not too long later, I met my wife covering a shift for a guy at another bar.

"I don't really know how it went this bad.  
I am turning 30 in a few days, I have a job and earn north of 150k$ but that's all really it(positives). I rent and have a car. I feel like I am boring as in I don't have depth to my personality, I have way too many reservations on situations where I have to go out and socialize. I pretty much lie to my relatives and cousins about my virginity, relationships(I've told I had many short term ones but in reality I am scared of girls to this date). I lie because even on average every one of my cousin has been through multiple relationships and I feel shameful of the inexperience I have. Every time I talk to a girl where I have to make effort to make it romantic or next stage I can't. I don't really have a framework for doing that. Expressing myself seems inconvenient because I've got a habit of being stomped over by people. This made me pretty much a develop a cloak of agreeableness to the point that I don't even remember the last assertive thought I had where other people were involved. I just go with the flow.   
Most of my personality and hobbies are due to my close friends.   
 I know for a fact that I had difficult time making this network of people and my own actual(true) behavior might cause them to run away.   
(Its not like I don't have true friends who know my actual plight but they are like 3 people). I know my dad and mom is not going to stay for a long time but at the same time thought of getting married(I can get arrange marriage) or going in a relationship scares me. I have that internal pressure of behaving perfectly so as to not offend anyone.  At the same time I can't come up with roasts or have that natural dynamic which people in my age get so easily.   
Every passing day close to 30 I feel I don't have much to offer to life. I was considering suicide but due to family pressure and the kind of relatives I have I can't kill myself because my relatives will take advantage of situation and start pestering and eventually exploiting my parents(they are very simple minded and humble). 

I love my parents I haven't been even hurt by both of them any time and they love me too. They are also under societal pressure of getting me married because of my not being successful in dating. They have asked my friends multiple times if there's something wrong with me.  
I got recently rejected by a childhood friend of mine but the reason I got was that was I kidding here? I had zero experiences and basically she had to work on me from start which she was unwilling to do.(Now when I think about it, she is absolutely right).  
I got bullied in my uni in 2011-2014. I tried to defend myself but the more I tried the worse it became to the point that I had trust issues and zero self esteem. I constantly watch my back.   
I don't really know where to take my life, what direction. I like my work because I like computers and I can't imagine doing anything else. And also money I had around 120k debt, 100k of which I have settled till now and it would be over soon so I don't really know what else would I be doing for the rest of it.  
I have a major problem of being able to give less f\*cks in a situation(which scares people away). I am hypersensitive and often feel overwhelmed with things that are not in my control. This is not what an ideal man is according to society(stoic) and that's why it gives me even less reasons to continue. A relationship over friendship might be way too overwhelming and I might end up running away because of small mistakes.   
It is incredibly difficult to book therapy appointments when I am slogging 12-13 hours of my life daily to work. I want to consider it on priority but I keep delaying it."	travel_cycle_eat	post	19.500618677853456	female	White	0.9991676807403564	na	na	na	4	malementalhealth

Definitely seek a therapist and talk things out.
To get an idea of what’s that like check out “therapy in a nutshell” on YouTube and also look at life journeys interviews on Doctor Chatterjee and jay shetty. Lots of great talks. Healthygamergg has good talks on self worth and moving on from the past on his channel as well.

There are things you need to let go and move from the past. To acknowledge the positives you have in your life and self worth such as being able to hold a high paying respectable job and also to overcome hardships.

The no drive and feeling empty could very well be clinical depression and you may need to seek medical help.

Things that attack depression definitely is rigorous consistent exercise. Finding a third space like the gym is very helpful. Starting on the treadmill and doing 30 minutes a day leading to an hour. Steadily increasing pace. Then working on weight lifting.

Make sure your diet and nutrition is good as well. The gut biome effects the mind so much. 

Lastly a change in scenery may give you a break from the past and reassess life. Take a road trip somewhere or flight somewhere far away. 

Trying to new things and having new experiences can open up the mind.

If you enjoy the stuff at work, then you're chillin.. You clearly don't enjoy it too much, also if you want to do drugs and party, don't do any hard drugs like meth, crack, or heroin.. You could prob try coke once or twice but it destroys your body. At parties, you could smoke weed and do extascy from time to time. Weed is the only safer reccomended one.

I’m completely alone almost every single day. I’m an only child with only one parent that is in prison that i have nothing to do with. and it gets sooo lonely. Like I’m not close with the few cousins I have and it’s like they could care less about me even when I reach out to them and I don’t have any friends because making friends is difficult when you’re autistic and have trust issues after being talked shit about so much. So it’s making me question why I’m even still living if all I’ll ever experience is hatred and contempt by almost everyone I come in contact with. I want a relationship. I just want friends and family but I can’t even have that because you can’t make people love or care about you… and that’s what hurts it’s like I’m naturally defective and missing out on a base level form of connection that most everyone in the world has and it’s so isolating … even when I’m around people I feel alone and it haunts me I hate this feeling	misanthropicman85	post	10.839276014081724	female	White	0.9980243444442749	na	na	na	2	malementalhealth

As far as making friends, I have trust issues and have had a hard time connecting with people myself so I get it. Honestly the best advice is probably what you don’t want to hear, which is to just try to care about the other person as much as possible. In conversation ask them questions about themselves (try not to ask anything too personal, like something that may be embarrassing or could be used to hurt them). Offer to help with something when you notice they could use it.

I know you're already disappointed by the organizations you've reached out to so far but it doesn't mean you stop. It's ok to be upset about all that, but keep the effort going when you can conjure up the energy. 

Aside from that, some ideas - try other religious organizations besides churches - like a mosque. Maybe they can offer a hand. Call ahead if possible to save energy.  Idk how it is in the UK but perhaps libraries are a good option to hang out in for free. As they're usually govt run, they probably have resource lists for you to reach out to.

I’m not gonna give you those dumb false hopes to sooth my own ego and tell you not to kill yourself, there are many things in this world that are far worse than death.

This has been my experience with most people, including supposed “help” services. Parents. People can’t empathize with men.

People got a taste of what I’ve experienced for the past several years during COVID. How is someone supposed to be productive when they can’t get their basic socialization needs met? There’s nothing to look forward to.

"Hello, im a 22 year old, not virgin but still an textbook incel (i had to resort to prostitutes), and being ugly really doomed me.

Its not just self esteem problems, ive suffered bullying for it, in fact people nowadays still say it.

I have gone to the gym, 2 years, and every time i complained that i never started looking better, people told me to just eat more and so i did, i got face fat, and my body dont look good at all.

I have changed hairstyles, clothing and everything trying to escape inceldom

I tried going to parties, ive drank, danced and even took drugs, all that to try and get at least my first kiss, it didnt work. Ive spent so many money in it, yet no works done

Ive tried Tinder, also 2 years, and never got to even talk to a girl, ive payed for Tinder Gold and it still didnt work.

And we all know that if after all this effort nothing works, there must be something wrong with me, and i know for a fact that im ugly short and weak. I hate myself and life so much that the only thing that keeps me alive is gun laws in my country.

Self esteem isnt a thing that you can just turn a switch on and boom you got it, all my life experiences scream UGLY, and yes ive tried therapy twice, i cant get myself to admit face to face all that

"First of all, take a deep breath and acknowledge that you're describing feelings. Those feelings are temporary, even if you can tell a story about how sadness and rejection is a thread throughout your life. It's not the only thread. It won't go away, but you really can weave it into the background. 

I know a few really ugly dudes who are married. The trick is: they married ugly women. Not sweet and humble ugly women, but mentally ill ugly women with the same resentful entitlement about being ugly. Less ugly dudes-- even hot ones-- often end up with slightly less ugly women with the same mental problems. These mental problems are not rare. Our society is collapsing and most of us are getting ground into the mud. 

I know at least one ugly dude who is happily married to a gorgeous, intelligent women (after dating a series of them). He's a musician. Not a rich or famous one. He doesn't spend all day pining for sex; he focuses on art. Women can see he's interesting and confident about what he can do, not waiting for them to fix his shitty life when he can't do it himself. I've met other ugly dudes who are wealthy, and you can imagine...

It doesn't matter if you have musical talent. Focus on your career (and maybe even hobbies) and your skills will impress women. They're honestly less visual than men are. Even a boring career will impress somebody. Even a hopeless career like helping the needy will attract attention. But you do have to care about it, even if you don't enjoy it day-to-day. 

I'm not saying you can feel fulfilled by career alone. You need relationships of all kinds to have a good life. But humans like to know what they're dealing with. If you're at the top of your field, they'll know what you're about. They get an idea of what you care about and how to relate to you. They can tell their friends about you without being awkward or embarrassed. You have no idea how important this is to women. 

But that doesn't only go for women and sex. Everyone you meet wants to figure you out and talk about who you are and what you can do. Give them a hook, and a little bit of mystery, and you'll be on their minds a lot. Feel free to lie and exaggerate for now. It's better than being depressed about it. Lies might bite you in the ass, so be careful (do no harm), but think of it as aspirational rather than phony. 

You are young and ready to take your life seriously. Don't let the abstract idea of sex steal your potential. If you had a girlfriend right now, you would cling to her until she got bored. You are trying to define yourself through love. Find another way to define yourself so that when love comes and goes, you'll still have meaning in your life. 

Keep going to the gym if you enjoy it. Or try running, biking, hiking, swimming, football. Taking pride in what your body can do is so much more fulfilling than taking pride in how it looks. 

I'm much older than you, and I've had some lovely relationships. But I have nothing to show for them. I still get depressed, I still get into stupid drama and abandon people over it, I still feel like life is pointless. But other days, I play with a dog or cook a real meal or write a good comment on reddit (not necessarily this one), and I feel fine. On bad days I might smoke weed and accomplish very little, on good days I might drink too much coffee and make myself sick. I'm gonna die soon enough anyway, I try not to take on responsibility for that.

Also, you might just be in the wrong city/town. Imagine you're gay and living in Alabama (conservative south Usa if you don't know). Your life would improve so much if you moved to San Francisco. There's a place out there that will work for you, that has the right culture and the right opportunities. Find your San Francisco."

"There's plenty of aspects of life that being ugly has no or very little impact on, such as having a good job that you enjoy, educational/academic achievement, having meaningful relationships with friends and family,  enjoyment in your hobbies, and finding purpose in your life. A lot of these things are within your control as well, unlike your face/body. 

I feel that these things are vastly more important than anything that your physical appearance dictates. They're more likely to make you feel happy and fulfilled, and they'll be with you before, during and after any romantic relationships. I also think that working hard and achieving success in these other aspects of your life go hand-in-hand with being a more attractive person to friends and possible partners, regardless of what you look like."

It is the parent's responsibility to do so. You decide to have a child, you are responsible for raising the child. If there is no bond there, then the parent has failed in their duties.

Too general of a circumstance to say. Sometimes it is the parents, sometimes a child is just not fond of affection, sometimes there are other outside circumstances. I wouldn’t really say there is “fault” in most of these circumstances however because that insinuates an active behavior leading to that effect when that is often not necessarily the case.

"I agree with the other responses telling you it would be the parent’s fault.  

They are the adult, the child is a child. Children need patience, nurturing, and understanding.  

If you are an artistic parent and always wanted artistic children, but your child is interested in athletic pursuits and there is no relationship between the two of you by the time the child reaches adulthood, who’s at fault? The child who’s it’s own person and trying to be themselves, or the adult who had preconceived notions about what they wanted in a child that when the child turned out to be an individual with its own personality the parent couldn’t look past their own desires and accept and nurture their child for who their child is?

An adult blaming their child for the lack of a bond while the child was growing up gives strong vibes of emotional child abuse.  A child, even into adulthood, able to see that such a situation is the parent’s responsibility, feels surprisingly well-adjusted."

"My dad wasn’t around much in my life. Even if he was, I got in a lot of fights with him because we didn’t get along. I have some fond memories of him from my childhood when he took our family on trips and acted goofy, but he had a dark side I could no tolerate. Our situation got desperate and he left to work overseas when I was 10. He wasn’t really part of my life after that. Thinking about it now he’s taught me a lot of life lessons that helped me despite not being around. I figured I’d write it down to know how he helped shape me. There’s no particular order for his lessons he always taught me things sporadically when I was doing something wrong.

1. “I’ll do it!” 
If someone needs help, something needs to get done, a volunteer is necessary, be the man that goes first. You have to be reliable for the people around you.

2. “Protect your mother.” 
You cannot allow disrespect or danger to befall your mother. Don’t make her do the heavy lifting and keep her safe if anyone or anything happens. 

3. “Nobody on this planet is closer to you than your siblings.”
You might have friends and people you can trust, but your siblings will always be the closest people to you. From the experiences you have together to the blood running through your veins, nothing comes close. Quarrel but never turn against your siblings, this is meant to be the person you can trust no matter what happens.

4. “You are the master of your own world.”
I’m your mind, you control what to think about and what happens. It’s your imagination and you have free reign over everything that happens in there. You are in control of yourself. Do not conflate that with being in control of the people and the things outside your mind because that is no longer your world. 

5. “Learn to make people laugh.”
It’s good to have friends, and it’s important to laugh. As long as you’re funny, you can cheer yourself up even when nobody is around. The happier you are, the more people will be drawn to you. 

6. “Respect your elders.”
These are the people that came before you. These are the people that you came from. They are the foundation for what your family currently is, they are the foundation for what society is. They are the eyes of the past watching over you, so act with honor and respect in their presence.

7. “You only need a couple of true friends.” Having connections and people to be with is great, but in dire situations you will turn to the real friends that give you a helping hand. They won’t judge you based off status, they won’t help you as a trade offer, they’re there for you. Look out for the real ones in your circle.

8. “Be strong.”
You are the protector from bad people. You are the one that has to pick yourself up when you feel sad. People are going to hurt you, life is going to hurt you, regardless of what happens you must be strong. You can’t give up, you can’t fall apart, people need you, so keep it together.

9. “Have courage.”
You can’t live in constant fear because it does nothing. You can hide, you can run, but you will never get anywhere. Face your fears, stand up to the people and the things that want to take what you care about away from you. 

10. “Be smart, composed, and disciplined.”
The man with no discipline, no control of his emotions, the loudest one in the room, is not necessarily the most fierce. Be calm, in control, and have a plan. 

Maybe he’s taught me more but I don’t remember. I go off my own rules and principles now. If anyone has any advice their fathers have shared I’d be interested in knowing."	grounded_star	post	25.81632936258187	female	White	0.0022395197302103043	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth

"Carl Jung’s concept of the shadow will teach you more about yourself and the direction you need to head towards.

Understanding your shadow without doubt is one of, if not the most important aspects of self-improvement.

To summarise, it is taking a look at the dark side within your subconscious. The thoughts, desires & impulses that you hide from others because it is incompatible with your self-image.

Jung spoke about “integrating” the shadow, which first means becoming aware that the secrets you hide from people are something worth bringing to your attention.

Accepting non-judgementally that this side of you is part of who you currently are is important — it does not mean that you can’t change the things you do not like.

Projection is a great way to identify aspects of your shadow to work one.

Saying something negative about someone else is more often a sign of what we dislike about ourselves and therefore try to disassociate from it by pointing it out in others.

A great way to work on integrating your shadow would be to start journaling and writing down the things you wouldn’t tell others on paper — it makes it easier to analyse your own thoughts from a third person perspective.

Analysing your dreams & artwork can also teach you a lot about yourself. The shadow isn’t entirely bad when we consider that most creative work is influenced by the darkness within.

Paying attention to the thoughts that prop up in your mind will also give you an insight to what you need to work on.

We often try to block out the voice in our head without realising how much we can learn by paying attention to it from a higher, meditative perspective.

For example, if your mind is reminding you that you are weak and insecure, do exactly what would make strong and secure: go to the gym; learn how to fight.

The crazy thing is, the deeper you start understanding your own shadow, the easier it becomes to read others.

Everybody as a shadow, but only few know themselves to the extent that they can strive towards self-mastery."	Sospian	post	24.31875212599158	male	White	0.0014856819761916995	na	na	na	3	malementalhealth

Your life matters, and you need to be okay with feeling your own weight in your own shoes in your own life.

"I hate to break it to you but the guilt you feel is actually coming from your mind based on past experience.  I think for you to fix this you will need to break over this barrier.  I can't promise you that people will like you or think you are or are not attractive.  But what I can say is that you could be cutting yourself off of possibilities.  And you really have no idea about possibilities with every single person you run into unless you can divorce your mind from this toxic feeling of being unwanted.  It is only derived from past experiences and it will not be true 100% of the time I promise you that.  I want you to remember something.  That attractive person you saw on the bus or what have you.  She in that moment only sees the physical you.  You have had no interaction with her, she has never seen anything you do, things you like etc.  You also know very little about her.  That's the thing about our minds, especially those of us to have been blessed with a high degree of intellect.  Our strongly active and receptive minds overanalyze and make these sweeping judgements.  And after trauma we associate automatic failure with certain people.  We ask an attractive person out, she rejects us we do this to 50 other people and we suddenly stop trusting attractive women.  And after we ask out 50 more, 100 more and we keep getting the same response so what then we start hating women?  That's what's so bad.  We think that because we've been rejected that we are flawed but we never thought that we weren't their type, that their mood was wrong or so many other things.  But you need to basically change your state of mind.  You might get rejected a lot honestly most people do.  Most men I look around and I realize there are tons of dudes that aren't attractive but they figure it out because they keep the right attitude and they keep at it.  But changing your mindset away from playing tapes of Chad picking up girls to average/unattractive guy with wife of 30 years that's the Kool aid you need to drink.  Realize that for you it's tougher maybe but the thing that will get you far is to rid yourself of an automatic failing mindset even if you go through hundreds of people it won't help.  You need to think more about how to improve or how to present a happy and positive you even in the face of defeat.  That's what over time will help you out.  Your mind is on the failure drug.  Stop seeing success as pass fail but steps such as being a bit bold, trying a flirty line, going to a group or pub. Accept failure.  Appreciate your commitment even if it doesn't work you will be moving in a better direction.  You will be learning.  Any time you catch yourself self sabotaging you tell yourself ""bullshit I'm only unattractive if I let other people define that my mind can define exactly how attractive I am"".  You need to literally be your best coach the dude that ignores the hate and knows worth that you define and not other people."	jaguarcosworthr1	reply	na	na	na	0.9973481893539429	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"Serious question that's not meant to gaslight you but to seek clarity - are you sure it's guilt that you're feeling? Guilt is an emotion associated with doing something wrong. What exactly are you doing wrong by just having the thought that you find someone physically attractive ? You're not causing any harm to anyone whatsoever purely with the thoughts only. 

Are you inferior to them though ? A person's value isn't strictly based off of their physical appearance. It definitely plays a role but it's not all that's valuable about a person. Perhaps you are inferior when it comes to your physical appearance, but it doesn't mean they're better  than you or worth more as a person. Context really matters here too. 

From my experience and from the many personal accounts I've read and heard of other guys - a lot of men are treating physical attractiveness as the end all be all. It's almost all they look for in a woman/man which tends to result in them believing that it's all they get evaluated by. 

Yea, there are people that will only evaluate you based on how they look and frankly I think you're one of them right now and so are a lot of guys. 

I'm not saying it's wrong at all to want to date someone physically attractive, not at all. But screen them for a hell of a lot more than how physicallly attractive they are. Something that's very attractive is having standards and if your standards are "" she has to be hot"" then you've basically got no standards. 

Nowadays at this point in my life, I feel tons better when I'm interacting with women because I'm in the mindset that I'm evaluating them on if I want them to be in my life or not. Example If I'm swiping through an app - I don't just swipe right on a hot girl, I look at her profile and see if she's just hot or got a personality I like. This gives me a sense of power rather than just mindlessless swiping and giving the power completely to the women to decide if I'm dateable or not. When in person, I'll internally recognize that they're hot and that I'm physically attracted to them, but I have to also remind myself that just because they're hot, it doesn't mean I actually want to spend any time with them. There's nothing less attractive to me than a hot girl that's full of herself and there's so many of them. There's so many that look down on anyone that's less attractive and spend their time putting up IG posts in their perfect poses. To me, it's such a turn off that I can't even jerk off to a hot girl if I'm aware of her shit personality. 

Start to value personality in people and evaluating their worth to you based off of that much less than just how they look. Work on your own personality such that you become a person whom YOU actually like. You weren't born perfect and no one was. I'm positive there's also room for you to look more physically attractive. At the end of the day you - you've got to become someone YOU like. 

This isn't easy, but it doesn't mean it's a process of suffering. And I recognize this comment is mostly on the 'what' to do rather than the 'how'. The how is difficult to write on and takes a lot more time and needs to be customized based on the person. I think starting on the 'what' and getting the mindset and belief system more in-line with reality is a good place to start though for you."	jaguarcosworthr1	reply	na	na	na	0.9973481893539429	no	no	strong	na	malementalhealth

I knew the words and always had flash backs of some things but when I brought them up to family I learned it was best to not do that then one day without realizing I forgot how. I thought I was the problem for letting these things ruin my life all while staying around the people doing it. The physical stoped at 18 I moved out. But with it a year or so was back on family land. Until last year.

Last year I found a decent therapist finally. She helped me see the abuse and who done it. She gave me free visits to move off their land quicker. She quit within two months but at least opened my eyes. I tried pressing charges but couldn’t because statutes. When I talked to friends and family all but my SO of 15+ years I’m so thankful to have and one sibling knew already and basically ghosted me when I couldn’t just drop it. Was wild watching whole community protect know rapist. It cost us all stability and we where homeless for a while. My mom threatened, bribed and guilted me.

Life’s still hard I struggle  with SI still. But I haven’t had an attempt in years. This last year in my mid thirties I found more joy and peace than I knew was possible. What I’m saying is I’m happy I stuck it out. It’s not perfect I don’t have all the answers and I’m not better than anyone. I still blame myself for stuff all the time. I get so angry and that turns to shame and hopelessness with aside of self hate. I try to remember no one will come to save me but there are good people out there and I’m lucky to know some. Even in the darkest times now I can feel that joy/peace even if I can’t see it or remember it. The dark times still happen but I can get up quicker now. and while it’s a fight to keep my newfound self worth it’s worth it. I’m so happy I stuck it out even though it’s tuff it’s better than I could dream and for the first time ever I have hope for a better future. 

Despite losing our place to live and most things I found so much more and only have real people now. We signed a lease on a place yesterday. I’ve been able make enough selling/flipping online and we’ve been able to qualify for a little help finally since wife couldn’t work. But now we got a place and she can. We might lose the insurance but I found anew therapist despite the really bad luck I’ve had especially lately with them. She seems to really care. She pulled up and seen how many times I tried getting help. At first she was hesitant but the more we talked the more I could tell she understood and cared. She has already done things to show me she’s serious with helping. It’s still scary from past experience. We know the bad stuff can happen I finally know the good can to. Trying if I fail or not seems to be the best medicine that and laughter and empathy. Empathy for yourself treat yourself like someone you love. Love is so scary but it can be so good. 

Sorry so long and I’m all over the place. We are worth fighting for. I like many of you have been fighting to stay alive for a long time and I’m just so happy I did. I won’t lie and say it’s all sunshine but it can get better. I’m not some pull yourself up by the boot strap guy my exercise is walking 1-2 miles a day and I’m super happy if I manage that and listing a few items. It’s corny but trying to be the help we need is helping me. Sometimes having someone to listen and not get scared at some normal feelings is nice. Rare but nice. The shit we go through sucks but we can try to help others and maybe stop someone from livening in denial of their own abuse for years. If I could help one person I would consider it worth it. I know I don’t have best mindset on some things but I’m trying and it’s finally starting to pay off. Damn rambled again lol if you read this thanks and I’m sorry your on this sub. You can do right and get wronged but it can also get better believe it or not. I ended up on a 3 day mandatory not long ago but at least it started as a voluntary. I’m bad at communicating I feel like. Just want people to know they aren’t alone and some people do try to understand and want to help."	_Dirty_Deedz_	post	26.922355964628604	male	White	0.0017754564760252833	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth

"Feelings of being alone  
Living in the minority  
Unable to grasp a hold of good feelings  
Darkness overpowering my whole being

Why me? Why can’t I acknowledge happiness  
Moment’s of peace trumped by restlessness  
Doc’s tell me its my neurochemistry  
My mind tells me I am unworthy

Undeserving of something beautiful  
Ruminating on thoughts that are hurtful   
Remembering every detail from when I was wronged  
Expecting the same outcome from each who’m I’ve loved 

This state of being has been present since childhood  
Robbing me of the pleasures of life, it’s simply not good  
Unable to enjoy what I have in the past  
Content with putting people first, and me last

Loving the idea of healthy companionship  
While fighting the thoughts of upcoming abandonment  
SSRI’s and medication were only a ban-aid solution  
Alongside external validation and substance abusing

Living against the natural grain of life  
Unable to look myself in the eyes  
Unconditional Love wasn’t something I was taught  
I always believed my existence has never being enough

I have to be more, to get the love I think I need  
To put a smile on my face and my mind at ease   
But when it comes around I could never believe  
My mind works against me to promote bad feelings

Compliments gone unnoticed and moulded into lies   
Unable to be my true self, while hiding pain behind my smiles  
I have to get out of this state, before it consumes me  
Desperately in need of some powerful healing

Can’t depend on anyone to give me meaning  
Won’t waste my life, my time is fleeting  
Today is an opportunity, to work towards a better me  
Finding ways to turn the negative into positive energy 

Finding strength rescue myself from this state of mind  
It wont be easy, but the results lead to a better life  
Well aware that it wont be a permanent solution  
But a chest full of tools to overcome the nuisances

I wish myself luck and support this decision  
To find a part of myself that wasn’t always missing  
I know its deep within me, I just have to pull it out  
I know I can do this, never again will I believe my own doubt  


  


To anyone reading this, I'm no stranger to waking up and feeling pain, negativity and depression fill my stomach. Flooding thoughts of what could've been, what's transpired and overall feeling of inadequacy. Writing is something I have recently come across and I can honestly say that it has helped me regulate myself far more than just letting the thoughts roam around in my head. I hope whoever's reading it, gives writing a shot. Whether its journalling or poetry, it's simply an expression of art. If you do it with honesty and vulnerability, you will feel the pain lift and strength take its place."

I’ll just go to an example of this I’ve seen in my own life. All the straight couples at my high school did promposals that involved the boy asking out the girl. No originality or surprise. No freedom over how the ceremony is done. Only repetition of archaic gender roles are present. Even though I’m straight, I just don’t understand why straight people act this way

"Some things in this world are objective.

Let’s take at the word “objective” to begin within.

An objective is something that needs to be fulfilled. 

For whatever reason, we were given objectives as humans. 

As men we were ordained for certain objectives that are not the same as those in women.

**You have a choice:**

Accept that you have masculine prerogatives

Or 

Spend your life trying to escape it through distractions: hedonism, video games, Netflix, etc.

Regardless of which you choose, there is no way around it. 

The biggest social construct is itself is the idea than gender is a social construct, and this will become even more apparent over the upcoming decade. 

You can kick and scream over how unfair life is and spend your time living in this mental prison

Or you can wake up reality and say, bite the bullet, and start bettering yourself as a man.

Choose what you like but remember one thing: 

No one is coming to save you.

This will definitely gain some positive attention from some of the people you're looking for.

"If you are 22 like me and have not had a single relationship, your chances of ever finding love are astronomically low. 90% of your peers have already had some sexual and relationship experience and are far more equipped and compatible to find relationships. They will go on to college and find even more romantic and sexual experiences with women. You will be so far behind them that even if you luck out and find a relationship you will utterly destroy it due to literally not knowing what to do or how to handle a relationship. What woman in their right mind would ever go for the 22 year old virgin who doesn’t know how to kiss when they can find a guy who is just as kind and compatible who is also experienced? Zero reason whatsoever to settle for anything less. Most people would never touch an inexperienced virgin with a 20 foot pole since most are conditioned to believe that is a red flag and that it is impossible for someone to be dateless and not have something be wrong with them. You are at a massive disadvantage if you miss out, you are on the bottom of the societal totem pole and no one with even the slightest hint of standards would waste their time with you when there are actual experienced adults in arms reach. 

I’m gonna be honest, it fucking sucks. It fucking sucks that I have been and am such an undesirable autistic loser that I’ve missed out on a part of life as basic and widespread as drinking water and eating food. It fucking sucks that there are literal teenagers who have more experience than me, and that I have been in therapy and doing all sorts of different programs just to start the process of catching up with them. It fucking sucks that I will have to send huge amounts of time and effort into catching up on something that 90% of the world did naturally as children.

"Well, you don’t need to be afraid. I think that it’s reasonable to have developed some of these thoughts/insecurities but I don’t think they reflect reality, in my experience. At least, women I have known have not at all been interested in my past experience/lack thereof. Instead they tended to like a lot of those things that I like about myself.

I don’t want to give cliche advice because most of it is unhelpful. What I would say is, don’t hold yourself back. Outside of dating, focus on what you want to accomplish, what experiences you want to have, your health, your finances. Be happy with yourself and be honest with yourself about what you want to improve. And have fun!

And when you are living your best life, maxing out your potential, you can look around and notice that there is a lot of opportunity to meet new people.

I wouldn't even say it's women's preferences or man's preferences or whatever. I often find that the ultimate hardest part of finding a partner or making friends, is just the initial search of finding that person. I'm not even some crazy ugly guy, I'm 6'1 and in good shape and still have my full hair, I can carry a conversation well when I get going, I speak clearly and don't fumble my words, I have lots of interests and a sense of humor so I'm not ""boring"", and the few women I do manage to come across in real life actually tend to be really warm and friendly with me. And I doubt most of you are as bad as you all think either. But I am still so alone.

I feel like the root of the problem is just figuring out where people are. My career field is almost entirely male dominated and I'm like one of the very few younger people on top of it. I have some hobbies but they're more niche and there's no real social outlet for them. I live in the suburbs where there's practically nobody my age, nobody goes outside ever, and people are so closed off towards being approached and talking to one another. There's nowhere to even just hang out for a bit and maybe meet people without it seeming weird or suspicious. And I can't exactly leave here because my financial and life situation keeps me tied down here and I don't even know where else I'd go anyway.

You could try dating apps but they aren't even realistic representations of your attractiveness or personality; you just post a couple random still photos of you from 8 years ago because you have nothing else, put in some generic bio that might appeal to the user base because you don't know how else to describe your life in some witty appealing way in 200 characters. But still, nobody on there truly knows you or can really decide on you, most people aren't even on there for dating. It's all phishing scams and ego boosts. Social media in general is full of negativity and hate and shallowness, these apps aren't even good places to meet people and the internet is full of judgement and hateful ideas. You could try bars, but it's awkward going alone, most people there suck and aren't even looking for anything, the music is always deafeningly loud, it's impossible to have conversations anyway. The only thing left is ""meetup"", where 90% of the groups are women's yoga, divorced 55+ moms, couples hikes, and investing seminars.

Sometimes when I am sad, I blame it on me just not being good enough or attractive enough. But in reality there are just so many factors that just prevent me from even meeting potential friends or partners. It's like my life is just cemented this way. I feel like most of you could probably relate. Maybe the problem isn't entirely us.

"Use dating apps just to connect and arrange dates with people you are interested in, don't be sucked into thinking they have red flags before seeing them in person. I think of my past use of dating apps and I could have described myself better, took better photos, wearing clothes that actually fit me would have got me more successful dating responses. Think this from other people's perspective and they too have crappy profiles but are great in person.

Open up your distance range to a comfortable distance you'd be willing to travel for a date and double it. 

Try multiple dating apps, not just one. Take a decent picture of your face, and a few at different locations, wearing clothes that fit. You being a taller person it's common to wear something too baggy which doesn't show off your athletic body shape and can sometimes look like you could be too skinny. 

Keep your description short, be honest about who you are, what kind of personality you have, list some interests and hobbies. 

Don't go into detail, save that for actual conversation.
Add your zodiac sign or whatever they are to your description, so many girls love to look that up for some reason.

When connected with someone and chatting, feel free to chat with them for a week before arranging a date, or ask if they'd be interested in continuing this conversation on a date? If it's too early, no worries some girls want to know more about you before committing to a date. Maybe they require a few video calls before going on a date so they feel safe at home while still sort of meeting you virtually.

What kind of date?

I guess it was because she was the only woman I’ve ever felt comfortable with but still it’s been almost two years she should be out of my head	point_it_out3040	post	19.258802866648256	male	White	0.9960863590240479	na	na	na	4	malementalhealth
"If you want to see some similar issues that you're dealing with, look  up limerence, it's the psych term for ""catching feelings"". Now, I don't know you, I don't know her, but I can suspect that some of what I can share will resonnate with you. First, let me mention that I fell for someone hard to, got broken up with, and my thoughts are only about him.

So, first, lets look at attachment styles. People with an insecure attachment style usually come from a background where emotional needs weren't being met by caregivers (parents), so we grew up searching for validation and emotional nourishment elsewhere. That's usually friends, achievement hunting, partners. If you can take a good hard look at why you feel incomplete without someone wanting you as bad as you want them, you'll start to wonder what is so broken and empty about yourself that feel like you need another person to fulfill that. 

Secondly. We often get attracted to the people that we wish we could be. We think that by spending enough time with them, earning thier trust, and becoming valuable to them will somehow rub off the traits you admire onto yourself. If you can work on your sense of self-value, you wont need another persons positive traits and compensate the negative ones you think you have. Also, try to understand that you were actually more in love with a story YOU made about HER, and she may not like having to fulfill a role that she didn't ask to play. She would eventually start to resent that you're projecting expectations and getting tired of letting you down when she couldn't be what you wanted.

Thirdly. Acceptance. You have to let go of any idea that if you get money, or six-pack abs, or any other fantasy that you have to do just that one ""thing"" to make them love you. You have to stop trying to control or influence the situation and let them make thier own choices, and if that means they wont be with you, you have to accept that. They aren't secretly waiting for you to ""get it together"".

Fourth, spend time with yourself. Try to figure out what you value, respect, and love about yourself. No person in this world is going to love you enough if you keep thinking of yourself as something not worth being loved. You will become emotionally starved if you think that you're not worth loving, withdrawing into isolation, and when someone comes along who makes you think otherwise, you'll place the responsibility of your value on them. That's not fair to make someone shoulder the burden of making you feel worthy. Making you feel worthy is your job.

fifthly. Even if she was madly in love with you, and could bring you happiness, you wouldn't be happy for long. Once the happiness wore down, you'd start to worry about losing them, or them cheating. She'd never be able to convince you enough that she loved you endlessly, and was ultra-loyal. And even if she could, fate has a way punishing lovers.

I wont pretend to know what you two had, I can only tell you that when a good friend wanted to be closer, and introduce casual sex to our daynamic, I felt like a starving man at a buffet, and I oversaturated him with affection and started putting him up on a pedastal. He felt smothered by my affection and blocked me IRL. I feel stupid, empty, hollow, numb and raw af. I had to learn the hard way that I had to love myself first, before I could look for it elsewhere.

I know every day is agony, because you keep replaying the good memories and good feels in your head. But those come attached to the bad feels too. You'll have to let both good and bad memories/feels go, before you start healing.

Look into Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous meetings. There's plenty of virtual mens group meetings I think you'll find a lot of resonnance with.

As a fellow love-sick puppy, I'm rootin' for you mate. Hope you can find some peace soon, and me too.

*****edit****

I can also share that no other guy exists for me. It's hard to hear things like ""have a one-night fling"" or ""try casual dating"" when no one measures up to The One. So I know that if I did try dating, I'd be one of those assholes who would constantly bring up ""him"" during dinner. I wouldn't recommend trying to date until you catch yourself checking a girl out, and NOT thinking ""she reminds me of Her . . ."""	point_it_out3040	reply	na	na	na	0.9960863590240479	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

An easy example is dating- I used to have a short list of 4 things I required, but I never got anywhere sticking to that, so I backed off and don’t attempt as much. Now, my hobbies have a lot of proximity to stuff where I end up just seeing women that would never, in a million years, date me, let alone the fact that I could even meet someone like that.

"I'm 25, kissless virgin. I was brutally rejected 3 times by girls I asked out from the age of 14-16, (girls I knew and had a rapport with) and when I was 16 after my best friends all smashed up my dad's car one night and excommunicated me. This totally destroyed me and I haven't had any friends or girlfriends since. I never went to college and just worked blue collar jobs for 6 years and 60 hour weeks.

I tried to leave in 2020 and went backpacking Europe which lasted 1 month before COVID hit and ruined everything. (Whole thing cost me $6000). I went back to my job and worked some more until last year when I left. Fast forward a year of ""self improvement"" and while I got my drivers licence, and got a good body from working out and did a few other things I was putting off, I was swindled of $10,000 by the whole FTX scandal. I live with my parents which has allowed me to save up some money but there aren't good employment prospects around here and the job search is a little demoralising and moving cross country is not something I want to do.

Plus the penny dropped recently that I've only ever talked to two girls my entire life for a total of 4 hours combined. And that was while travelling. I'm usually a positive person but I've been hit by a train of depression recently. I'm not a bad looking guy, (a Chad lite some might say) but I've realised recently that women seem like a totally different species and whenever I'm in the vicinity of them I just freeze. Women who are even moderately okay looking I'm absolutely a million miles away from ever talking to them. I feel stunted to the extreme and I don't know how to fix it. The prospect of me falling in love and getting married has gone from being something I wanted to do to a pipe dream like playing for the Yankees. I look at the way girls my age act and the blackpilling statistics on birth rates and single male virgin percentages and I feel totally powerless. Those same girls I used to chase in the playground if they talked to me today I'd probably burst into tears. I know this is not a normal way to be thinking and most of the sadness is coming from the sheer fact that 16 year old me wouldn't have got out of bed if he knew this was where he'd be in 10 years. I need some perspective and a way out of this mess that doesn't involve me doing cold approaches in Target."

You need to get rid of that notion asap - they piss and shit too (it's just they do the former a little differently). They have hopes and dreams and fears just like guys. If you put women on a pedestal you are going to cause yourself all sorts of problems:

* It makes speaking to women harder.
* It leaves you open to be messed about in a toxic relationship.
* It will put a lot of the right women off - who wants to date a lapdog?

"Alright OP, let's get real.  


I have one very important question for you.  


Are you **worth** being in a relationship with?   
Do you bring anything to the table? Any interesting stories? Jobs?  Hobbies?   
Can you support a family on your wage? Do you have a support network of family or friends that your spouse could rely on if theirs failed?  


You **want** a relationship. But are you even **ready** for one? What expectations do you have of your partner? What expectations of yourself? Can you meet those?   


But more critically to the point---Why **should** someone want to be with you? ""I'm nice! I'm supportive. I'm loving and open minded"" are not reasons. They are platitudes and the absolute basics for any relationship.   


The fact is, men have to bring something to the table. Hell, we gotta build the table alot of the time. Our value is what we build. Our legacy. (It is why historically, generational wealth was so important)  


Not to be mean. Fact is, you and all of us are competing in a world where the wealthiest among us can fly girls out from around the world. Most men aren't in relationships. Most women are. Wanna take a guess how that works? Lol (USA based anyway)  


So, not to be candid or overly pointed, but you gotta build yourself into something people would want to be with. It's that simple. Competition is stiff so you gotta either specialize or work very hard.  Good luck, OP.

"There's a book that might help you. It's called [Models](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12633800-models) by Mark Manson. The book has some advice on how to both be authentic/honest when meeting people while also having a bit more success asking women out on dates. There are summaries online also. The main ideas are to practice being vulnerable, which is actually a sign of confidence, and also to quickly filter out who is interested, not interested, or maybe interested while constantly shaking off rejection along the way. I think that some of the advice indirectly applies to making friends (ones who aren't shitty people) so take a look.

Also maybe think about getting into therapy or guided meditation or something as well. Those might help you tame intrusive, negative thoughts and help you to be more mindful/grounded. It's unfortunately true that being anxious and depressed will always keep people at a distance from you.

But women don't get unlimited support. Trust me, people dredge up the post behavior of women all the time to mock them.

Besides, a second account isn't going to stop people from mocking you if they want to mock you for asking if you should buy a 5K+ watch now or wait until you're sure you can be a pilot when you're also worried if $170 is too much to pay for what I assume is a flight that lets you see whether a school will be a good fit for you, or just getting started asking people how to start being a pilot twelve hours before asking about the watch.

I'm not judging or mocking you. I'm sorry that people aren't engaging with you in good faith. People are assholes and unfortunately you can't control how they treat you. But you do need to accept that they look at your post history and see erratic, maybe manic behavior. That's enough for lots of people to point and laugh.

"There are little to no resources to help someone like me get any form of support or structure. Everything that I am and everything that I have accomplished in my life has been entirely on the back of my own stubbornness. I'm tired now, though. I'm 34 and I feel old as shit.

I'm tired of having no help with fucking anything. It's madness. My most recent extreme disappointment and what prompted todays despair cycle is that I've been asked to leave my home. Additionally, I had somewhere set up to work during the day so I can build my woodworking business but the people that rent the space have decided that I'm not the kind of person they want around because I'm not family orientated.

So where does this leave me? Basically I can't open up my business if I can't store and post my stuff, which is fine because I can't make new inventory anyway if I don't have anywhere to work. So, great. I've started posting ads to rent a garage or something, then I can just work during the day and sleep in the woods at night but it's really not looking good at all.

I'm just really tired of doing everything right and being met with nothing but blank stares and obstacles. I've had nothing but the cold shoulder from both institutions that are designed to help me and the people in my life, pretty much my whole adult life. I don't even qualify for emergency housing because I'm a single male.

Isn't that insane? Like what in the actual fuck?? Like I can't build my own shelter because it's illegal. I'm not wanted by my own family. I can't find a job. I can't find rent that is affordable. There is nowhere for me to go short of literally moving country or going to some warzone or some fucking shit that means I can't pursue my career. I basically have to sacrifice everything that I've worked for and gut my future in order to survive? A future that took me almost 2 decades to get towards. How is that fair?

Fuck, man. And you know what, I've been doing this long enough to know that I'm just shouting to the sky. Friends? Family? Everyone cares to a point and after that point it's adios. People can justify anything. Bunch of fucking animals playing the modern human game.

There used to be a time in my 20s that I used to be complaining about the same things. The difference between then and now is that I've tried everything to remedy the problem. I've reached out to countless organizations. I've looking for community. I've rented, married, befriended. I've worked so hard at something that it's all I did for 12 hours a day for months on end. And now that I'm finally at the point that I can potentially succeed, the rug gets pulled. None of it matters. No one gives a fuck. Dating? Have you seen dating lately? Trying to meet someone? Trying to even meet a fucking friend? Good luck if you're not an idiot, not a successful idiot and not a handsome idiot.

You know what it feels like to be me? It feels like in order to get any sort of help to be happy or support to be functional I have to be extreme as fuck. Because I'm such a level headed fucking moron with no drug habits, no active suicide attempts and no murderous intent -- I get largely ignored. They think, look at him, he's just fine. He's trying to better himself. Yeah well I'm not fine. I fucking never was. Throw me a bone here fucks sake because I'm really just about done at this point.

"Has anyone ever noticed how whenever someone wears a nerdy shirt in public, how people react and treat that person depends almost entirely on how attractive they are. I’ve experienced this many times before in school and at work. If an even mildly attractive guy or girl comes in with an anime shirt for example, coworkers and customers would go up to them and directly compliment them and chat with them. But if they are ugly, people will ignore them at best and actively talk shit about them at worst. Many times at work I’ve overheard both customers and employees making fun of that person and insulting them, and I myself have been openly made fun of and bullied unprovoked for this kind of stuff.

It pretty much seems like if you are ugly and have unpopular hobbies, you better walk on eggshells in public and carefully watch with almost surgical precision the atmosphere you are in and what kind of social circle you are in if you ever want to indulge your interests without people viewing you as a freak.

Anime is probably the greatest example of this. If you are attractive and openly like anime, you’re considered cute, dorky and quirky. If you are ugly and like anime openly, you are seen as weird at best and creepy, obsessive, and one dimensional at worst.

If you are ugly and not particularly popular, openly liking anime or manga is basically total social suicide in the vast majority of circles, especially if you are in school or college. The vast majority of people think anime fans are all Chris Chan level manbabies who never shower, live in their mom’s basement, pee in jars, cum on figurines and spend all their time arguing over lowering the age of consent on 4Chan. It is extremely popular to mock and bully someone for liking anime, and most would never touch an anime fan with a 50 foot pole.

Owning anime merch is even more obvious. There are people like CDawgVA who can openly wear a JoJo shirt live at a convention and nobody bats an eye because he is attractive and popular, when it’s abundantly obvious that if some overweight balding 25 year old did something like that, people would look at him and think his room is filled up with towers of pee jars and dirty underwear. It’s seriously disheartening and unencouraging it is how much people judge you and how poorly they treat you for being unattractive. 

This can expand to include a lot of other things, not just anime. Most women are repelled by video games, comics, superhero movies, figure collecting and painting, or role playing games. Being passionate about your hobbies if you are ugly means being passionate about socially acceptable hobbies like sports. If you are attractive, you can openly have whatever interests and hobbies you want without having to worry about people giving you shit for it all the time, and you will actively be rewarded for it. If you are ugly, you get to spend the entire rest of your life desperately trying to prove to people that your looks and hobbies are not representative of your personality and that you are a good person worthy of love and respect. If you are ugly and have any sort of unpopular nerdy hobbies, you are expected to desperately hide them at all costs when interacting with other people never giving any sort of indication that you have them unless someone mentions it to have even the slightest chance of ever finding social success. Most people will only ever care about your passions if it is something socially acceptable, things like sports, fitness, or art. Even if you aren’t interested in them that much, if you want to fit in and conform you best be finding a popular football team to support or watching the big trending show on Netflix. Being “unique” is unattractive if you are, fitting in and conforming is the best you can do.

Ugly people simply are not allowed to openly like or do anything. That privilege is reserved only to the attractive. Anything you do and say will ALWAYS be repulsive and disliked by everyone who forms their first impressions and opinions on someone based on how attractive they are. My hobbies are ugly and repulsive because I am ugly and repulsive. No woman with even the smallest hint of standards or self respect would touch an ugly dude who collects lego or draws fantasy maps for fun."

"I’m not the best looking guy.  I’m also middle aged.  Kinda overweight too.  I use to have more hair.   I also been watching anime and reading manga since I was in high school.  I also like math and programming a lot!  I did crossfit for a few years (my poor back), martial arts too.  

Lately i’ve been getting into mechanical keyboards.  It’s pretty fun and the community seems to warn me to stay away.  lol… which, now I know why. 

Friendships have bloomed and withered.  Romantic relationships too.   I’ve done hobbies cause my friends or partners were into it.  Sometimes they weren’t and I made time to explore things without them. 

For me, when I did a hobby or thing to earn someone else’s favor, it often ended in sadness, regret or disappointment.  My life is happier without trying to be worthy in their eyes.  That’s too much power to give to someone over my feelings. 

When I met people who were into what I was into, those relationships became stronger.   Friendships or romantic.  

Having a shared interest around something is what brings people together.  I get along with who care about the stuff I care about.  Go figure.  When my interests change, or theirs do, the relationship changes or diminishes.  But, if we meet again we always have those good times we shared, and sometimes that becomes the shared interest.   

And to address the good looking people get more attention point, well obviously!  People are drawn to attractive, rich, charismatic people.  It’s natural.  But they’re still people like you and I.  They’re likely more than just their looks and they like stuff too.  

And, trying hard to make people like you is one of the most repelling behaviors you can do.  At some point they or you will figure out how fake it is and will taint the whole relationship.  Even the good times will be questioned if it was real or fake.  I hope you don’t do that.

I'm not a girly girl. I don't wear dresses. You will find me wearing Initial D baggy T-shirt and jeans. Ponytail. No makeup.

So trust me, girls do feel your pain. You're not the only one that goes through this.

Adding, I am the girl that gets put in the friend zone. Because I'm so easy to talk to. Easy to hang out with. And the guy goes for the attractive girl where they have nothing in common with. She just looks pretty.  

I get guys that talk to me sometimes because they will see my Stargate tattoo or assassin's creed tattoo and the girls will give me the stink eye because I'm having this full blown conversation with her guy and she has no idea what we're talking about. The pretty girl on his arm.

"It's true that if someone's not attracted to you, having a cool hobby isn't suddenly going to make them attracted. Attraction for many people isn't hobby-centred, but personality and appearance centred. 

For example, I would think nothing of a guy spending hours putting together Gundam figurines, if I thought he was gross and creepy. Everything he does might seem gross and creepy by extension. But my super lovely, kind and funny partner spending hours meticulously building Gundam models? Very cute and sweet, because he's cute and sweet and I'm attracted to him. I think it's just how attraction works.

Ultimately I think that if someone doesn't like you, you shouldn't care what they think about your hobbies. The people who mind don't matter, and the people who matter don't mind."	Western_Quantity_103	reply	na	na	na	0.995318591594696	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

Lesson Learned the Hard Way

Next time, when you feel with low self esteem, question the Level of your Discipline.

Self esteem is very hand to hand with Discipline, Mental Toughness & Pain Tolerance. The Less time you spend in the comfort zone, the Higher your self esteem shall rise.

When you enhance your Discipline, it's more likely to reject any thoughts of insecurity popping up in your mind. Remember, Hard work and consistency beat talent, without exception. The mere Striving to Be the Best Version of Yourself, even if you are an amateur requires Persevering Discipline, that will shield you from any insecurity. 

You must raise that self esteem of yours.

Master your Insecurity 

Here are some tips:

1. Get to the gym. Workout is extremely beneficial for body, health and mentality. 

2. Belief - You must believe in yourself even in the Grimmest of Storms on your Journey. You owe it to your Best Version.

3. Strive Hard for being the best version of yourself. Focus on the things you are able to control. Like your reactions, your behavior, your discipline, your emotional regulation.

4. Prioritize Discipline and the confidence within you will rise up. Do things that will benefit you in the long term, even if they are uncomfortable now. If you don't feel like it, remember, Discipline is more important than Emotions. And also more beneficial.

5. Practice dominating your triggers. You will always be at a disadvantage if you get triggered and react to every bullshit that happens on your path. 

6. Take more risks - If you are afraid of Risk or Failure, Remember that Comfort Zone and Inaction Killed more Dreams than Risk and Failure ever did. The thrill of the risk will boost your confidence and toughen your character.

7. See this obstacle with the insecurity and confidence as a Challenge to Conquer, which Gain will Level you Up. Don't back down from challenge. Run towards it. Life is tough but you are tougher.
Train it like a muscle. Keep practicing. Strive hard, Try hard, Work hard, Die hard. Convince your mind to be tough and push your limits.
There's no Growth and Improvement without Pain & Struggle.

I also had insecurity and confidence problems. The secret is never giving up and keep pushing. Sooner or later your mindset will accept the terms of your perseverance.

8. Comfort zone is your enemy. Use it only to rest and take a break."	point_it_out3040	reply	na	na	na	0.9994542002677917	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"Hey man

You do have good qualities, it's the reason you're here in the first place rather than using your resentment against others

Don't pay attention to what others are doing. We all walk different path. 

Your focus should be on establishing some basics: eating healthier is a great start. 

A lot of what causes us to feel a particular way is worsened by poor health.

I want to invite you to make two changes in your life, and don't worry, these are pretty bearable.

First is to get half an hour of direct sunlight, every single day. Even if it's cloudy or rainy, the sun will still do it's magic.

As you start feeling better, try to get a consistent sleeping regiment in check.
By consistent, I mean waking up the same time every single day, ideally 9am or earlier.

"Therapist here. 

Long term cocaine use can lead to depression and alterations to our cardiovascular system and how dopamine functions in our brain. 

For example, dopamine receptors remained primed even after periods of non use. So that a single use post sobriety returns the brains tolerance use to the same level it was prior to they stopped. 

Cocaine is bad for building a quick tolerance requiring an increased amount required to get a similar feeling. Which increases the cost ; both physically, psychology and financially. 

People have stated they loved it, even though it was costing them their job, relationships and/or access to their kids.

Bupropion is pretty well known, with a much lower abuse potential (high doses are pretty much intolerable to produce euphoria / addiction).

I'm not trying to encourage your logic. But if there's something else there that you're thinking about, I'd recommend talking to your doctor.

"I will present to you an alternative meaning to life:

The following explanation to the meaning of life proposes that there is a God, and defines God as a being that is omniscient and omnipresent. 

If a God is all knowing than what can it possibly know of ignorance? 

In order for a being to truly be omnipotent it must also have a knowledge of things that only be learned through ignorance.  How could a being that knows everything know the intrigue of discovering something new?  Or the fear of experiencing something dangerous and unknown?  Or the joy of hearing a jokes without knowing the punchline in advance? 

In order for a God to truly be all knowing it must inject itself into something ignorant, such as mankind.  To avoid from becoming ""all knowing"" itself, thus defeating the point of the exercise of being ignorant.  Furthernore, people must be refreshed of their deeper knowledge through both death and by being reborn as newer generations devoid of knowledge. 

Death, pain, and confusion....but also joyful surprise, curiosity, and wonder...is the point of existence as they ultimately serve as tools to better inform God the experiences and perspectives of something that does *not* know everything.  It is only in this manner can God understand all creations and perceptions that extend through these emotion. 

Through our ignorance we are a way for God to escape from itself, become knowing of its absence, and thus become truly omnipotent. 

Appendium 1: Is it even possible for a being who knows everything to invent?  Is omnipresentism perhaps a closed system?  Would it be possible for an imagination to be available to a consciousness who defines itself as ""All-Knowing""?  Does imagination, by definition, suggest the existence of something unknown?   Might ignorance (personified by our existence) serve as an engine of innovation for something greater? 

Appendium 2: Living beings are the only things in this universe capable of being pro-active, everything non-living (rocks, water, etc) are strictly re-active.  This statement proposes a model of reality that includes free will and excludes determinism and so it is at odds with everything I said previously, but it is interesting to meditate upon if either:
A) You cannot imagine the existence of God, defined by the terms outlined above.  
B) You can imagine, or already subscribe to, a model of reality that reconciles free will and determinism co-existing."		reply	na	na	na	0.002350057940930128	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"I think my problem is that I’ve always been completely alone. There have been times when I did have people around me, but I was still completely alone then too. It’s like every part of me except my physical body lives on another planet, completely alone, so it doesn’t matter if there’s people who try to connect to me in this physical world, the core of me is totally alone either way. 

I’ve read about how being in solitary confinement can drive people crazy, and I think that’s what’s been slowly happening to me. There might have been people around me at points in my life, but none of them ever made me feel less alone, so I’ve been stuck in my own form of solitary confinement my whole life. And now it’s been going on for so long that I can feel my consciousness trying to drift as far away from my physical body as it can, because it doesn’t belong in there anymore, I feel like I’m too much consciousness forcibly crammed into a vessel that wasn’t designed to contain it, I’ve outgrown my physical form.

Today was the first day where I felt disgusted to have a physical body. It feels like a violation to be tethered to it. I’ve had body image issues in the past, but this wasn’t that, I was looking myself in the mirror and even just realising that there’s hair that grows out of my face that I have to constantly trim or shave made me feel absolutely disgusted to think about it. I kept having an intrusive visual of just gripping myself by one shoulder and tearing it forward to somehow separate my physical body away from my inner consciousness, and just throwing my physical form limply to the side, to fall in a heap on the floor, like a pile of used laundry after a long day. Having a physical form disgusts me.

All day since that realisation I have just felt total anguish at the idea of being perceived physically, and I can feel myself trying to disown this body and float away without it, only to feel tethered and grow more resentful.

Now yeah most normal people including myself don’t have to do even half of what I tell you in order to find social or romantic success, but you are fundamentally flawed at your core, and must forge yourself into an unrealistic comic book superhero to have even the slightest hopes of ever finding happiness.”

“Nobody wants to deal with “depressing” or “weird” people bro! You must mask your eccentric traits 24/7 to be perceived as normal and forge yourself into a paragon of emotional control and discipline who never under any circumstances stances opens your mouth about any of your problems. You aren’t worthy of love if you are depressed, autistic, or present any sort of mental health issue that might even slightly inconvenience others.”

“You’re clearly a bad partner bro! This is why you are single bro! Relationships are always supposed to be perfect and mutually fulfilling and pleasant 24/7 with no sort of hiccups or “negativity” whatsoever. The moment that cycle is interrupted to any degree and you present your partner a problem that might even be slightly perceived as a inconvenience or “red flag”, you will be dumped and left to rot alone.

(guess what, almost any problems you can think of are insignificant compared to North Korean internment camp prisoners. Suffering isn’t a contest, you don’t get to gatekeep and invalidate what people are allowed to feel bad about because someone somewhere else has it worse, who you clearly don’t give a single fuck about 99% of the time except to put down other people’s problems).”


“Everything is obviously your fault bro. Clearly you have struggled and are struggling because you are a toxic, lazy, narcissistic, entitled incel who sits in his basement all day without doing even the most barebones level thing to improve themselves. The world is just and fair, happy people are good and strong and sad people are weak and lazy, and it’s YOUR fault that you have struggled or continue to struggle. You got bullied in school? Well it’s your fault for being weird and not conforming or socializing enough. You have weight problems? It’s your fault for being a lazy fat ass and not having a perfect diet. You’re poor? It’s your fault for being a lazy asshole without good money management. You struggle to make friends or find relationships?

"People give counter-productive advice to what is commonly counter-productive questions. 

For example, maybe you shouldn’t spend your entire day building something or sacrificing all of your time for a result, like going to the gym and allowing the gym to become the most meaningful thing in your life. So it’s not healthy to advise someone else to do so.

But also, when people constantly ask questions like “ I hate myself and my life because I don’t have ___ ‘ , they’re asking a question through the lens of hedonism. Basically asking “ how can I get stuff because life isn’t worth living unless I have stuff . “ 

The healthy medium is doing something habitually that gets you a desirable result, but also realizing that life isn’t just about consumption or having other things make you feel good. One of the core tenants of becoming an integrated adult is filling your own cup. Too many of the questions that poke for advice are stemmed from a lack of desire to fill one’s own cup."

"When it comes to advice if you go on an internet forum in which none of the people know your life history and the things you have tried to alleviate and/or cure your issues, you are going to get very generalized advice. Of course. The best advice is tailored to the person the advice is being given to. So, you need someone that knows you really well and knows everything you have done so far so they can give you good advice. Unless you write a novel explaining everything about your life and everything you have ever done to overcome obstacles AND someone here has the patience to read through it and respond with thoughtful and detailed responses, you will never get the advice you seek. Only a super close friend/family member/life coach/therapist who have known for a while could give you such advice. People recommend exercise because for 70% of people on here probably live sedentary lives. People recommend eating better because there are a lot of Americans on here who probably eat like shit. People recommend cleaning your room and self care because a common symptom of depression is that people give up on taking care of themselves. Yes, this shit is generic. Yes, this shit is obvious. But there are people who don't do these things. And these are the only real pieces of advice you could give to a person who is going through a mental health crisis. Self improvement is male centric because women aren't expected to self improve in order to get sex or intimacy. They can simply exist and they will get it, even if it isn't the ideal. That is just how things are.   


I get the frustration and the anger, I totally get what you are feeling and saying. But you won't find salvation here. If anyone has their issues solved through a response on here they probably aren't struggling with genuine depression. These diseases aren't something random\_redditor45 can deal with. As much as I hate the common refrain of ""Why don't men go to therapy"" you would probably benefit from a mixture of group and one on one therapy if you can afford it.

"Example:I have a tough time accepting luxuries. 

Examples of the example :

\- Why buy a PS5 with its accessories and games and pay almost $1000 when I can play my old PS3 games which I've never played for a tiny fraction of that? 

\- Why rent a decent apartment in my overpriced city for 2k, lonely AF, when I can live in my parents' home (who want me there) for $0? It's not like the people I'm attracted to will find me attractive either way and want to live with me, date me, or fuck me (opinion based on experience)

\- Why pay hundreds if not close to 2k as well for a new laptop rather than enduring the odd issue with my 10-year-old laptop? 

\- Why buy a dedicated footstool rather than use a cardboard box with a blanket or some old sweaters on top of it? 

\- Why buy a luxury car like a Tesla for 60k when my 10-year-old basic Honda is paid for and would cost less for everything? 

\- Why go beyond necessities when there are so many people suffering for these necessities? Why work my ass off for basically a retired lifestyle when I'm already living the retired lifestyle? 

I'm not really happy with my lifestyle. I'm 30 and live in my parent's home, yet I can't bring myself to put in the ton of effort needed to change. I do have ADHD and depression but I don't think those inhibit me as much as you may think in my case. Even when now they're not as debilitating as they once were, I have a hard time justifying enduring a lot of stress for what feels like little in return + the fact that it would mean that I'm diverting my money towards luxuries and not helping others makes me feel guilty and ashamed. 

I didn't choose my privileged life and at the same time, I didn't create the problems that people in poverty live in. I'm a minority in a largely white country and don't have much power. While I don't think I really owe some poor person on the other side of the planet anything, I also feel for them as they also didn't have a choice in the country and life they were born into. 

I can't get myself to go all-in on being hedonistic and purchase all the game systems, all the tech and toys and services, and I can't get myself to be fully altruistic. I also am frankly disappointed and upset that if say I want to go all hedonistic, I can't do that without doing work I don't enjoy a lot, only to be really lonely because I'm honestly not attractive enough for the people I'm attracted to. And when it comes to friendships, I've just gotten so sick of people's BS that while wanting people in my life, I'm also so sick of people's BS. 

I can't figure out the grey area. I'm having a hard ass time with it. This All or Nothing mindset is something that permeates many areas in my life and while at times I can address it well, it's extremely difficult in some of the most important areas as I explained above working, where I live, money.

"Do you think this might be an issue of you not valuing your own happiness? 

You sound like me, and a lot of these issues disappeared for me when I prioritized my own happiness, which you sound like you get, but is it possible you don't even understand what would make you happy? Or if you would even value it if you knew? 

There are also times when you must come to terms with the fact that what you might have imagined for your ideal happiness may not at all be reality, thus making your happiness a delusion. For instance, maybe you think it would make you happy to have a girlfriend, but you find out that women in general don't really make any great effort to empathize with or care about men, which would be an integral part of being your partner. In that case, the happiness of having a girlfriend was just something of a societal delusion. In these scenarios 

Listen to the internal balance that dictates your happiness. I think most humans are actually quite good at this, but usually have their correct choice repressed by society. From the previous example, you'll probably know that there's probably some girl out there, but it would be so time consuming to look for her that it would distract you from your other happiness goals. Thus your balance shifts, pay close attention when these shifts happen and I say you should follow them exclusively. Society likes to tell you that your shifts are wrong and you should adjust to it's whims, but we all know by now that society doesn't admit that it's doing something wrong under any circumstances, so I find it unhelpful to factor in what society says most of the time."	reasonableanonymous	reply	na	na	na	0.9869886636734009	no	strong	strong	na	malementalhealth

There are actions that can move our life forward that are actually *very* small. Let's say you wanted to switch jobs. Writing the first draft of your resume might only take 20-30 minutes. That's a small action you can take today. Stack those.

I understand that doing \^ is a lot harder than the way I've written it, but I have found every single time I'm in ""all or nothing"" or ""analysis paralysis"" mode, a helpful tactic is to ask myself, ""what is the smallest next step I feel comfortable taking right now?"".

"I recently was prescribed antidepressants after seeking help in therapy. For context, I struggle with persistent and deep feelings of loneliness. I have for most of my life, but they became much more severe once I moved to a major urban area for the first time in my life. After a year in the city I failed to generate any real new friends or romantic interests. I think for most of my life I had always assumed once I got to the big city there would be plenty of people to date or who would have common interests and could become good friends. Needless to say despite trying apps, meeting people at social events, trying to link with friends of friends, and being friendly and politely curious to most everyone I meet (my neighbors, servers at restaurants, etc.), I have nothing to show for it. 

I have been told both in therapy and real life that I should take a break from seeking connection with other people and just ""focus on myself."" Frankly, I do not know what this means and have not gotten any substantive answers either. Just seems like something people say when they don't have anything else of substance to say. I've also heard it from a diverse array of people so it leads me to believe it started somewhere (a book, podcast, TikTok, etc.). 

Given that my depression stems from loneliness I have a hard time reconciling how spending more time alone could help improve my situation. While my depression is well managed overall, I do generally lack interest in doing things alone that I otherwise enjoy. It depresses me to travel alone and see friends/families in the airport. I like going to restaurants but likewise got downed by other people having substantive and caring conversations with others at their tables. The other day I went to the grocery store and saw someone I went on a date with last year holding hands with someone else. It pained me way more than it should have.

Does anyone have any advice? I am a 25 y/o male, educated professional, living in an urban area. I should be the last person who wakes up most days feeling so alone."	Fromage_Gustave	post	31.596195227118933	male	White	0.9982155561447144	na	na	na	6	malementalhealth
"Focusing on yourself is essentially disregarding any priorities other than those which will serve as an asset for in the future. 

As a coach I’ve broken it down into three categories that crossover one another:

- Health
- Self-respect 
- Environment 

For example, improving your health will directly relate to your sense of well-being & longevity, while exercise has been shown to be more effective than antidepressants.

Self-respect is a self-assessment that helps you calibrate areas that may require focus. This can range anywhere from foundational skills (driving, reading, self-defence), and accomplishments, to repressed emotions & traumas. It’s basically you being able to look at your life and think “damn, I worked hard for this”.

Environment is who you & what you’re surrounded by. Family, friends, network, etc., as well as if spending time in nature, or cooped up like a chicken. Environment can make or break any individual which is why it’s important to shape your environment so that it may shape you. 

These three pillars of self-improvement essentially guide you to knowing what to do next."	Fromage_Gustave	reply	na	na	na	0.9982155561447144	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"Ultimately, you have a need to connect to other people, and be *respected*. That's generally difficult in the alienating US society. People try ""hobbies"", but men need common purposeful struggle in order to connect with each other.

Let's say you've got your loneliness covered. (Let aside your romantic pursuits for the moment). What would you like to be doing? What makes sense for you?

Then again, if you hear ""focus on your self"" too much, it might have to do with some things you really need to fix. Social skills is a common issue there."	Fromage_Gustave	reply	na	na	na	0.9982155561447144	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"For me the loneliness always came from a need for validation. I wanted to experience things with others who like the same things or react in similar ways to things so that my feelings and being didn't feel wrong or out of touch. I even moved to a more urban area than I'd ever lived in because I wanted it to be easy for me to get anywhere interesting if I got invited out. But nothing changed, because I didn't change, and frankly, I still struggle with not wanting to leave the house. But I'm pushing myself to be involved in more things for myself. ""Working on yourself"" is an attempt to turn the focus of your need for validation from others, which you can't control, to yourself, which you can. The unfulfilled expectations of validation and companionship are what's killing you. The idea is to start doing things not specifically because you might meet people there, but because you enjoy them and that's good enough. Your expectations change from ""I'm hopefully going to meet someone tonight"" which has a high chance of failure on its own, to ""I'm hoping to have a good time tonight"", which is a much more achievable goal, because it's largely within your control. Even just that is a big step up in mental health from loneliness. And in my personal experience, when you go somewhere just to do something you enjoy, you'll inevitably bump into other people who enjoy those things. And if you're having a good time doing that, and treat people with respect, other people notice. It's no guarantee, there's no formula for how many friends you'll make over the course of a year at a wednesday night bike ride meet up, or Thursday improv shows at the local theater, or whatever your thing is. But the more of them you do, the more people you'll meet, the wider your net, the higher the odds you'll meet someone, friend or otherwise, that you hit it off with. Look for structured activities too. Take a ceramics class that lasts for a few weeks. It's a structured activity that everyone is engaging with simultaneously. Some may have different levels of experience, but it's that difference in experience, and reacting to common stimuli, that gives people something to talk about. Gives complete strangers something in common. 

That's what ""work on yourself"" seems to mean to me, anyway. I'm over 30 and only just starting to click all these pieces together myself. Don't feel bad that you're struggling at 25. Life is a learning curve, nobody's born knowing it all."	Fromage_Gustave	reply	na	na	na	0.9982155561447144	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"Because they know just how fucked up people are, and they want to turn you into a ""productive member of society"" without turning you into a ""psychopath"" or killing you. I don't think it's actually meant to help YOU in particular, it's just meant to keep the wheel turning, the wheel of a society that continues to distance and alienate its members from each other.

I say focus on yourself too honestly, but I say go all the way. There is no ""focus on yourself FOR RIGHT NOW"",  focus on yourself ALWAYS so society won't keep jerking you back and forward to always have you begging for a reprieve from loneliness. Don't go out of your way to treat people badly, and enjoy the people that come your way for as long as they're there, but always live your life as you wish whether there are people there are not.

"Back when humans were evolving, they lived in small tribes, composed of men and women obviously 

Due to the fact women bear children, they became the ones who are protected and provided for - by men 

Over time, men have evolved to have a desire to protect and provide (or simply to simp) for women 

Men have also evolved to have a very strong sexual desire for women, as those who didn't, just didn't pass their genes on.

So in a way, men trade their physical strength 

While this situation favors women, and enables them to live easier and less dangerous lives, the situation between the genders was not as bad because there was no birth control and the tribe was small, women were very reliant on men, so men had leverage, they had something to trade with 

Because essentially men have always trade their skills, their ability to provide for the access to the female body, to her sexuality - which is something the men want very much 

But nowadays, when we live in a society that is nothing like the small tribes the genders evolved in, the situation just becomes terrible for men 

The natural desire men have for women is far stronger than the desire women have for men - where in the past men had valuable assets (physical strength, ability to provide), now they have nothing 

Men have lost all the leverage, while women have kept all the sexual leverage they ever had, if not more so today 

Men are naturally wired to simp and care for women, any women, women are seen and treated better by both men and women, that is a remnant form the time where women were the protected class in the tribe 

We still treat and think of women as the protected class, even tho they now also have access to the traditionally male ways of building worth.

So men are left in the dust, with no natural assets given to them 

Women get their valuable sexuality, while men don't get anything 

Women still get the benefits as if they were the weak protected class, but also get all the other benefits that only men used to have, so now men are left in the dust, they are simply inferior to women 

Women get to be pretty and desirable, but men don't - they never were supposed to, men are supposed to trade protection and providing for access to the female sexuality, the sexuality and the body of the man has no sexual worth 

But in today's world, the neutral ways men used to be equal to women don't work, and instead its all about the value of sexuality/looks 

But men don't get to he desirable like women do, men cannot compete with women in terms of desirability 

TLDR: women are everything men are, but also have the added sexual worth 

Men are forever inferior, because everything they can do, women also can, but women are still part of the valuable, protected part of society and have the additional sexual worth 

So now I'm here, a young male, completely worthless compared to my female counterpart 

My female me would be a part of entirely different social sphere, leagues above me (and her life experience would also reflect that)

"I write this for anyone who needs sympathy because they feel this way.

It really seems like people can be understood to be one of two things. There are those that are treated with dignity, respect, and compassion: the “somebodies”. And, there are people who are laughed at, mocked, and consistently talked down to despite their efforts: the “nobodies”.

Wherever you are in life, be it your job, race, nationality, or otherwise, there are these two. It can’t be denied. If you feel like you are a nobody, I’d like to say that I hope you don’t feel alone. There’s always a nobody that gets stuck in that role because they’re chosen as such, like a scape goat.

To anybody else, please do not argue otherwise or attempt to subvert my sympathies. I’m just trying to let people know they’re not alone. I’m not trying to incite any action, or instigate conflict. I’m just trying to express feelings of respect to the troubles that some people experience.

"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's clear that you have strong feelings for this woman, and it's always tough when those feelings aren't reciprocated. Here are some strategies that might help:  
Accept Your Feelings: It's okay to feel upset, hurt, and disappointed after a rejection. Accepting your feelings is a crucial first step towards healing. It may be helpful to express your feelings in a journal or to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional.  
Cut Contact, If Possible: If you're constantly being reminded of her (through social media, mutual friends, etc.), it might be harder for you to move on. If it's feasible, consider cutting or reducing contact for a while to give yourself some space to heal.  
Focus on Self-Care: This includes eating healthily, getting regular exercise, ensuring you get enough sleep, and doing things that you enjoy. It might be hard to motivate yourself to do these things right now, but they can really help improve your mood and energy levels.  
Distract Yourself: Keeping busy can help take your mind off your feelings. Consider taking up a new hobby, learning a new skill, or volunteering for a cause you care about.  
Meet New People: While you shouldn't rush into a new relationship until you're ready, meeting new people can help broaden your perspective and remind you that there are other potential partners out there.  
Consider Professional Help: If your feelings are causing you significant distress or are interfering with your ability to function normally, consider seeking help from a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or counselor. They can provide strategies and techniques to help you cope with your feelings.  
Finally, remember that it's okay to take time to heal. Everyone moves on at their own pace, and it's normal to still have feelings for someone after two years, especially if your feelings for her were very strong. Be patient with yourself and give yourself the time and space you need to heal."	point_it_out3040	reply	na	na	na	0.005803318694233894	strong	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"Hello, 39 m here.

I stopped dating in 2016 after struggling for years and years.
It all started when a girl I was dating left me but offered to stay friends. I refused, because I had no interest in pursuing that kind of relationship with her, and she went absolutely batshit crazy and started spreading humiliating rumors about me, like I had a small penis, came too quickly, and forced my way with her a number of times.

This completely destroyed my reputation in the small town I live in, and even after moving I started having serious anxiety regarding my body and my performances. I dated for some time after that but intimacy was gradually becoming a painful ordeal, I felt more and more pressure every time I tried to start a new relationship and whatnot. 
Now, I opened up about this with a number of friends over the years, and never, ever received support of any kind. Comments went from “I would be scared too if I had a small pee pee” to “Man up because a woman deserves an assertive man” etc etc.

Went to therapy too, the Leit motive was to accept and embrace who I were, For what I were, and everytime I replied that I had absolutely no issues with who I were, it was other people who did not accept me and shunned me for how I looked. 

Now it’s been like 5 years since last time I dated, and honestly I do not miss it. 
I’m just sad that no one took my suffering seriously enough, because apparently as a man I have no right to complain and be treated fairly, I just have to endure and be stoic.

Sorry for the long rambling, guys.

"Hey man

Reputation destruction is how unstable women attack men. The problem is that there is little you can do against it other than to ""hold your frame"". By this, I mean you need to stand firm and not be affected by anything they say -- ""endure and be stoic"", as you said. 

There isn't much established in society to protect men from crazy women, which is why false rape accusations are so prevalent. Even therapy is geared predominantly towards females and does not deal with how we as men live meaningfully 

On the bright side, you're still young. Even at 39, you've got a lot of time to get things sorted out. Women shouldn't be your priority until you get yourself on-track. 

As a coach the first priority for you would be to get your health & fitness in order first. Build some self-respect by becoming a man who spends his free time building himself up.

"I’ve had women do similar things to me. Even if you’re just a little bit out of line, many women will blow things way out of proportion just to destroy your reputation, because, well, they can (& it’s all they can do anyway). They know that by virtue of them being women, anything you say will amount to horseshit to those she quacked to, because she’s the beautiful, sacred woman, and you’re the disgusting, predatory man. Thank the dark side of the #metoo movement for that one. 

It’s hard and I’m sorry that you’re dealing with this. It is no fucking joke and it’s not as easy as “stop giving a shit what others think.” So much of our sense of well-being comes from the quality of our relationships and if the wrong mouths spout off things about you that either are exaggerated or straight up false, your chances at finding meaningful connection (especially in small circles) are shot.

No one is totally without hope though. You can rebuild and get better. Do what you have to do — only you can know this. I’m only 24 so I don’t think there’s much I can say that you’ll find practical.

This sounds like an issue you have with who you are and what you can do. This is you internalising what *some* people think about you and now placing those pressures on yourself. It's in your head and it's your own enemy now. It's not somebody else saying those things, it's your own brain being a dick to you.

You can't control what others think of you, but you can control how you think of yourself and how much stock you put in what others say. It sucks that there are crappy people out there (women, men, whatever, it could have been anyone), and they can cause harm, but ultimately you gotta work on your own mental health and self-perception. I think your therapists want to give you something you can work on rather than just tell you what you want to hear and make you even more miserable.

It sucks that that happened, but gotta show yourself some love and realise that shitty people or not, you gotta foster and maintain a healthy perception of yourself."	ThrowAway974893839	reply	na	na	na	0.9956628680229187	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
I've spent the past 45 minutes browsing a Twitter thread that was nothing but women humiliating men on instagram dms. Pretty, average, ugly, all types of women with the certainty that they can wipe their soles in our face and we can't do shit about it because we won't ever be as desired as them. Letting yourself be vulnerable the worst way possible just to get punched in the teeth, meanwhile they do whatever the fuck they want because they know they can't be lonely and they'll eventually find someone that fits their type. That's a karma that won't ever be paid, and if my body has intimacy and sex as needs than I'd kill it so it won't force me into play my part in this dehumanizing system.	jaguarcosworthr1	post	28.633569247326907	female	White	0.9993534684181213	na	na	na	20	malementalhealth

Some people there were having a meetup for boards, so I joined them when I couldn't do roleplay. I'm planning to go at least a few times just to make myself familiar and try to make connections.

One issue, however, is that finding topics of interest for conversation is something I struggle with as I tend to think very deeply about niche subjects (folktales, art, history, political economy, etc.) which is probably from undiagnosed autism. I've thought about trying to come up with ""hook"" questions to test the waters and generate interest if they don't know anything about it, but I tend to get caught up in my own head when I should be saying something and end up staying silent.

Feminist messaging: This is more relevant to finding a partner but could apply to friends. I've been conscious of feminism since I was at least in 7th grade since I wrote a paper on it for English class which was favorable towards it (what I can remember from it, the points of the essay were stupid). That was over a decade ago, and I've since rejected it (ironically while taking a women's psych course taught by a feminist professor). 

I never identified as a feminist, but I effectively was one. For most of my life, I wanted to learn everything I can to be a good person and to be considerate of women's perspective and problems. Despite all the messaging of the ideal sort of man feminist women supposedly want, aspiring to those ideals has only left me afraid and alone. I came to realize how contradictory or ambiguous the demands of men were: an emotionally abusive double-bind to push you into submission. I'm too passive and paralyzed from trying to figure out the right thing to do. I tried to do everything right, and, in the end, I was still wrong somehow.

So, I really don't know what to do."	TheWorldUnderHell	post	28.069916716263393	female	White	0.9982428550720215	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth

"As the title says. I am constantly struggling not feeling quite ""man"" enough. I'm on the shorter side, my voice sounds more like a young teen, I put on weight in extremely unflattering ways and when I do manage to thin out I can't build muscle. And of course there are the more ""intimate"" ways I've been forced to confront my inability to measure up, so to speak.

I understand I cannot change these things about myself and I'll never quite like them, but I really need help being able to accept them because as it stands the anxiety and depression over them have become deafening screeches over literally everything I do. I can't effectively work or maintain my household or any kind of relationship because it makes me so miserable.

I've attempted looking for books on BDD since, while I wouldn't quite call it that, the outcomes/effects feel similar, but almost all of them seem focused on eating disorders and especially in women.

"I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but please know that you're not alone. Many people struggle with issues related to body image and self-acceptance. It's important to remember that your worth isn't defined by your physical appearance or societal standards of masculinity. You are more than enough just as you are. Try focusing on the strengths and qualities that make you unique and valuable, beyond just physical traits.  
Seeking professional help could be very beneficial to you. A therapist or counselor who specializes in body image or self-esteem issues could provide valuable insight and coping strategies. Also, consider joining a support group where you can connect with people who are experiencing similar struggles. You don't have to go through this alone. Remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it.

That being said, there is something important you need to recognize. It is not the physical features themselves that bother you, but it is your interpretation of them. In other words, you are suffering your thoughts about the situation. The situation itself is neutral.

"So, here's what's been going on. I'm a 23-year-old guy who's been traveling for work, meeting cool people and forming connections. But there's this one friendship that's got me all sorts of confused, and I need to vent, man.

I joined this company where my cousin used to work, but she got let go. Luckily, I stuck around, and my foreman turned out to be a solid dude. It paid off when they put me in a new project, which was pretty rad.

As time went on, my foreman and I became tight, like real brothers. We hit the gym together, texted all day, and even rode to work side by side. It felt like a true friendship, something special, you know?

But here's where it gets complicated, bro. One day at the gym, he drops this bomb on me: our friendship feels like a relationship without the sex. I was caught off guard, but it made me see our bond in a different light. And let me tell you, it got stronger, real fast. We'd hold hands, just casually, and he would go as far as kissing my hand as a sign of affection. It was intense, man.

Now, here's where things get tricky. We had this wild night when we both got wasted. And i ended up touching each on him. It was like a blur, and he eventually stepped away, making light of it later. I was left feeling all sorts of confused, questioning my own sexuality. Another moment where he flashed his private parts at me and i immediately laughed it off. I feared i would loose him. 

Despite the confusion, we continued like nothing happened. Sharing deep thoughts, him opening up about his life, and moments of affection. But deep down, something felt off. I started getting jealous when he hung out with other dudes, and it really messed with me. Recently, he went back home he is 25M and lives with the mother of his three kids, and mentioned he's planning to propose. And man, it hit me hard.

He reached out to me recently, but I haven't responded yet. I'm torn, bro. Part of me doesn't want to let go, but the other part is scared of where all this leads. I need some guidance, some passion, and someone to talk to.

Thanks for listening, If you've been through anything similar, I'd love to hear your thoughts."	OwlDisastrous6054	post	22.167107960062125	male	White	0.014891021884977818	na	na	na	4	malementalhealth

"I've been through some bromances where I felt a strong brotherly connection and got jealous if he hung out with other guys. I learned that it's best to take a step back. It's good for everyone to have other friends. It never got to kissing, or showing privates, but I've heard that it's not unheard of at high school ages (you guys are quite a bit older, but still). It sounds like a strong friendship where some very mild experimentation occurred.

In some ways it doesn't surprise me that your friend acted this way before thinking of getting engaged. It sounds like you both have some things to figure out, and feelings to reconcile, and I can understand your confusion but I wouldn't dwell on it. Let things go where they go. **Be a good friend and be there for him** even if it's possible the relationship has run its course, it's also possible things will go back to just being an awesome friendship. The upcoming engagement is an unfortunate complicating matter, but you just have to go with the flow and set boundaries when things make you feel uncomfortable.

Note that when you say that the engagement tore you apart, I assume you mean you're worried about the friendship. If it's because you want a relationship with him, you're going to need to add in some distance between you two to work out your feelings, because that is a complicated landmine when he wants to marry this woman after already having 3 kids with her."

Sounds like a heavy situation.   First, and sorry to be abstract, I think we feel more pressure than necessary at times to define relationships.  Sometimes they just are what they are.  What you describe feels like it went beyond friendship but both of you keeping some boundaries to stay consistent with your views of your sexual orientation.  Only my opinion here but if it were me and you are able to move ahead with the friendship while respecting and supporting the direction he is taking his life then do it. If you find it hard to have any relationship with him where he’s with other people then may be best to let him go and move on.

"So here I am- one of many nights where I feel sexually frustrated and horny. I suppose I have my hands and porn, or my hands and my imagination. And maybe I will get the usual from a lot of dudes and beaus: one side will call me out as a lazy fuck who needs to work on self improvement which really just translates to ""go to the gym, freshen up your wardrobe, get offline, go outside and meet people, and find a good stable career"". The problem with these dudes is they don't know anything but Marvel or some other nonsense. Theatre, Shakespeare, Literature, Music, dance, film, sociology, philosophy, history, art- they know nothing. They would be pretty dumb founded if you asked them about any books or authors. Their brains work like a Campbell's soup commercial. A taxidermist couldn't fish out anything of any value. I've seen how stupid and vulgar they often are showing off themselves in mirrors and confabulating on the latest tech- and they will always increase the victimization of any other men with any real challenges by blaming them as being responsible for their victimization. They also use men in subordinative and domineering ways to make themselves feel superior. This often is given off as them trying to be helpful when really they are just patronizing as fuck! So I would rather not even be a fucking dude anymore- maybe become trans not to have to be associated with these worthless men.

Then there are the women out here who are hyper vigilant and on patrol for anyone who might in anyway aggress them and force themselves upon them, or manipulate them. And it can feel like walking on pins and needles and they aren't always clear because simply they don't trust you- and there are some of us who will never earn that trust because... ""you just carry a vibe!"" And to these women I jerking off, looking at porn, and my profile page- I am condemned immediately! No questions, buts, or ifs about it. I am the villain! Don't I know of their free choice and rights?! Don't I know the oppression they have faced for aeons?! Don't I know how common rape and sexual assault is?! I should not act entitled- how dare I! ""YOU ARE AN INCEL!!"" And there are plenty of men who will come loud and proud to this argument, championing it like a white knight. One of these men that I know personally will also lecture me in being a vegetarian because of all the methane produced by cows while he meanwhile pollutes the environment with bit-coin mining!

And all I have said in any of this was about being lonely and sexually frustrated, admitted to porn and jerking off- nothing else- and yeah the porn industry is fucking toxic and there's a history of abuse, violating and exploiting women, and getting them so fucked out of their minds that they would agree to anything on set- and yeah Harvey Weinstein and Hugh Hefner are scum. I agree with everything. I also find that the sexual exploitation simply reversed its direction with Onlyfans and much of the Reddit posers on here exploit lonely and disaffected men emotionally while wrapping it in sugar coated sex. Some content creators don't do this- but most do. The former victimization of women is not rectified by victimizing later the opposing group in which oppressors came from. It doesn't work this way. This is the same thing that happens in other ways too. Most men are NOT Harvey Weinstein's or Jeffrey Epstein's! These are a few successful assholes who acquired their magnificence through exploiting others who worshipped them- and these assholes exist with both dicks and pussies. And yet we as a society continue to worship assholes and when things get too sticky we destroy them and pretend like we weren't to blame and go worship an asshole from another label group. So all men are assholes. Now it's women. Then all women are assholes. Maybe all whites are assholes. Then all blacks. Or all Asians. Or whatever fuck! Assholes exist regardless of gender or race or political affiliation or nationality or religion! 

And I have nothing more to account for than my own actions in this world. I am a white male on the autism spectrum and I may do bad things because of my ""privilege"" but I also may do bad things because of media exposure and me being on the spectrum? But I am only responsible for my actions in as much as I can and have been aware of what I do. I cannot be accountable for people prior to me who passed on their genes to me and I can only be but so accountable to ignorance when in this world people mostly choose to fight and not explain things- not have any kind of patience because you set off a trigger, and because with all this stupid tech there is a pollution of pseudo- info and each person seems to live in their own bubble of knowledge like MGS2 forecasted. 

So I look at all this and look at the toxic men and toxic women I meet regularly- men who gaslight me,  dehumanize me, and are totally vapid and condescend me; and I look at women who are hyper vigilant, flaky, unapproachable, have double meanings, unpredictable, insecure, angry, dog worshipping, psychologically baggage dumping, emotionally fake, noncommittal, aggressively interested then not, operating as a surrogate persona of their former ex to which they are bound, or addicted to attention- and I don't want any of it. I'd rather just be acknowledged and engaged with as a person a priori!!!! I am a person fundamentally before my gender! Do I have to become trans just not to deal with all the garbage of both men and women.

Why do so many men seem to gravitate to me as we have something in common as both being losers in the gender wars and being sexually frustrated?! All else doesn't exist. I mean I get the frustration and depression- but I am so much more than this as a person- and to be seen either by men or women as I am often seen reduces and dehumanizes me on some level I feel. I never make any magical memories with my co-depairers or those who see me as the potential target to lash out against. It's always purely about them and I am part of the stage set of their play. So yeah it really is best to find someone who is trans- but then I have to be careful with a lot of trans to female because too many try to mimic the toxicity of women. But men who trans to women usually do not mimic male toxicity I have noticed. I can have a emotionally mature bond without the domination and stupid cultural crap.

Maybe I am all off on everything I am saying here. But I am writing how I see it and what I have been exposed to. I am also suffering from severe disassociation, trauma and shut down most of the time and feel like all the people who try to connect with me- both men and women are just going to dump me without second thought- use and dump me. I make a great deal of effort to connect and process various people and understand them. Often it exhausts me with how much they wish to share and all these words and concepts I can barely connect with and videos they send- and I have to reread many times and feel so dumb. I don't mind this too much- but what I do mind is that this person will go through all of this just to forget about me and move on sometime this or the next month, or week! I know it's a big thing to say- but it feels like a form of emotional rape. And both men and women do this crap.

So the trauma and disassociation I referred to above probably has a lot to do with all the abandonment and neglect I've known since birth pretty much which really makes it hard for me to get invested or care about gender, race, conservatism or Liberalism, or any of the issues current today. I have always felt left out, excluded, and marginalized. I don't know what a partner looks like- but also not what friends or family looks like! Hell, I don't know what love and care looks like because those who were most often the most eager to give out hugs and warm words were the freshest to leave without any explanation or thought. This is not far from being different than a lady who has had a one night stand and feels dirty afterwards because there was never any love and she was just used. At least she might have some family and/or friends to return home to. This has not been true for me.

I couldn't even cry when the one person who did really care and stay was killed by the police- Jasper Aaron Lynch. I couldn't cry because of how surreal it felt just to have had your deepest bond be someone you knew mostly digitally and saw in life only three times- and this best friend who called you his best had the photos to remember things with with other people- not with you. 

So what does love mean? please I need to know this. And don't lecture me about porn because I hate it too- but I also realize that even the die hard porn hater who is a straight as the cross conservative Christian watches YouTube and frequents Disney films- and these things are all family with porn

See porn is not just bad because of the toxicity regarding sex to both men and women- but it's even more fundamentally bad in how it reduces the social habitat of being human and gives a mere approximation- a toxic one to a human's needs- and frankly all social media and the entertainment industry is built on this- pipe dreams in the ass of everyone who will take a seat!

It's all parasocial engagement. the people do not care about you and it takes a part of life- a part that should be there to live!- and caramelizes it to get you addicted: You watch great sex instead of having real sex yourself with someone you care about and want to be intimate with and stay with- a person you wake up to and feel fuzzy and warm with; you watch a Disney movie where characters seem to be spontaneous and invite fun into their daily lives because you are too pencil screwed to ever make light of things and co-create with another, you are adulting; you watch content creators on YouTube and read blogs to engage intellectually because you can't ever have intellectually deep conversations with any of your teachers, who teach thousands of students and don't care about you, or your friends who are too busy and just want to have a good time.

Frankly the people who create your intelligence and amusement are of the same breed who give rise to your libido- none of these people exist! They are golden calves of one form of idolatry or another!

I just don't know how to survive anymore with all this. I can't seem to find anyone- and if I do it is again online which is by its nature non-committal.  I can't care about the gender wars when I find myself thrown into the fray because of hormones and intimacy frustration when the human race has really not included me. Your concerns are not even real because I have lived an entirety of life being unreal and disposable. I don't know what anything really means anymore including someone who wants me to become a Christian because I was left behind. I don't know if ultimately everything is just reducible to a machine and everything is constructed off of simply hurting each and everything- and we are both so complicated and so stupid to point the finger everywhere but ourselves and label ""the other"" as the group doing the hurting."

"tldr or smthg : scared i might have tbi/brain damage due to concussive state in year 9, minor incidents in year 5 and year 10. high results all round, never really study too much.

&#x200B;

**Experiences**

When I was in YEar 2 - Year 4 I was very bright, smart child and commended by my parents, teachers and other specialists. In year 5, I got in a fight and someone hit me in the back of the head with small fists around the back of my head (the area where hair usually ends after a fresh cut), and the area had swollen parts to it for a while that hurt to touch. I don't remember having bad symptoms or any head aches necessarily, but remember crying and having enough capacity to tell teacher and stuff. 

After than incident I have done still really well in schooling with scholarships everything etc and NAPLAN up until Year 9, where I fell hitting the topish of my head, I think i got a minor concussion as my walking was very fuzzy and weak, I still remember everything that happened clearly on that day and even remarking to my friend about it, also I had bad headache that day that went away. stupidly, i didn't tell others in my recollection and didnt get help, just slept it out.  After that incident, I still did very well in school, but had a study slump where I had bad mental health etc that could've impacted it but i thugged it out, and got really high grades that matched my previous performance and even better in the circumstances. 

Fast forward to Year 10, my brow bone where my eyebrows are got hit by cricket ball with helment, that didn't do anything as it hit up rather than straight at my head, and this unlucky happened 6 times over two months, but it definitely wasn't forceful hits just stung. The last two hits led me to feel little tired but nothing out the normal, i definitely think that it was just my mind making it up as i was worried about it.  

Tbh after these incidents my year 10 is of to very strong start with math and science, so idk.

**Reaasoning**

TO these events, Im scared something could've impacted my intelligence and cognitive ability. reasonig for this is that i feel my memory decreased, it could be attributed to my constant fatigue sometimes, mental health sadness and that i've stopped reading. 

Also, i don't have proper reasoning for my iq reducing as my scores are high and my school results are constantly competitive with top 3 at shcool but i did completely flunk NAPLAN which i didn't try and was late to as I got high Band 9 for math, and some band 10s for english when in year 5 i got decently higher (yr 7 skipped due to covid). However, like im not sure with my worry and anxiety over this i started picking up when I forget things, and its worrying.
.

&#x200B;

**Background context etc**

Ive done IQ tests including Italian one that had large sample data, MENSA norway i think and the psychometrics test by WASIQ i think it was, and I got 133, 118 (very tired on that day and distracted and under stress pressure), 135 respectively. Im not sure if it really has been impacted however.

For some reason, in maths I always find myself performing bad on NAPALN and stuff as such for some reason but do very very well in other tests with minimal practice.

I procrastinate a lot in my studies but still manage to memorise when it matters and do pretty welll (A - A+), sometimes i start studying 5 days into a two topic test for example.

I struggle with mental health, dont have any bad thoughts but when i do it means i get brain fog and just fatigue with the sadness.

Im 15, year 10.

I have a lot of test anxiety and make silly mistakes that take away marks and never that I don;t understand a topic in tests.

"I studied in a top school in the UK. My track record academically, extracurricularly, and socially was near flawless. I scored amongst the top in my peers. Life was improving and going great.

A girl I had sex with accused me of rape. She claimed that she could not remember anything. It was my first few nights at university and she brought me to her room. She had the ability of bringing me to her room (walking). 

The police took a look at the CCTV Clips in my police interview and laughed it off. I was let off with no further action the next day.

In pertinence to the woke MeToo Movement throughout the western world, the university conducted its own investigations. She got her friends/witnesses to claim that she was very drunk. The university stated that her loss of memory was sufficient to show that she did not have the capacity to consent. I was shortly expelled afterwards. Nothing against feminism that I hold. I am just baffled by the abuse by some individuals to destroy the lives of others.

In just this, my whole world turned inside out. The scores, the scholarship, the friend group I created here, the internship…. All seem shaky. Just a few months back they were all rock-solid. The biggest L of my life has engulfed me. I feel like I am entrapped in a gulley of darkness. As a masculine man, I understand that nobody will allow me to continue if I give up on myself. I have decided to share my story here, as a testament to myself to make sure that I continue.

"For my PhD research, I am studying a topic that is close to my heart, as I am sure it is to many of you.

Men's mental health is often neglected through the lack of recognition and support available when things get tough. I want to contribute to the creation and development of interventions that will ultimately change the lives of men across the world.

My research looks at how men help-seek. There are two facets to this: how men with anxiety help-seek, and how men help-seek across generations. I want to look into whether there are specific notions of anxiety which aid or hinder men in asking for help, likewise with age and its effect on help-seeking for anxiety.

"Missing response from ""barriers to seeking help"": people in the past have **not listened** or **dismissed my feelings** when I sought help. This is in particular true of anxiety, your focus- if you tell someone you're anxious about something, they just tell you to stop being anxious about it. It's automatic and superficial. ""Don't worry, it'll be fine, there's nothing to be concerned about."" If the answer is always the same, it teaches people to stop asking because others don't understand or believe you. Even if you go to a professional, it's dominated by CBT. You're just thinking wrong. Just stop thinking that wrong thing. Or maybe you just need a pill to fix your malfunctioning brain. It's never treated as a real or valid feeling worth space or speech or having a context and cause like everything else does. It's, ""your feeling is uncomfortable to me, why can't you just not have it?""

The fundamental assumption in most of your questions seems to be that I *haven't sought help* in the 35 years I've been alive. And further, that there is something *wrong with men* that makes us *refuse* help. That's a common theme in the conversation about men's mental health. Maybe you should participate more in that conversation before trying to contribute to it, Kayleigh. Men ARE asking for help. We're screaming for it. People aren't listening to us and we're dying because of it."	malehelpseeking	reply	na	na	na	0.0017431711312383413	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"Just filled it out, it seems good! There’s just a few small things I’d like to comment on. (I said small but this ended up being super duper long, sorry.) 

As a gender studies major, I feel obligated to point out gender studies 101: sex and gender are not the same. “Male” and “man” are not necessarily the same, and “female” and “woman” are not necessarily the same. I found the gender selection options to be lacking due to that, especially considering how different one’s childhood can be if they’re trans or gender nonconforming. I personally am male and genderfluid, but I selected the “male” option because that was what I felt was best. Obviously because this focuses on men, other gender options aren’t necessarily needed, but they could possibly be included for trans people, gender nonconforming folks, etc. 

I must also state that as a man who has mental health issues, and is involved in gender related fields, I am very grateful that you’re doing this study. Something I’ve noticed from other men I’ve talked to is that a lot of men don’t necessarily have difficulty asking for help. The difficulty comes from not being listen to. *People don’t care about our mental health.* We are not listened to when we do ask for help. 

I was very lucky to grow up in a progressive family where I was not ridiculed for asking for professional help. However, despite my upbringing I still have internalized a lot of toxic stuff in relation to my mental health, which made me hesitant to go to therapy. Unfortunately a lot of the therapists I’ve encountered don’t have the resources or training to help. I have severe depression and anxiety, and the affordable help I found couldn’t actually help that much. 

This brings me to two  issues with accessing professional help. Firstly, like I said, a lot of professionals don’t have the time or resources for us. Secondly is toxic masculinity combined with poor mental health, which led me to feel like a burden for wanting and needing help. My depression made/makes me hopeless, and that combination of feeling like a burden for needing help, feeling stupid for asking for it, and feeling hopeless about my situation made me start therapy years after I should have. 

Lastly is queerness. Me being a member of the LGBTQIA+ community is a significant part of my anxiety and depression. (Interacting with heterosexual cisgender men definitely ramps up my anxiety, sorry lads.) Considering men who are members of oppressed groups are more likely to not have access to healthcare, the gender studies major in me urges you to look into intersectionality, and how identify affects access to healthcare. 

Sorry that that was so long, I really wasn’t expecting to write that much. I hope it’s helpful! Also, feel free to DM me if you want to talk any more! Good luck with your research! <3"	malehelpseeking	reply	na	na	na	0.0017431711312383413	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

Then on the other hand I have a mentally ill brother who is ruining my family, gets into trouble with police, doesn’t obey any rules at home. We tried to get him the help he needs but Canada doesn’t seem to help with mental health. He’s on medication but it does nothing, we tried everything for him. He doesn’t want to change. Then I have my career issue, ever since I graduated high school I’ve been trying to find a job in the skilled trades but don’t have any luck, they just hire experienced people. I basically have nothing to look forward too, my life is miserable and sad I can’t do this any longer. My only way to escape reality is playing video games, which only temporarily fixes my problems.

"this is an interesting question

i think you need to be realistic when you're being goal focused and when you're being path focused. a lot of it is duration; the longer it takes, the less a goal is going to motivate you, so the more you should be motivated by the labor itself. conversely, it's okay to be goal motivated if the goals are renewable, easily and consistently attained

i think it's difficult to have a concrete answer. you have to think about what matters to you; at the end of the day, what sort of life do you want to have lived? how much are you willing to endure for the things you want?

i think of the example between a friend of mine and me. he's in finance, works 60-80 hour weeks, even up and moved countries completely, all in the service of suffering now to retire early (probably when he's 40, so about ten more years) 

on the other hand, i don't make nearly as much money, but my hours are much more reasonable too (30-40, i set a lot of my own hours). i don't want to work my life away, i want to balance it so i can do things with my life while i'm working
but it means i'll probably be working longer (until i'm 50-60 probably, so 20-30 more years) 

obviously, retiring in general is a lofty ideal nowadays... but the concepts are what matters here. our differences are because we have different goals and different things we tolerate in life

"Your mistake is in thinking happiness must be ""deserved.""  
that is incorrect. What you are talking about is fulfilment. Happiness is a choice. Like Perrito from Puss in Boots. It's a decision. And not an easy one.   


For mental health in the modern age I have found dopamine to be a huge problem. Instant dopamine from the phione has ruined our systems.

  
**I would seriously suggest starting a garden.** 

&#x200B;

The effects of caring for something long term and seeing the results of that (such as building something, or painting something. In this case, growing something) are actually really profound. It's helps to reconnect your slow drip dopamine ---that is, the reward for ACTUALLY doing something physical (like, say, working in the garden) and will help readjust the feelings.  


Purpose and meaning in life is CHOSEN. Not given. Not passed on. You CHOOSE what your life is going to be and then you make it that.   


Constantly mess things up? Everyone else does to. Fail Forward. IF you fall, fall on your face. Because at least then you are a little bit further than you were. Life is going to knock you down. Constantly. Every time you think stuff is going swell, life will come in with a haymaker to rock your world.  


Life comes in waves. Crests and troughs. You have to commit to a slow product if you want to see a lasting wave crest. Something you can slowly work on over time and see the results build on themselves. A garden is perfect for this. (Also working with dirt has some weird connection with beneficial bacteria and brain health.

It is not, but taking steps to cope with it is. You can get therapy, medication, exercise, good food and slowly dig yourself out of this hole. It is really hard to do it because depression takes away motivation, self- esteem, mental and physical strength. What makes you so special that out of all people do not deserve good things to happen to you? Will you apply the same judgment to a stranger that you knew was suffering from depression? It is ok to not be ok, to struggle as long as you do not intentionally hurt others. Give yourself a break, man and take it slow. You just have to start somewhere and keep trying, get treatment and don't give up on yourself. It is painful to look back and mourn things that you might have had if your life was not thrown off of the rails by depression, but at least as it cannot get any worse, there is nothing to be afraid of.	point_it_out3040	reply	na	na	na	0.9994055032730103	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
People are lame.  You deserve to be whatever you want.  Drown out the static and the toxic.  When we let other people decide our worth that's when shit goes downhill.  You have to stop giving a shit about what people think and I really mean this.  It's the only way to heal. That and doing a lot of breathing, meditating, and doing things to distract your mind and distance yourself from toxic thinking.  Exercise helps a lot as does spending 10-20 minutes each day doing a very calm activity in a quiet place.  Sometimes I'll light a candle and sit in the couch and just turn on the TV on really low and just breathe and try to let the energy go away.  You can often feel it in your muscles.  Try to sort of givevup control.  I find more often than not I am in am incredibly tense state.  I need to let this get out of me or I get depressed.

"These without doubt at these biggest factors when it comes down to regulating my own behaviour. I say this as a coach and biohacker who has delved into the depths of self-improvement over the past 7 years. 

1. **Sunlight** 

Without a doubt, this is the biggest factor I have come across, and this is coming from someone who trains hard, eats clean, has worked through tough goals, etc..

If I do not get enough sunlight, I feel anxious & depressed, regardless of how much else is in check. 

Now this can be an issue if you live in a colder climate such as the UK, but I found the answers.

First - supplementing vitamin D3 (with K2), while is important, doesn't take away the requirement for UV light. For years on end I would go into deep depressions during the colder months, even while taking large dosages of D3 with K2.

I didn't appreciate the importance of UV rays until starting combining tanning beds twice weekly during the winter. This made ALL the difference, and is noticeable immediately. Colours become bright & vivid again while an energy.

Now first, I am not recommending tanning beds unless absolutely necessary. Over-exposure to their extreme UVs can cause burns and even cancer. It takes roughly 4 minutes for the body to start converting cholecalciferol into its active form that can be used by the body. 6 minutes twice a week is more than enough.

Natural sunlight is the best form of light you can possibly have. Society has fear-mongered us into thinking that the Sun is bad for us and that we should layer up with toxic sun-blocks. Instead, we should focus on being outdoors for a reasonable amount of time e.g. 30 minute, and getting our bodies used to sunlight exposure.

Without doubt, discovering the improvements in mental health & anxiety from sunlight will be an absolute game-changer.

2. **Circadian rhythm** 

This is your body clock and has a massive impact on your productivity and ability to focus. If you're sleep & waking up times are inconsistent, your body becomes confused and hormones fly all over the place. 

There's a reason night-owls are far more likely to suffer from depression, while night work is referred to as the ""graveyard shift"". 

You need to be getting 7-8 hours of sleep, but more importantly: waking up at the same time every day. I really cannot stress how much this will set the foundation of your day. Even oversleeping by an hour can leave you foggy-minded and feeling weird.

As soon as you wake, make it your task to get sunlight ASAP. Even if it's through the clouds, 5-10 minutes of direct daylight will kickstart your circadian rhythm that will prime your body to function properly throughout the day. 

Do NOT check your phone before doing this. It will scramble your dopamine and leave you unable to focus properly. 

These two are without doubt essential to your well-being, and I say this because you could have everything else on point, but if either of these two are not on track, you will still function poorly. 

Both cost nothing to fix.

"Hello everyone! As someone who has always been interested in the science behind human behavior and the mind, I was excited to discover this community. I have been reading through some of the posts and discussions and found them both insightful and thought-provoking. I thought I would share my own story and experiences with psychology and see if anyone else has had similar experiences.

Growing up, I was always fascinated by how people acted and thought. I was constantly observing those around me and trying to understand why they did what they did. As I got older, I became more and more interested in the science behind it all. I wanted to understand the mechanisms behind human behavior and its reasons.

&#x200B;

I ended up going to college and majoring in psychology. I loved every minute of it. I was wholly engrossed in my classes and eager to learn as much as possible. I ended up doing some research with one of my professors, studying the effects of stress on memory recall. It was an incredible experience, and I learned so much.

&#x200B;

One of the most interesting cases I have encountered in my work was a [pathological liar](https://fherehab.com/learning/pathological-lying-disorders) patient. They had been lying for so long that it had become a part of their identity, and they couldn't seem to stop. Through therapy, we could identify the underlying issues that were driving the lying behavior and work on developing more honest and authentic communication. It was challenging, but seeing the patient progress was incredibly rewarding.

&#x200B;

After college, I got a job in a hospital, working with patients who had suffered traumatic brain injuries. It was an incredibly challenging job, but it was also enriching. I could use the knowledge I had gained in college to help these patients authentically. It was amazing to see their progress over time and to know that I had played a part in that progress.

&#x200B;

Now, I am working on my master's degree in psychology, focusing on clinical psychology. I hope to eventually become a licensed therapist and work with patients who have mental health issues. I believe that psychology is such an important field, and I am honored to be a part of it.

&#x200B;

I would love to hear from others who are also interested in psychology. What drew you to this field? What experiences have you had that have shaped your interest in psychology?

Many people are drawn to psychology because they want to better understand themselves and others, as you mentioned.

"In my mind, there is absolutely zero reason to date a male virgin and/or a man with zero relationship experience, unless it’s some kind of fetish. Relationships require a certain kind of maturity and discipline that you can’t just develop without, and your first relationships are supposed to act as learning experiences for you to develop yourself further. Most people get that stuff over with while they are teenagers in high school, and by the time they reach college already have a solid foundation of experience to go from. Being an older virgin with no experience is a total “boner” killer to most people, because no one wants to deal with a grown adult who has absolutely no experience with dating and literally doesn’t know how to be in a relationship because they didn’t date as teenagers like **everyone else**. You’d have to be unbelievably patient and understand to ever take on a virgin because you are basically teaching them step by step on how to be a good partner. Why bother with that? What woman with likely lots of experience would want to deal with a 22 year old autist who has never had a relationship before in his life when they can get a neurotypical guy who is probably just as kind, good and interesting who’s also experienced? The few people who would do that are the exception, not the rule. The overwhelming majority view being inexperienced romantically and sexually as a huge red flag, and most can very easily detect it at some point and they will more than likely ditch you for someone experienced. If you missed out on dating and first times in high school or in your very early 20’s, your potential to find a relationship plummets drastically and you can kiss the idea of casual sex goodbye imo. 

There are teenagers several years younger than me who have far more romantic and sexual experience than me. No amount of self improvement can ever truly compare to someone who has built themselves up and experienced life naturally simply by being themselves. No matter how many times I genuinely push myself to be more social with my coworkers or go to therapy or attend whichever group I may just do that I can improve myself socially, there will always be a guy my age or younger who did all that naturally that can charm away anyone away from the loser who has to attend clubs just to talk to people because he has no social circle because he is an autistic loser. They will always have an advantage over me and will always have more success and potential than me. What I will have probably worked tirelessly for years past my prime they will have experienced when they were 18 effortlessly, and have an entire life of success and experience to attract everyone. As an autistic shut in, I will simply never compare to or be as great as these guys who will charm away any partner who doesn’t want to deal with inexperienced loser. It is 100% abnormal and unattractive af to be a virgin at 22."	Western_Quantity_103	post	27.06125444657679	male	White	0.9987741112709045	na	na	na	14	malementalhealth

You’re fine dawg. 22 is so far from hopeless. Your brain is still developing and likely your body still is as well. I couldn’t grow decent facial hair until 24 and it’s still filling out at 25. 

By working out and living healthy and reading about new things and leaning into my autistic tendencies I’ve become a conventionally attractive, intelligent, and genuine young man. I am having so much more success dating now at 25 then ever before in my life. I was a virgin all through highschool and yes my first few times dating were awkward and I lost a lot of girl’s interest with my awkward tendencies. But you get more practice and you get better and more relaxed and things come for naturally for you

"You sound a lot like me.  I'm 35 and have similar issues.  Inevitably it will be more difficult for us. I think it's going to be important to not be too picky in who you choose.  Pick someone for their personality and really ignore how they look.  I know this sounds really counter intuitive but you really need a person who is going to give you the time of day and the better looking the person is the more likely they are going to run away and look for someone else.  I know this sounds incredibly shallow but you just need a person who will accept you the way you are and a very hot woman is going to probably just want to find a hot guy with a high body count.  What you really want and need is the opportunity to be with a person however you can get it it's important.  But it will involve getting over looking hard for physical attraction and looking deeper into that person being there for you.  You want a reliable partner one who has had a similarly difficult time finding someone.  You will be able to relate to each other's struggles and it will grow from there.  Expect this to take time and years of trying, failing and learning. You will feel like trash.  It's ok. Shake it off try again keep your head up.  If you just want sex yeah consider a sex worker they can happily help you out.  It's legal in some places.  But I think what you really want is something etching solid and long lasting.  Work on making yourself as attractive as possible.  Spend time going to the gym, get your body in great shape so when people look at you they think ""damn that guy looks like he is in awesome shape and Iove his clothing"".  Do social things as much as they are painful just push yourself.  Again it will be uncomfortable it will be painful.  But you are learning.

"It’s not that deep and you overvalue sex and relationships but I can tell your desperate for a win and I don’t blame you given how society puts them on pillars. I don’t say these things to hurt you but to hopefully help. 

A couple red flags I’m seeing are
- you assume you know women before connecting with them
- you comparing yourself to others
- a why bother mentality

I’ve been in a long term and several short term relationships but even then I still compare myself to ripped tanned Greek gods from time to time I’ve been working to catch the thought throw it in the trash, reminding myself of my worth. Body count is almost like money and success, someone’s always going to have more and better and some don’t have to work for it at all. Sucks but it’s reality, does that mean it’s hopeless? Nope, highlight your strengths, continue to improve yourself, grind it out.  

Relationships more often than not come from friendship, if you have a hard time making friends I suggest taking a big step back and doing that, a relationship is a spicy friendship. You’re just two people who enjoy each others company, so much your borderline inseparable. I swear it’s not that deep, everything about a relationship that stresses you out is stuff you’ll pick up quickly without thinking too hard as the relationship progresses HOWEVER, if your stubborn and drag your feet through moments of growth you’ll end up back here again. Self awareness and accountability will be major contributing factors towards the success of your first relationship. 

Also something really funny is how you say that “no amount of self improvement can truly compare to someone who has built themselves up and experienced life naturally by being themselves”

Self improvement comes bundled with learning to just be yourself, love yourself etc. if you are not doing the ladder start there that’s not something you can’t do. If your living with mask on 100% of the time, time to take it off. Learn to accept yourself.

Also also, one women I was with had several long term relationships and a body count of 30 to my one “sort of hookup”. During that relationship I was shocked at how mentally mature I was countless times, she was sexually experienced but when it came to real stuff the sit down and grow moments I couldn’t believe what I was hearing half the time.

Nothing is set, you can have a million relationship and have no idea how to convey your thoughts and emotions properly. 

Everyone works on different things all the time, you’ll always be working. Have a goal that isn’t a relationship for the time being but stay social, learn to accept yourself and enjoy outings with friends.

"I have ADHD and was pretty isolated and over protected as a kid and had few friends so my social skills were shit and my parents were a mess.

Safe to say I was *not* among the popular crowd but one of the nerd outcasts. So, I didn't date in high school. I dated a few women very briefly in college. A few dates but no relationship for the next several years. I didn't have any kind of intimate experience until my late 20s.

"I hope this helps in someway. Don't think of yourself like that. I know it's easier said than done. We as people become and start to act what we see ourselves as. We limit or push ourselves to become what we think we are or what we are trying to achieve.

You are putting yourself out there which many people cannot say they have done. That's pretty badass. You are pushing yourself. Most people in life don't do that, they get comfortable and complacent.

People who say you NEED to find your passion are insistent, but it's rare that people ever develop one. People advocating for finding it are just trying to raise your quality of life because the people that turn their passion into careers are supposed to be 'fulfilled' while the rest of us work soul-crushing jobs then chase distractions and quick highs. Give yourself credit, you have work, you make an effort to meet new people and have some friends. I know it's easy to dwell in self-pity but recognize that we are all in this journey together.

"I am 30 now and now I have to accept that I am absolutely not who I thought I was. I have had anxiety and mood and temper issues since I was 11 due to traumatic events and I basically was too anxious to live my life. The funny thing is that I was an excellent student at high school and and also I was admitted to any uni I wanted to go to. But in retrospect, there were plenty of red flags. I spent most of my time at home, alone, I didn't really hang out, I was frustrated, I acted myself all the time and I in more than one way I was childish. Then my life seems to have stopped after HS and I went from therapy to therapy and didn't grow emotionally independent from my parents.

I cannot process the fact that I am 30 now and this is what I have become. Things happened so fast after I turned about 25. No more chance to get the undergrad experience, no first loves, no growing up together and exploring ourselves and the world as we turn into full-grown adults; no studying hard, competing, excelling and figuring out what I am the best at and getting academic support and kickstart my career. My CV is empty, the things I wanted to experience never happened, because I kept putting them off until they were no longer available. I always thought I'd need time but eventually I would find my inner strength and make up lost time.

I know for a fact that from now on life will pass very quickly: [https://maximiliankiener.com/digitalprojects/time/](https://maximiliankiener.com/digitalprojects/time/)

I am just terrified by this. It's like it is over already. I live in the past and time is flying already and things will mostly not change because my personality is solidified by now and I hate some things about myself.

Life is so cruel. You have til about your late twenties to establish your path, and if you don't, you will have to race against time to figure things out and get your life together as quickly as possible, because your 30s and 40s will be over in a blink of an eye, you will have to earn money, raise kids, etc. I might be wrong, but the way I see it, if you don't keep to your schedule, you will be in big trouble. If you don't have a family, you will be alone in the second half of your life. If you don't find your way to financial stability, you will spend your precious years making ends meet.

Am I right about this? I want to be a completely different person. But instead of becoming more simple, life is getting more complicated. I am changing for the worse and I have more and more issues and life is too short to figure everything out."

"Anxiety isn't a joke. Worrying is a waste of time but it's not easy to just stop worrying. You have to convince your subconscious and also have the biological capacity to feel calm.

That year thing is an exaggeration to convince people to stop putting life on snooze and to start focusing on using your time wisely.

Yes when your 30 you have less options because almost everyone by now is already in a relationship our has kids but at the same time people have ended there relationships our have stayed single like you so there is a chance to be in a relationship as for the financial thing goes you be surprised how many people are poor when there 30 but more well of when there older.

"there is no age limit for finding your way. people restart their lives all the time in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and later. hell, speaking as a trans person, some people don't even figure their *gender* out until they're twice our (i am also 30) age

that theory, btw, completely ignores brain development. it assumes that the perception of time is static, and personally, i think it's a bit silly to think infants, children, teenagers, and adults perceive time the same

also, i think it's quite noteworthy that the rapid passage of time in that little app stops as soon as you stop scrolling. i feel that life is not so different

there is something to be said for the effects of trauma on how one perceives time. trauma has a way of freezing our perception of time, making it feel like emotions will never end in the moment; and numbing us to the passage of our own lives

if you want to have a life well lived, i really believe you have to focus on the present, not the future. think about where you want to be, yes; but when you decide, focus on walking the path, not whether or not you'll end up where you want. life is like a winding road full of flowers that are worth stopping to take in; and by and large, walking the path is the only thing you need to do to find yourself where you want to be

dog piling on yourself is only hurting you. it's true you've lost some time, but you can only change the path in front of you. forgive your past self with compassion and kindness, and do your best for your future self. these are the two selves that you should treat as your best friends

take up breathing exercises and mindfulness - meditation is an excellent way to improve your perception of time. the breathing exercises will help you regulate the anxiety eating you up.

learn about trauma, find trauma informed doctors or therapists. go outside, take walks, appreciate whatever beauty you can find

life is not easy, but it's doable. there is value in having lived just for the sake of doing so

I always that I was kind of contributing to my happiness when seeing anime characters achieving their purpose and saving lives.

I always wanted to be a protagonist without doing any effort and creating illusions in my mind.

But I realized how badly it affected my mental health to always see them succeed in their conquests.

Because at the end of the day…

I just spend my days watching them and not moving a single finger from my bed.

Which as a result only made me hate myself ,live in a whole different a world so that I run away from my real life problems instead of facing them like I should do.

This might be a hot take but I don’t know if a man’s mental health matters so as long as he can keep moving forward. For me being a man means taking care of your family and bearing the burdens so that your family doesn’t have to.

Mental health affects all of us, regardless of gender. Ignoring or dismissing men's mental health concerns not only perpetuates harmful stereotypes and stigmas, but it also puts men at risk for serious health consequences.

Research has shown that men are less likely than women to seek help for mental health concerns, which can lead to higher rates of suicide and other mental health issues. This is particularly concerning given that men are often socialized to be stoic and self-reliant, making it even harder for them to ask for help when they need it."

I've made so many dumb mistakes over the years, effed up multiple relationships, and just haven't accomplished anything with my life. I've considered suicide, but won't for the sake of my boys. I feel like I keep trying to find acceptance and love from outside sources (friends, family, bosses, drugs, alcohol) and don't know how to just love me for who I am because I don't like me, I can't stand who I am and I don't even know where to start to fix it.

Focus only on what you can control. What helped me was making a selfcare/ to do list everyday. I wrote down everything I wanted my best ideal self to do from brushing teeth, exercising, working, even fun things like enjoying any hobby I have or even want to have. Then I attack that list with every fiber of my being. It’s helped me a lot. It’s hard to remember sometimes you have to chose what to focus on you can chose what to put your energy in. You aren’t required to think about some things. If you can’t fix it now fix what you can and sooner or later you’ll be in a spot to fix the harder stuff. Don’t forget to take time to relax and enjoy life. Sounds like you’re putting effort into how you think and that’s a good start. If you notice you’re beating yourself up over something or worrying about things remind yourself you can control to an extent what you think about the more you practice the easier it will get. Hope any of that was helpful. I’m not the best at communicating but for the first time in my life I have self worth and man everyone deserves to be someone they love. You are worth the effort and work it’s going to take our habits make or break us but I’ve never been more at peace with life and death and everything since I’ve become someone I can have a little empathy and love for.

"I'm going to be honest I plugged this into AI but it's good advice:

I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a difficult time at school. It's important to remember that you are not alone and that what you're experiencing is not your fault. It's also important to understand that you have options and resources available to you.

Firstly, it might be helpful to talk to a trusted friend, family member, or teacher about what you're going through. Having someone to confide in can provide emotional support and help you feel less alone.

Additionally, it might be helpful to speak to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with coping strategies and support to manage your feelings of sadness and overwhelm.

It's also important to take care of yourself physically. Engaging in regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep can all help to improve your mood and overall well-being.

Lastly, remember that your worth is not defined by what others say or think about you. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and it's important to surround yourself with people who uplift and support you.

Making fun of others makes them feel better about themselves.

"So first off, I know I’m attractive. I’m not ripped but I’m well toned and have a good face and body. I even hear I look like Elvis. Women do find me attractive. However, my problem is that women as a whole don’t value physicality as much as men, or as much as I want it to be appreciated or celebrated. 

For example, I want to use sexy pics for my dating profiles in the same manner as a woman, but I know that unless it’s done differently, very very tastefully, or nonchalantly, women don’t usually like it. I also want to post pics like that on social media, but I know to most people it comes off as douchey or cringy. I don’t see why. I’m not a douche, I simply value expression and celebration of one’s body for all people. I both want to promote body positivity and love myself. I’m not trying to be weird

It’s a little offensive, if I do something that women do all the time and people like it’s seen as weird.

I know there are other things to love about me. I’m pretty smart, I try to be nice, people respond well to being around me so I think I have a good personality, but I know these things and I dont want to just be them. I don’t just want to be loved and respected, I want to be physically lusted over.

This is my question: Where can I find an outlet for expressing myself this way? Are there places I would be valued mainly for my physicality?

I want to try modeling and I have been told by many people I could. I know that I still won’t be looked at the way I want to be- like a woman is. Is this a good idea? What else can I do?

For a long time I didn't go to the cinema on my own because I thought people would judge me. All that meant was that I missed out on seeing some great films in the cinema.

And fuck traditional gender roles - I grow my hair long and wear jewellery because I want to and, back in the day, a lot of strangers struggled with it (mistaking me for a woman, shouting abuse at me from passing vehicles, etc). It's been suggested that I may be non-binary and if I was growing up today I may have gone with that but I don't feel I need a label and, as gender is a societal construct, it's only non-binary by a rather limited definition of gender.

These statements are at odds. There's nothing wrong with being proud of the way you look, but ask yourself: if you had a son, would you want him to be valued mainly for his physical appearance? Do you think that would be a good path to loving himself?

Physicality is fleeting, ephemeral. Injury, accidents, even age will all change the way you look for the worse. 

Again, there's nothing wrong with being proud - hell, even *luxuriating* - in the way you look. But it's not healthy to derive your self-worth from it. 

Pursue the external validation if that's something you feel you need to do, but please don't let it be like the first dose of a drug. Looking for approval like this is addictive.

There being less young men (and women) having sex is not because of porn. The internet is definitely the core cause but Watching more porn is the symptom not the cause. This crisis of connection in our society is much bigger than just sex but you haven’t thought that far. 

This is not a personal responsibility issue. The stat is that 60% of American men aged 18-29 are single while it’s 30% for women at the same age. We have the most amount of single people ever.

Respect for the initiative and effort to uplift fellow men, but I feel as though just like those that make those posts, they're missing the real aspect they're actually caught up on. That being the inability to connect and make relations with women period. The virginity and sex aspect is the main talking point as its the ultimate proof of validity as self proclaimed by society and media/pop culture akin to what you mentioned in your article. Bare in mind, many of these men also have not had the opportunities to even decline women such as yourself, as they may or may not have even reached the stage where they are even perceived by women, let alone desired. That being said, I won't debate the talking point concerned with porn as I think it's a very case by case basis, but I digress. I must also note I am speaking from the point of somebody that is demisexual, so my own perception is skewed to begin with.	Waeladvice	reply	na	na	na	0.00868864357471466	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"The first message you posted was a rough one for me - I commented in two different posts of theirs on here but it likely had zero impact.

I know before I lost my v-plates that it was less the deed itself it was just that my friends (all loveless needs through school) had started getting girlfriends and sex was part of that. After losing my virginity it becomes obvious that the real achievement is getting to know someone at a new level, forging a life together, having kids, etc and that's kinda where everything stalled for me. All my friends were getting married and having kids, they rarely went out any more and I did feel lonely. However, I was studying hard, doing my own thing and I was a lot more confident in myself. Now an awful lot of married friends are divorced or married and unhappy (at least one has said he is jealous of me being able to do what I like, when I like and that is definitely a bonus).

The main lesson I've learned is that people are rarely happy with their relationship status, whether they are in one or not and the important thing is to be happy in yourself.

"If you aren't asexual, yes it is. It's hardwired into the majority of people to want to find a partner, fall in love, have a family, etc. It's so weird how people act like we can just magically forget about the only biological goal we have and not feel bad about missing out on the most important and fulfilling parts of life.

For most virgins, especially the kind you're trying to reach with this article, being a virgin doesn't just mean ""I haven't had sex"". It means ""I haven't been hugged since I was 5, I've never held hands or had a first kiss, I've never been on a date, I will die alone."" It's a perceived total failure at life, which is about as bad as it gets.

What most people don't realise is that having sex or a relationship even once means they are normal, they are good enough, another person chose them, and they will subconsciously know that for the rest of their lives. You say in your article that you've even been offered sex before, so that's why you can't possibly understand what it's like. You already know you're good enough. How are virgins meant to feel at 25 or 30 years old when no one has ever showed any interest? When all they've ever got is rejection? Eventually you have to accept that you're the problem, you're not good enough, no one wants you, you have failed. Don't act like you can tell other people what's important when you avoided that entirely. Being a virgin by choice isn't even remotely comparable."

I eventually had sex and guess what? I still felt awful. I had sex with several other women in a short space of time after that first time. Still felt awful. It was all shallow and horrible. 

It wasn’t lack of sex that was making me miserable. That was just one aspect of my loneliness that I’d hyper-fixated on at the time as a totem for what was ‘wrong’ with me. 

What I really craved was true intimacy, love, loyalty and closeness with a woman.

The guys who are virgins irl at the age of 21+ just don't talk about it because they're embarrassed so the guys who do talk about it feel like they're the major minority. 

Yeah, sex is great, but it definitely isn't going to change someone's outlook on life. If you have a shitty self image, sex isn't going to fix that. If that was true I would have a great self image just from the sex I'm having. If you feel unaccomplished/behind the curve of your peers, having sex isn't going to fix that. If you feel unloved, sex isn't going to fix that (might even make it worse), love and sex are not the same.

"I agree with the basic idea of what you're trying to say her, but completely dislike your antagonistic tone.  Telling people to ""put your ego down"" isn't helpful and for some will even completely turn them away from what you're saying.  I don't think it was your intention, but it's worth pointing out.

Anyways, to get to the root of the problem, you seem to be under the impression that to deal with it you just need to get over it, say who cares, and just work on yourself.  That last part is fine, but the first part doesn't work for everybody, not everybody is you and not everybody can simply get over it because, ""no one cares""(which isn't true btw, thats the whole problem is the stigma).  Different people function differently and your solution is not only not very helpful to the majority, but could even be harmful to some who are concerned about why they can't just get over it and will make them feel isolated for being bullied when you tell them ""no one cares"".

To get a bit personal, I'm going to use me as an example.  My situation is a bit different(I'm hypersexual and not a virgin), but similar.  Due to a mix of sexual trauma and social pressures I wanted to lose my virginity and did at 17(2 years ago).  I have had sex plenty of times since then, with 3 different people(4 if you count not going all the way).  Yet I still have problems with wanting sex all the time, especially while in a relationship, to the point that I feel unwanted and unloved if my partner doesn't want to have sex for a while.  Now of course I know that most likely they still love me, but that doesn't stop the thoughts and neither does telling myself to get over it.

I think a better way to go about it, yet not a perfect one, would be to do something like what I do.  Here's what I'd say.

I've been called a 3 out of 10, I am over 200 pounds with not much muscle, I'm 5'7, I work a part time job at a gas station, I'm pale, I got long greasy hair, awful looking facial hair, and a host of other negative things going on not only appearance wise, but mental and physical health wise.  However, I'm able to find relationships and sex partners, because I focus on what's good about me.  I make dark jokes and sex jokes, I'm overly nice, I compliment people a lot, and I just focus on being myself.  I don't worry about my money or my looks, I just try my best to be me.  Of course that can be hard for some people, but it's just a learning experience that takes time, you have to learn to not be hard on yourself because you can find someone out there for you.  If you need help improving your self image,please reach out to someone, whether it's a therapist who can help get to the root of the problem, or a trusted friend or family member who can help you figure out just how amazing you are.

Don't tell someone you can fix their problems if they do XYZ and try your best not to say something that's going to make them feel as though they're different.  Tell them advice, yes, but also tell them that everyone is different and that different things work for different people and refer them to a professional or at the very least some form of help.  My reply isn't perfect either, but still.  You just come off like your belittling their experience in a way.

"Are you looking for a relationship or are you just looking to sleep with women? If you're only looking to sleep with women, that's a big problem man. Because women are not looking just to sleep with you. You said it yourself, you break their hearts. You should not be doing what you're doing to them. You need to take yourself off the market and be single and celibate. You are causing harm to women and their trust, hopes, and futures. This is one reason why women act the way they act towards men today. Because they feel used.

If you decide not to take that advice, then take this advice instead; before you sleep with the next woman, sit down and talk to her and tell her things about you that you would not normally tell her at even your one year anniversary, yet alone on the first date. Loving relationships need to be based on communicating at the beginning things that could potentially be deal breakers. She gets to decide if you are for her because she's the other half of the potential relationship. And since you like to just sleep with them, let her know up front that that's all you want. Let her decide if she's cool with that. And also let her know that you're not looking for a relationship and to please not get attached. Don't be deceitful from here on out. Say what you mean and mean what you say. If it's meant to be, it will be. And if it's not, then that's life. But at least you had integrity. 

I don't know who taught you that it was okay to be this way, but it's time to unlearn it and become a man.

Hello all. I’m a 23 year old male who is currently suffering from many different anxiety disorders here’s my breakdown ~

I’m about to begin therapy but there is a chance that my health insurance might end soon so I will probably have to wait longer to just see a therapist to start treatment. I really have to get better now before my continuous declination. I have to travel again even if it’s only 20-30 miles down from my house.. I have no control over my life anymore. I can’t even stay home alone anymore. I could still drive to work, the gym and the super market all alone with no problem but the distance is always important.

2. Do you know the cause of open spaces fear, fear of heart attack and general anxiety? Did you experience some kind of adversity? Asking because the solution of the problem might be hidden in the root of the problem.

3. You go to the gym. First, it is famous with keeping people sane. Second, most of the people who workout, are healthy and their hearts are healthy. You have fear of heart attack, I know it's extremely difficult to overcome phobia like fears, but you have nothing to be afraid of because your heart is possibly healthy.

4. And cardiophobia involves chest pain. Yes, when the brain is afraid, sometimes the body psycosomatically experiences physical pain.

Men tend to deal with other men that they grew up with or see some utility in them. What value do you provide to your current friends that makes them like you?	The_Namez_B	reply	na	na	na	0.9852964282035828	no	no	strong	na	malementalhealth
"Trust your gut feelings...try to focus on the energy the males in your life sends/gives/puts out...and listen to how they talk about other people, especially their friends and family. If they always send out positive energy/vibes towards you and others let the relationship take its course. If they always seem to talk about their friends and family in a negative way behind their backs, then that's a red flag unless it's a genuinely good reason for it...but if they always talk down about them then more likely than not they're doing the same to you behind your back. 

Do a self check, and see if there are qualities about you that they may be exploiting for their own gain without ""returning the favor."" I'm in the US, and was born and raised in one of the most dangerous cities in America. The term we used for decades is ""gassing someone up,"" but the rest of the country picked up on that phenomenon recently and calls it gaslighting. Basically, someone that does, or says, something to make you think it's in your favor, but it's actually for their own benefit(s)...if they even do what they said they were gonna do. 

It's hard for males in general to start new friendships. But if you have common interests, hobbies, points of view and share the same positive energy then the friendship/relationship buds until someone feels slighted or feels like they're being used in one form or another. You're still very young, and at 25yo your brain is just about finished ""growing"" if you will. I understand the reluctancy to seek out relationships with other males if you feel they'll leave out of your life sooner rather than later. But not all males are like that. Give it a chance, don't give up yet. You'll find people will come in and out of your life for a reason...some stay longer some shorter. Some you may think have gone, but they may still think about the friendship you've had..and next time y'all see each other it's like picking up where you left off as if it was a few weeks ago versus months or years. But folks will always come in and out of your life throughout life... hold on to the ones that gives as much, if not more, as they take from you. I hope you find males you can trust and have a great relationship/friendship with. Males downplay how much friendships mean, but as they age they realize how much they really need them."

Ever since I came out, people have been treating me different when I talk about my mental health. Like they don’t care and I’m just being a nuisance. I plan to expect this more once I start passing.

"Hey, so I am still a teenager living under my moms roof. I don’t have much longer till I can move out but I feel conflicted. I have a nice house, and food to eat, but no boundaries. I’ll list of some of this things that my mom does/did.

- she has a second phone connected to my phone that receives all my texts so she can read, monitor, and even respond to my texts for me. Its always been this way. I also have never been allowed to download apps or have safari on my phone. She has the restrictions password for that, and anytime I ask for an app, she just says “you don’t need that” before she knows what it even is.

- She has very bad arthritis and chronic pain and walks around cussing, complaining, and anytime me or my dad ask her if she needs helps with any tasks she snaps at us and will say things like “no it’s fine” in a really passive aggressive way.

- she does NOT listen. She interrupts like crazy and then gets mad if you ever interrupt her. 

- on a similar note, she’ll ask a question, interrupt your answer then be surprised that you gave an incomplete answer.

- she will stay up at night texting me insisting that I’m awake and on my phone and saying I need to put it up when I was asleep. (See my post history)

- she used to pinch, spank, slap and grab me and my sister on the butt and get mad when we’d tell her to stop. Say we’re being sassy, ask why, call us bitches. She’d do it in front of people to humiliate us.

- up until this past fall, she had my social media accounts logged in on her phone only and would go through my stuff. 

- when she reads my messages or looks through social media she’ll deliberately ask inflaming questions that I obviously wouldn’t know the answer to.

- she’d do a similar thing just with any social relationship I’d have and would always try to get involved with my friends and such and get involved in THEIR life and drama too.

- she has my location on at all times 

- she will freak out in any one or more of these ways then feel bad not apologize, but instead take me to dinner or buy me something etc. she’ll then use that against me in the future if I express how she makes me feel.

- she comes to her own conclusions before you even speak to her. A recent example is I woke up after hanging with some friends the night before and the first thing she says is “so you were with your friends? I bet they’re no good”.

- now my dad, who I love, often tries to be the peacekeeper. But due to my moms abhorrent communication skills she often will interrupt and yell at him until he eventually just gives up and leaves the house. He’ll then come to me in pretty much disbelief and vent about it, which I understand but I find myself disassociating so easily. He also works 75+ hours a week and my mom works part time so my dad has always been pretty financially obsessed, and he will always talk to me about how much money my mom is wasting, or how much money my sister is wasting in college, etc. I feel like he’s the only family I have though. 

This is a VERY abridged version of some of her behaviors and I’m feeling very lost. I feel shame because of the things I’d do out of fear and no education. Ugh. Anyone have any advice?"	DeadBoloBozo	post	18.76062801295176	female	White	0.997886598110199	na	na	na	2	malementalhealth
"I’ll tell you this monetize your favorite hobby and find a job. Start, using the library and searching for information you need to live on your own. Make yourself independent that way you’re not feeling guilt but also so that your mom can’t control you.

Your dad will be able to breathe when he knows his kids are ok that’s the only reason why he’s staying from what you’ve told us in this post. 

Get therapy man, coming from someone who had some mom issues stuff like that will haunt your relationships forever. Even now I can’t stay in friend groups for more than a year without this anxiety of control kicking in. 

More importantly goodluck and get good grades. Then talk to your dad, it sucks that you don’t have parents on either spectrum but you can at least be a friend to him while all this is happening"	DeadBoloBozo	reply	na	na	na	0.997886598110199	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"That sounds like textbook abusive behaviour from your mom. And since your dad work so much looks like he doesn't even realise.

Like the social media double account and her messaging your friends for you, her knowing where all your whereabouts are, her restricting your access to internet (therefore other people for help), her slapping/touching you in appropriately, and especially with the aim to humiliate you, her pretty much gaslighting you or manipulating you in situation when you try to put up boundaries. That's all textbook abusive cohersive behaviour.

Now, I'm not sure exactly what age your are, you says you're a teenager but not long until you're able to move out. You need to think about a proper plan to get yourself out, but as well get yourself out in an intelligent manner so that you can maximise your situation and don't get yourself in a precarious situation afterwards. Sometimes it might be worth to wait a little bit more in order to be able to set up a better exit.

First, does your school has a nurse/councillor? If you can't get a therapist, that's your next best bet, although be careful with school councillors, they might not be bound by medical privacy law, but they could as well be very resourceful in order to direct you towards NGOs that could be very helpful for your situation.

You could try to maybe fetch back some indépendance from your mother, for exemple, change your social media account passwords to something doesn't know? Look up how (or go ask a phone shop) how to impair your phone from hers. I'm not sure from which country you are, but some countries have some data privacy laws and therefore at least in theory you able to withdraw your consent from your mother get your personal messages phone, etc. In practice you might be able to get the phone shops to do the unpairing for you, but again, it's probably a European thing.
A BIG WORD OF WARNING though, doing that might give your more space to plan your exit, but it will as well wreck havoc in your life, as it very likely your mother will HEAVILY push back on this new boundary setting of yours and will make your life a living hell in other way she can. You might be better of planning stealthily, accessing ressources using your school librairy or friends computer and phones.


Some questions that can help you start assessing your situation and therefore plan an exit strategy: What is your personal financial situation? Do you have a job? If yes, how much does it pays? Is it enough to maintain yourself in your town?
Do you want to study? If you want to study, are there types of jobs(like evening ones) which would make it able to maintain yourself whilst studying? Maybe you could take up an apprenticeship of some sorts for your studies (usually they are renumerated)?

Now you have a descent relation with your father, I assume that if you leave your house you will want to keep it, you'll have to think about how to do that whilst not compromising your safety (IE make sure your mom doesn't know where you leave)."

I have a few ideas for you.  One, is make yourself attractive as a friend.  I'm not referring to beauty, rather a warm smile and taking a genuine interest in the other person - find out their likes / dislikes, hobbies, goals in life.  Studies have shown that people will like you more when they get to talk about themselves.  Next, put yourself in a position where you can make friends.  Bars... not great.  Join some intermural / mixed sex sports teams at your community gym;  take some classes for fun that involve socialization - climbing for example;  join a church young adult group - I've made my best friends in life there and met my future spouse.	hgarrus1213	reply	na	na	na	0.9993776679039001	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"Hey man, that’s definitely a shitty situation you’re in. Best I can recommend is to find happiness in yourself first. 

It’s not attractive to hang around someone with such disdain for themselves that they would call themself “worthless”. You’re anything but. 

What are your hobbies? You talk about clubs and activities which is already an awesome step in the right direction, but are you doing them to meet people? Or are you doing them to make yourself happy? It should be the latter. 

Keep doing what you love, focus on you and not on getting friends/girlfriends. And once people start flocking to you, keep yourself open to them. Don’t try and force it, as friends are just another relationship; not every one is going to be a good match. Some of my best friends I have I’ve met on discord by playing games and being open to talking to randos. Most of them were awful, but it only took one dude inviting me to their discord server, where I met a bunch of really awesome people that I now even see IRL.

I guess what I mean is, focus on one foot in front of the other and stop worrying as much about the finish line. You’ll get there, you just gotta keep at it. Focus on you, and don’t try and change yourself or force yourself into activities that don’t bring you joy at first. People can pick up on if you don’t actually want to be there. And people can definitely tell if you’re trying too hard. I know “be yourself” is cliche, but no one really explains what that means. Be yourself and surround yourself in what YOU love, and you’ll eventually meet others who share the same loves and passions as you. Let them in to JOIN each other, not to gain something.

Imo—the key is to pursue what you’re really passionate about. You dont have to know the definition of that to a T, but just pursuing this will naturally align you with people you get along with. Just think about it, when you guys relate in a deep and detailed way, rapport, affiliation, friendship, relation, cooperation, etc is logically to follow. Do it a lot. Go on the Meetup app and try things you’re really curious about, join groups, if you’re spiritual, there’s a lot of community around that, just pursue your interests and don’t be needy—i.e. focus on the interest—if you’re doing it with ulterior motives, real passionate practitioners and hobbyists will resent your shallowness and people will be turned off by insecurely-driven desires.	hgarrus1213	reply	na	na	na	0.9993776679039001	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"You're not worthless, you matter to people that you haven't even met yet. You have time, here's some tips.

1. Learn to be uncomfortable, we humans of modern society live in prisons of comfort. Being uncomfortable, and doing new things you might not like, will get you noticed by people eventually. 

2. There are tons of people who are in your situation, and want friends. You should try to connect with other people who are in your shoes. If you're a nerd, go to a  TCG (Trading card game) store where people play others, D&D as well. 

3. Bars are alright, but way overrated, you should try book clubs as well if you enjoy reading. Keep an eye on events in your town that fancy your taste, and try to connect with people. But also remember, these are scary times so people might be wary of you as well, it's not your fault, that's just life, and there's bad people everywhere. 

4. Since you exercise, I'm very certain there are people who like the stuff you like that go to gyms, and others places like rock climbing and such. Try those places out. 

5. Don't force yourself into people's lives, make good memories with people you just met somewhere, and just be cool, be goofy, have fun, and since you'll be new to meeting people. Don't listen to what your brain says if it starts telling you that like ""they don't like you"". Let peoples actions speak for themselves, and remember let your actions speak as well, as actions are louder than words.

6. Basic conversation starters like, what's shows do they like? Books? Fiction? Non-fiction? What school subjects to they like and excel in? Movies? People that inspire these individuals? Music? Do they play instruments? Etc. Lots of ways to start a conversation, and keep it going. It doesn't have to be an intellectual conversation, it could be a basic getting to know each other. Don't over think about it, just ask genuine questions, and most of all be genuine."	hgarrus1213	reply	na	na	na	0.9993776679039001	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

With things the way they're going I am going to have to work more jobs and never have a day off just to keep living indoors and keep myself fed. These will be jobs in the service industry where I will be low on the totem. I will really miss the life I've lived of having days off and occasional vacations. I will also be filled with envy knowing that so many others around me have off days and more money. I don't know when I will be able to cut back on working hours. Perhaps never. How will I cope?

God damnit, I can't see things ever getting better.

"It’s a very weird habit where I’ll watch porn when I feel at my worst. The worst part about it is about a day or two prior I’ll notice a bit more confidence and calmness within me. I don’t feel as awkward when I abstain from it for 7-10 days. But then I’ll get this emotional and mental crash where the weight of the world seems to just pile on top of me and I feel utterly worthless. 

In all fairness there is some truth to that. I don’t have alot going for me and my future looks very bleak, but during those 7-10 days when I haven’t watched porn in able to think more positive and see things in a better light. On top of that if I’m invited out for drinks after work or something I’ll have even less of a want for it. But one negative comment, or bad memory and some sort of numb feeling covers me and I just feel like shit again. And it seems like porn is the only stimulant that remedy that effectively. But after it, I notice how much more awkward I become. I avoid eye contact more, I find less of a need to go out and everything is the worse case scenario for about 4 days

I don’t really know what to do instead since it’ll literally be 2-3am when these feelings are at its peak and I have no obligation to do anything the next day. Part of me thinks I should just get a full time job to help with this but I just feel like that’s bottling what I truly feel."

"The only time there's a problem watching porn is if it causes you or someone else ""harm."" If it's the guilt of watching porn, I kinda get it. Just remember porn probably makes up most of internet traffic outside of work/school work, so you're not alone. If you're single, it kinda serves a purpose for a need to do ""man maintenance,"" to keep everything in tip top shape, and to prevent prostatitis, epididymitis and other physiological sexual issues...and to some extent psychological issues. It's all about balance in life. Always good to go out and socialize, especially these days when it seems a lot of folks only communicate via devices and social media versus face to face interactions. If you are single and start dating, there's still nothing wrong with watching porn...even married guys watch porn so it goes back to having a good balance with it and life.

"It sounds like you're struggling with a complex set of issues related to mood, self-esteem, and porn use. While porn may provide temporary relief from negative feelings, it can also lead to negative consequences such as feelings of shame and withdrawal, difficulty with intimacy, and addiction.

Please remember that there is no shame in seeking help for these issues. You may find it helpful to speak with a therapist or counselor who can provide you with support and guidance as you work through these challenges. They can help you identify the root causes of your negative feelings and develop healthier coping mechanisms to address them.

I think you are on the way to go already knowing that loneliness and idleness are triggers.  Please explore volunteering opportunities.  It would keep you occupied with meaningful works.  You would also focusing on the needs of others rather than yourself.

Please check out a local Christian church near you.  They usually have life group similar to your background.

"My guy you're 19. You got your whole life ahead of you. And I know it's hard to see past how important sex is made out to be by society and internet trolls and all that jazz, but there genuinely is so much more to life than that.

When I was 19 I too had nothing but sex on my mind, and honestly it had me depressed and got me into alot of bad situations with people that I shouldn't have gotten involved with just cause I wanted to bang. My entire worldview and how I viewed all relationships with people hinged around getting some. And I was super miserable for it. It ruined alot of relationships with people i otherwise would have been friends with too.

I'm 25 now. Therapy and working on how I think about people and things helped me immensely. And funny enough doing that, healing, becoming more stable, and not clawing for sex made me more sexually desirable.

"You are 19 right? 
Why do people fear missing out so much in life but are ready to end it for stupid reasons? Would you not miss out on life then? 
I know what you are feeling. It's fomo and you should seek therapy rather than ending what people crave to live again. 

I'm 19 too and fortunately, life hasn't even started yet. I haven't earned anything yet.  And I know how many people give up on their lives but they all seem to be the ones who want to live more. Just imagine a single parent who fears dying for their kid. And a soldier who fears death because he wants to save his people. 

You would end it now because you think you are missing out on sex to satisfy your lust, but you won't be alive afterwards to repent on how much you have missed out on life, how brutally you missed out living itself. 

Such phases are temporary. Nobody wants to live with pain and shame. If people hated life so much, then my grandma wouldn't have gone through 6 surgeries and the 25 years living with her pain. Medicines and hospitals wouldn't be so valuable . 

During the pandemic, we all wished for our close ones  to be healthy. You are someone's close one too. They might have plans for you, would you want them to not live their plans just because you don't want to live your plans either?

"I have used testosterone in the past for performance purposes. Just go to the GP and get bloodwork done and include hormones.

 Don't know what country you're in but I'm presuming it's fairly straightforward to get on trt if you have low test.

Alternatively purchasing and self administering testosterone is very easy.

 Testosterone improves mental health in people with low testosterone sure but one would also have to make sure their estrogen in balance as some people can have increased anxiety from the increase in hormones."	Monked800	reply	na	na	na	0.9979621171951294	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"I've been taking AndroGel for a few years now, due to certain medications interfering with my natural production of Testosterone. I'm on 40.5mg a day, or 2 pumps of Androgel. There was another issue with my thyroid and had to have that removed due to it enlarging so quickly. 

I find AndroGel helps with my mood, and it does provide help with depression if that's one of your issues... along with increased energy, some more secondary sexual characteristics growth aka more chest, arm and leg hair than before. Muscle tone is improved..can't wait to start working out again. I'm in my late 40s (painful to read after I typed this lol) and started trt back in 2018. My testosterone levels before were in the 570-750 range up until my late 30s. They say bisexuals in general have higher testosterone levels than typical heterosexual or homosexual males. When I started a particular medicine I wish to remain anonymous about, it dropped my T levels down to the 120-150 range.

You would ask your gp/primary doctor for blood work to check your testosterone levels...free T and bioavailable T. Most just do the bioavailable T levels I believe. If you're within the normal range (200-900) they will not start you on TRT. The only way they would is if you had a baseline test done before, and if they see a noticable decline in a short period of time they will run tests to see if it's something else that's causing low T. 

Like mentioned, you could try to boost your T naturally by lifting weights, exercising, eating foods that help boost it maintain T levels, and also sex helps boost T levels as well so there's a perk. The more you ejaculate the higher your levels can get to a point..so if your a 1x a week or longer kinda guy, try doing ""maintenance"" 2-5x a week. 

Regardless, get blood work done and try to get a baseline test from the recent past if there was one done. If deemed necessary, always keep up with blood work to make sure certain functions are still normal like liver and kidney functions, cholesterol levels, PSA levels,etc. Up your intake of water, exercise and mind your diet. Certain foods can lower T levels or block the normal process with testosterone.

"Recently, I was researching on this  community for male mental health

I spent some time scrolling, and…

I noticed certain posts, that seem repetitive and relatable to many.

**“She broke up with me, I wanna k\*ll myself”**  
**”She is the one, I can’t live without her ”**

**“No woman will ever love me on earth”**

The last one was more repeated than the others

But I think that you get the point that I’m trying to show you,

And honestly...

  
I was in the same situation a few years ago and understand.

&#x200B;

 Whenever a kind girl talked to me, I was lifted into a different world.

Creating Fake scenarios in my mind, especially in my dreams.

I desperately thought, “If I am with her, I’ll be happy!”, which meant setting barriers and limits on my mental health.

As a result, I wasted a few months Only thinking about her, being on auto-pilot, worsening my mental health, and getting lost in my everyday life.

To the point that everything else didn’t matter to me anymore, I didn’t have any purpose in life.

But luckily, I am not that person anymore.

If you are facing similar problems, maybe this article can give you a little help

I totally understand what are you saying but doesn't it hurt when you are crushing on a girl and suddenly your best friend who doesn't know that you are crushing on her and he's the closest someone has ever been to you becomes her closest friend and she's also the first girl to talk to him too so you deny your feelings and mute them so you don't hurt your best friend.......

"I have seen so many people say that you need to find a purpose, but think about this for a second.  Isn't it fucking sad for your purpose in life to be some stupid hobby or your job?  ""Wow, you collected a lot of green paper"", or ""Wow, you whittled some little wood figurines like 10,000 other people on Etsy"".  These things are really what you're living for?  Not human connection?

I agree that ruminating for a long time on one particular girl isn't healthy or wise, but doesn't -not- doing that fly in the face of seeing them all as human beings?  Like if you can just drop them and move on the instant it's clear they won't date you, aren't you seeing them all as interchangeable?

"What the title says, I’m 23 years old, 216lb, and 6”3,’ I’ve never had any kind of romantic or sexual experience whatsoever and as my username implies, I’m on the autism spectrum, I absolutely hate being autistic because of my limited social skills and anxiety that I feel both prevent me from talking to women and getting a girlfriend. My two stepbrothers are both in relationships (one’s dating while the other one’s married) and I can’t help but be envious of both of them, same goes for all my former classmates and acquaintances and whenever I see them post on their Facebook or Instagram pages about them getting a boyfriend/girlfriend, getting engaged, getting married, and having kids, it just serves to remind me that I can’t have or achieve any of that. I am also ashamed to say that I am a virgin, I feel society seems to make losing your virginity everything and a crucial step into becoming a man and I am one of those who haven’t yet lost theirs. I think it’s also important to note that I don’t consider myself to be a typical incel, at least anymore, and I certainly don’t condone that kind of behavior now, I just call myself an incel due to the fact that I feel that I can’t get a girlfriend and I often find myself thinking about ending it all because of it, not a day goes by without me fantasizing about blowing my brains out, but I know I would never do it because suicide is against my religious beliefs. I’m on antidepressants and see a counselor once a month and it does help to some extent, but not a lot. My parents know that I have suicidal thoughts and have threatened to send me to an institution twice before, which I hope doesn’t happen to me because I saw bad reviews on Google from those who claim to be former patients.

I first became an incel around my junior year and I tried everything that I could think of to get a girlfriend, I started asking acquaintances if they had any friends who were single and when that failed, I then started asking out classmates I was assigned to work with on projects when the week was over, this also didn’t work. After those both failed, I then decided to take a gamble and ask out a really hot girl named Kate that sat in front of me in algebra class and I was quite surprised when she accepted, but I ended up getting stood up by her. Upon turning 18 and graduating high school, I tried joining a couple of dating apps, but I kept getting locked out of my account on the first app I tried and the competition I had to deal with proved to be too stressful for me so I decided to stop using dating apps altogether. My mom said I should go to the local community college and see if I can meet anyone there, which lead me to briefly think about taking some classes there, but I decided not to in the end because none of the classes sounded interesting to me and besides, I always had trouble paying attention in school and even if I did end up trying to meet girls there, I don’t think security would take kindly to someone on campus who’s not even there to learn anything. Since nothing was working out right in my search for love, I decided to take a break and focus on developing a more positive mindset, but unfortunately, this was also around the time when the pandemic hit and I quickly relapsed back into my pessimistic old self and I’ve now pretty much accepted that I’m a cynical person by nature and that there’s nothing I can do to change that except to try and be a little less cynical.

Now I want to try again, I’m currently talking with a girl named Everly (who’s autistic like me) I met through one of my mom’s clients and we talk every week through Facebook, one time, I asked Everly for her number and I gave her mine first, but she said she wasn’t comfortable giving it to me yet, I immediately apologized and we continued talking like nothing happened. A few months later, while on a family vacation to Florida recently, a cousin of mine showed me how to make a shell necklace and I made mine to give to Everly, but once I told her about it, she said she didn’t want it, even though I made that necklace with her in mind! I then told her I was going to give her the necklace if we ever met in person and if she didn’t want it, I completely understood, she then ended the conversation there, but thankfully, we’re still friends and still talking to each other, but I can’t help but feel extremely awkward about the whole situation that occurred. I usually consult my parents (my mom and stepdad) for advice and whenever my mom and stepdad go out to a bar or something like that, they always invite me to come along and I always decline, because frankly, I’m uninterested in meeting women in bars due to multiple factors, plus, I don’t want to be a third wheel and ruin their night.
Plus, I was always told growing up by my parents that if a girl liked me, she would approach me first, now I realize that what they told me was absolute bullshit, and besides, it’s not like any girl would want to go out with or be interested in a Neanderthal like me.

I originally posted about my history as an incel on the r/IncelExit subreddit, but I had to divide it up into six parts due to the longevity of the post and shortly after posting it all, parts two and six got taken down by the mods because they thought it was quote unquote “sexist,” even though that wasn’t my intention at all. I decided next to repost everything on r/exredpill and nearly all of the comments were negative and unsupportive, one commenter was critical of my writing style, another called me entitled and others just accused me of spamming. I thought about posting again on r/IncelExit, this time, writing a shorter and more condensed post on there or r/exredpill, but I honestly don’t feel welcome in those communities anymore. I don’t know where else to post, if this post ends up getting taken down, I don’t know where else I could post, I feel I can’t talk to anyone I know in real life about my problems because they’ll just tell me to get over it and that God has someone picked out for me and he’ll send her to me when the time comes or something like that. Plus, I can’t tell anyone that I’m having suicidal thoughts because they’ll try to institutionalize me!

I don’t think that I’ll ever find love, I just think it’s not going to happen, even though I want it to, I want to find a girlfriend, get married, and have kids, just a simple dream that I think is next to impossible to accomplish for an autistic person like me and seeing all my old peers and how happy their lives are with a spouse and children makes me feel even worse about things. I honestly want to end everything, but at the same time, I don’t want to die. I’m just so confused, I wish I didn’t have emotions or the ability to feel any negative feelings. I don’t know who to listen to or what to do about everything, I suppose I’m doomed to live life without ever knowing what it’s like to be loved by a woman because I’m pathetic and I feel no girl will ever love me.

"I cannot help you with how your autism affects this, though I’m sure other commenters will have a lot of good advice from their experiences. 

What I noticed after reading your entire post, is that I know nothing about you. All those words, and all you talked about was other people. I’d suggest stopping the search and chase, and start figuring out what u/PessimisticAutistic likes and wants in life. I don’t mean find out what kind of women you want to date. Do you like the outdoors? Sports? Tabletop games? Knitting? Making sculptures out of oatmeal? Start working on that. Find out what makes you happy for you. 

Do those things, and the things that help you move forward in life (job or volunteer opportunities that help you develop responsibility, priorities, and schedule management skills), so that when you have to opportunity to meet and possibly date someone, you won’t be relying on them to be your entire world. You’ll be able to share your world with them, and they share theirs with you.

"I think you need to see a specialist who works with people with autism. At least from what I read here, it seems like you’re coming off quite strong. There are people dedicated to providing therapy and assisting with behavioral change for people such as yourself who might not be picking up on more subtle social cues. 

I get it. I have autism too and I feel like my success has simply been good guidance. Parents don’t expect to have an autistic kid and so they aren’t experts. It helps to seek out someone who is experienced in these issues who will likely have resources for you as this is a common problem for us. A good therapist will not only be able to address specific issues, but will also be knowledgeable about events, groups, and other means of practicing going on dates, and perhaps finding relationships. 

Even if you achieve a date, there is still the possibility that this new territory could prove difficult as well so that extra help can guide you all the way through. 

Don’t make the mistake of thinking you’re unlovable or hopeless. You’re not. You clearly care a lot and are thoughtful. There’s just a lot of hidden social rules we are expected to know and if you are on the outside of that it can be really hard. But there’s always people willing to help.

"> seeing all my old peers and how happy their lives are with a spouse and children makes me feel even worse about things.

I went through a similar period when friends were all getting married and having kids. It's rough. Then, a few years later when you talk to them and a lot of them are either divorced and in a worse position than you or still married and miserable. One friend told me he was envious of my single life, while I was envious of him with a wife and child.

Life doesn't have victory conditions and if you try and set them you'll either never reach them and be miserable or you get them and you find it wasn't all that it was cracked up to be.

So you are an involuntary celibate? Welcome to the world, just about everyone has a dry spell - I know some married couples who last had sex before you were born. Being a virgin is really only a big deal in your head and once you lose the V plates it isn't a big deal. You realise that getting a relationship is actually more important. Then you achieve that and realise that maintaining the relationship is key but the longer it goes on the harder it is to keep all the plates spinning and it never ends. If being a virgin is seriously detrimental to your mental health, find an escort and get it over with but don't expect it to change anything (other than your bank account).

I can't claim to know the secret of life but it seems to be that you need to focus on being happy in yourself, ignoring real.or imagined expectations of society, not expecting external validation from others and just trying to be the best person you can."

You see what they want you to see. You don't know if they are happy at all deep within them just like probably definitely some of those peers don't know you have suicidal thoughts beacause they only see what you want them to too.

It's nice to want to have a girfriend and all but that also comes with its own sets of problems and it's not like ""puff"" happiness is going to come. Of course having someone with you will help with support when you're down and such, but again, it's not the only thing that brings happiness and not what you should aim for to be happy.

Feeling deeply insecure about the fact that no woman has ever crushed on me. Most of my friends have been in relationships or rejected women that crushed on them, not me though. I will never make a woman's day happier just by my presence. No woman will ever think about me romantically.

"> I am 17M, autistic

> I will never make a woman’s day happier just by my presence.

Uh oh, you might be me from the past.  Whether you are or not, let me give you some advice now that I’m 24.

1.) “No woman ever crushing on you” is, unfortunately, likely to be a part of your anxiety for a long time.  The sooner you learn to recognize this and other bullshit that your brain says for what it is, the better for your mental health.

2.) Even when you do become someone’s crush, you won’t realize it.  Possibly for a long time.  Possibly for the entire time they’re crushing on you.  Part of this is social hurdles, part of it is second-guessing caused by the fact that you’re anxious about this.

3.) People say this a lot and you probably won’t listen, just like I didn’t.  But remember that you can find fulfilling relationships nonromantically!  This is especially easy after high school, but if you can find a handful of friends that you care about, and they care back, that’s ultimately going to be more important than one person who is all that, plus you make out sometimes.

4.) For the love of yourself, don’t let your desperation drive you to online dating.  It isn’t made to help guys like us, it’s made to turn our desperation into addiction so we’ll spend money."	Jealous_Elk_9984	reply	na	na	na	0.9985597729682922	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"You’re only 17, and I’m assuming you’re still in High School. That’s not to minimize what you’re feeling but rather to reframe it. You’re still very young in the grand scheme of life. As others have said in this thread, this feeling isn’t uncommon. Your feeling is certainly valid, and you shouldn’t beat yourself up for feeling this way. However, saying “no women will ever…” is a cognitive distortion known as “fortune telling”. [This is a good resource to identify and “defuse” distortions when you come across them.](https://positivepsychology.com/cognitive-distortions/#common-cognitive-distortions). 

All this is to say you’re not alone in having felt like this and you’ve got a lot of life ahead of you. And one of the most impactful thing you can do to cultivate romantic relationships is develop an appreciation and love for yourself. Lord knows it isn’t easy, but definitely worth it."

"When I was 21 years old, I wrote in my diary that because I wasn’t having sex or a relationship, and didn’t know how to, I believed I was going to get more and more insecure and inexperienced compared to those around me, and that I was just gonna be alone and involuntarily celibate forever. I don’t know if I actually believed that, but for sure a big part of me carried that huge insecurity. What I’ve learned in the years since has shown me that it definitely doesn’t work like that. 

It took many years, but by the time I was 25, I had a relationship (which ended) and another when I was 26 (which also ended). Now I’m 27, and although I come out of two very hard and very sad heartbreaks, I now known that some people I find attractive will also find me attractive. And the thing is, when I believed nobody would find me attractive, I carried myself in a way that made people insecure to be around me. Maybe that’s happening with you right now. That can definitely change. Now I carry myself with much more ease, and since people feel more relaxed around me, I’m noticing that actually more people than I thought at least show some level of interest in me. Even though I’m single now, I’m sure I’ll find someone that I’ll be happy with. 

What worked for me is working on myself in a healthy (not a grind set/pickup artist) kinda way. That included healthy habits, and it also included going to therapy, and being brave enough to share these insecurities with my therapist, even though it made me feel small and emasculated. It helped a lot. A big part of what I learned was that my insecurities largely stemmed from a difficult childhood with a mentally ill mother and emotionally unavailable father, plus social trauma from bullying and exclusion in primary school. I was projecting this expectation of rejection learned in childhood onto people in adulthood. Working on that underlying trauma has done wonders for my sexual health and ability to form relationships. Maybe you carry some trauma that might be blocking your self-love as well. 

Teenage years and young adulthood are hard hard hard. For practically everyone. Also those who have success in sex and relationships, believe me. Don’t be too hard on yourself, it takes time to learn to love and accept yourself. All this isn’t helped by our atomization in society, where we no longer exist in community. Trust is so crucial to sex and relationships (also for men!!!), so the fact that we’re atomized I believe is at the center of the loneliness and mental health epidemics plaguing us. It’s really not your fault you feel alone, but by finding ways to heal your wounds and insecurities you can maybe find your own niche within this otherwise dystopian horror show of 21st century society. 

Btw, my work is not done. Now that I’m single, I’m noticing a lot of my old sexual insecurities popping up. So I decided to go to a sex therapist. I’ll have my first session in June, and I’m really looking forward to it, because I know that a lot of good things will come out of it. Healing yourself never ends, but there’s always something good that comes out of it every time you do. I know all this therapy I’m speaking of costs money, but if you have the means, or are lucky enough to live in a place where you can get government support for it (like me), then it’s very much worth it. 

Hang in there, have some patience, you’ll be alright. The fact that you’re reaching out here is already a sign that you on some level love yourself, and are on the right path. Also, specifically that you reach out here and not into a collectively self-loathing woman-hating incel forum, or a forum for pickup artists where you’re taught to reject your true self, become someone you’re not and deliberately manipulate people and overstep their boundaries.

"To avoid future frustration consider limiting your investment of time and energy into someone to only what you are willing to give without ending up bitter if they don't meet your expectations.

When someone doesn't meet your expectations, and you feel frustration, consider that this is new information about the person, and it might warrant updating your expectations. Whatever someone does, even when it relates to you, is not really about you, but is a reflection of them.

Another policy you could consider is not working harder than the other person on their problems. I get asked for help with software related questions and my first response is to usually ask a few questions, and see how much effort the person has put in and will put in with me on their problem.

It sounds like you probably shared detailed information. Although I'm sure it doesn't boil down to this, but your friend may not have been willing or capable to understand what you wrote. When presented with an easier path they could easily understand from someone else, they decided to follow that. Since they are clearly not knowledgeable about cars, they have no basis to asses the merits of one piece of advice or another. So they go with the easy convenient one.

Of course such an approach by your friend may lead them down the wrong path to solve their problem. And there may be other traits they are displaying to you that you don't like. Totally reasonable to make adjustments to your investment into this friendship.

However consider that your friend probably has no idea about how you feel or that their behavior has had any affect on you whatsoever. You're under no obligation to let them know of course. Perhaps one day they will change in some way.

Hopefully some of those ideas are helpful to manage and avoid your frustration with this person and others."	Over-Moment6258	reply	na	na	na	0.9995013475418091	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"I don’t know entirely how to start this but I guess I’ll just kinda get into it. So recently I met this girl on bumble and we hung out and one thing led to another, I guess getting down to iteverytime I finish I feel horrendous, like the most depressive state one can be in, and just want to get rid of the girl in front of me and just go on a drive and think/listen to music. 

I don’t want to talk to any girl at all after either, I usually become a dry texter just enough to get them to stop texting a ton and eventually ghosting me in the process.

This has occurred every time I’ve had encounters with a hook-up (5 total), for context I’ve never been in a relationship either and I do enjoy intercourse. I just kinda don’t understand why I get so depressed and want to isolate myself from every girl in the world after.  

Sometimes I feel like if I ever genuinely get into a relationship I’ll always feel this issue

How do you guys feel? Can you relate? Can you not, I’d love to hear what you guys did to fix it or overcome it as well"	Vrooother	post	16.92449228484248	male	White	0.9989326596260071	na	na	na	2	malementalhealth
Well I can't relate to the intercourse bit because I'm a trashcan apparently but I feel like it's fairly common to have that drop in mood after an orgasm. One thing I haven't looked into much is if it matters how much energy and passion one puts into getting off.	Vrooother	reply	na	na	na	0.9989326596260071	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
Your body is craving the sex, your mind wants genuine human connection. The post nut depression is just the 24 hours where you're left with just the need for genuine human connection. If you're in a committed meaningful relationship this feeling shouldn't happen, you cuddle after sex. You'll never respect an easy woman and this will happen most/every time with easy women.

"Hey y’all - 30 years old - clean of cocaine and MDMA for 2 and a half years but I still drink pretty regularly and heavily. I have ADHD and I’m scared af to see a doctor about it because I know medication would help but I also know I’ll abuse them/get addicted. In the mean time I’m working a full time job at home and have been for 3 years and I’ve been in a loving relationship for 4 years.

I’ve done all the research I can do without seeing a therapist or whatever and I know the best thing for me would be to get on medication but as previously mentioned… I’m nervous. 

I got off cocaine cold turkey (kinda was forced to, my plug went to jail and the market was too difficult at the start of Covid to re establish a connect).  I never went “too far” as I did my best to manage myself throughout my addiction but I have no doubt I was hooked. I do miss my “cocaine cowboy” days but I don’t miss the endless money issues and lack of good jobs. Alcoholism is so much more manageable anyways. 

All in all my rant is just to say… what are your thoughts? Ask me questions, feel free to tell me your experiences! 

My inclination is to see a doc and just be honest about my previous addictions but my addict brain thinks “don’t say a word, get pills, get high.” But even still part of me thinks… will I even get high if I need the medication?

"Fellow adhd guy here. Most people with adhd don't abuse the medication. It ""fills"" that void you need, if you find the right dose. I've never really been addicted to any substances. But I have been addicted to certain games, the medication helps me stop gaming, or at least be easier to turn it off after I've been playing.

I also take a non stimulant medication to help with full day help. This removes the desire for more ""casual"" drinks or gaming when I shouldn't. 

I still struggle with the perfect dose. But I find they at least help."	WhiskeyBluess	reply	na	na	na	0.6845667362213135	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

There's been good progress on non-stimulant alternatives for medicating ADHD.

Yeah. That phrase “the bar couldn’t be lower” in reference to women dating men is frustrating. It’s usually taking basic standards we have for women and applying them to men.

"I hear you. I really do. Offering this in case it fits you and helps. 

The key for me was to learn to stop trying. Stop trying to be funny and confident and assertive etc. The trying was a manifestation of the codependent, people-pleaser in me. Women can sniff out the “trying” part and it inevitably becomes super unattractive. They can’t trust you because they don’t know who you are. They just see this part that tries to do everything right but they’re left wondering who the real you is. Flaws and all. They’ll wonder if YOU even know you. If they can’t trust you, and trust that you know you, they’ll never feel safe or at ease. 

Focus on yourself. Build confidence in yourself. Stop trying to get a partner by trying to be perfect. Learn to be assured in who you are, the value you bring to a relationship, all of your imperfections that make you human, and manage the parts of you that might be desperate to have a relationship so you’re not alone. For me that looked like taking care of my physical, mental, and emotional health through the gym, yoga, reading, writing, therapy, music, and hiking. Once I found the things that actually filled my cup, I no longer felt I needed to do the mental gymnastics to keep someone in my sphere.

I understand as I didn’t know how to play the cool flirting well. I guess I come of shy and when I drank I would be over the top. I got a temp job as a truck driver for a charity. I would pickup donations and drop off beds,clothes and other items to the needy. A lot of people volunteered there for work for government payment. I got to know girls there and they ended up liking me for me. I would jokingly flirt as they would too. After 2 months I invited to her birthday party at a club and she come back to my house and ended up staying the weekend.  There was a build up of tension from the flirting before her birthday and would text each other a lot out of work. I remember she had a friend come to our work and they hanged outside while I was loading the truck. I could tell she was getting her friends approval. That night at her party her friend said your going home with him tonight yeah and yeah it just happened. I guess I’m saying try finding a group or a place you can meet people and you be you and it would be less pressure of this dating bs. You know like the old days.  Anyways thought I would share my story hopefully it give you some ideas. In the end we all just want to fit in this world and are playing this game of what we are meant to be and what’s on n not from what society has set.	dr-korbo	reply	na	na	na	0.9987539052963257	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

The double standard that annoys me the most is in subs when men tell other men to improve: diet, go to the gym, build your personality, learn new skills, get a better job.  But I've never heard any improvement advice being told to women as if women are perfect and can't be improved upon only men must improve and change.

Hints are stupid. If someone isn't giving clear signs that they want increased intimacy, that's their fault.

"Dating its like metal detecting in a mine field. It is incredibly nuanced and subjective as to what qualities will be accepted and rejected. Physical attraction plays a massive role but it isn't everything. While there are universal qualities that I feel most people will find attractive there is no one stop list or solution to having a successful date. Here is what has worked for me and what I have learned: 

Alot of people, whatever gender,  I feel really aren't in a place mentally where they are really capable of being a healthy partner to someone. Our earliest examples of what love looks like is shown to us by our parents and alot if us come from broken homes or abusive parents. We seek out in our quest for a partner what we are used to, whether it is toxic or not. I also feel that alot of us are not looking for someone based on our own standards but we are looking for this unobtainable perfect person that checks all the right boxes. Noone can be everything for someone.

In my personal experience I find authenticity, being comfortable in your own skin, and them feeling safe with you to be the best qualities to have to keep someone interested.I feel when you have healed your wounds and are comfortable being you, confidence and humor and all those other things will follow.and you will also start figuring out what you really want in a person and stop trying to embodie these qualities in order to get someone to like you that might not even be good for you anyway. 

Get to know you and figure out what you really want in someone and I think it will eventually fall into place naturally and you won't be so hurt by rejection because those ones weren't the right one.

Thats my two cents anyway, wish you the best friend."	dr-korbo	reply	na	na	na	0.9987539052963257	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
I hear what you are saying, and I thought women are supposed to like transparency these days?  Well maybe not, even so, it does take time to get comfortable with each other to get to this point.  Like others have advised, take the pressure off yourself and be yourself and don't worry and try to fake it.  I would not want a woman who pretends to be something she isn't. Be in activities or groups of your interest and enjoy yourself, someone will notice your joy in doing what you like and it should be easier to relate.  There are women out there in the same boat as you. Ha, my wife noticed my personality, character at a Singles group at Church and approached me.

"The shit sucks fr. I know women that are 240 pounds, autistic, that are damn near agoraphobic that have plenty of options.

I just it was more equitable distribution. I don’t care that there are really attractive men that have a bunch of casual sex or dates or girlfriends. People at the top have options, it is what it is. 

What i hate is that I have a 0.014 match rate on tinder because I’m 5’7, a minority, and have slight asymmetry in my face. 

I’d be cool with a 5%, 10%, 15% match rate because by all means I’m below average and I understand someone finding you attractive doesn’t mean you will be a good fit, but a 0.014 match rate honestly just makes me want to kill myself sometimes. If I swipe on 100 women, 1.4 find me attractive enough to consider being seen out in public with. Holy shit. 

I haven’t even talked about the wining and dining. It doesn’t seem worth it right now.

Another point, women don’t owe men sex (or anything), but men don’t owe women a relationship (or also anything).

"This year has not been good thus far. Probably the worst thus far in my life (but I'm just 21 so I guess there's nothing much prior).

List of failures/somewhat wrong decisions/struggles thus far

- Failed Geotechnical Engineering classes
- Failed Reinforced Concrete Design classes
- Failed to win our football tournament. Dead last in the competition. (Spent like 1k USD for training and uniforms. That's like 3.5 times more than the local minimum wage).
- Lost tenants in our apartment for lease due to bad relationships with the neighbors causing my allowance to not come by as usual
- Certain disconnect with those same neighbors who some were my childhood friends
- Bought a car and apent all my life savings on it and still have some minor issues. Gas is expensive for it and making it borderline unsustainable. (Same car has broken down on me twice in the year I've owned it).
- Being out of favor with my girlfriend's friends (or at least they're annoyed at me)
- Not treating my very supportive girlfriend right which is causing some issues.
- Disconnect with my personal faith. (I believe I am a devout catholic but I think I've been as connected as a forced child to go to church recently. Nothing is really being absorbed).

- My family has been running a business deficit for almost two years now. We can't even meet the bills on time without borrowing money meant for the next month. Our employees aren't getting paid right and we are always on the brink on defaulting loans.


The amount of struggles has just been out of this world for me. I haven't really experienced all these in one go. All that in just 4 months? That's crazy. Academically, socially, financially, and even in my supposed escape of hobby, all are just in a mess. Nothing good. Just what the fuck.

I know God has given me this struggle because part of me believes I can weather it out. But my goodness. Life may struggle more from here, I can sed that. But do I want that? Of course not. Times like this I wish I just die. It doesn't solve anything but at least I don't have to deal with these nonsense. It just really sucks.

How do you even mentally cope when you're broke? I find it really hard to just find a solution then finding out it costs way too much for your own capacity yet it's also how you can alleviate some of the stresses? How do you even stay smart or cope with classes when you're feeling all alone and somewhat having a quarterlife crisis with the career you've chosen 4 years in to the course? So many questions I can't even fathom reasonably placing it all here. 

Some may say I might have a better standing now than what they have but sometimes I even admire them. Like, how do you stay happy given that or their current situation? I wanna know. 

I wanna know how do you even adjust to the simplistic and accepting lifestyle without losing the significant people and stuff you've been accustomed to? Is that even possible?

How do you even cry? Cause I've been trying to but I can't. Even if I really want to."	PaPangaaa	post	24.13678084709327	male	White	0.9994174242019653	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth

"Last night I had to tell my ex that I live with and that I was trying to be friends with that I don't think we can be friends after our lease is up in the fall. And now she's really sad because she doesn't want to lose me from her life, And she thought we were on the same page about being friends. But in reality I was just holding out hope and working on trying to have feelings of just friendship for her but it's not working out for me like it is for her.

Long story short,  we broke up after 2 years together because we both became very mentally ill and we had to work on ourselves separately because we were being bad partners for/to one another. Cut 8 months later to now, I can't seem to get over her at all, no matter how hard I try. 


She is doing a lot better job at moving on and being a fantastic friend to me (She has had access to therapy and psychiatrists our whole relationship through to now because her parents have her double insured, whereas I do not have the money/good insurance for those things to be fair). Basically she's getting help getting over me and is doing a lot better than I at that task, but said she can't see her life without me in it because she really likes me as a person, our mental illnesses just can't be good in a relationship together. 


 I have desperately been trying to change my feelings of affection towards her to feelings of friendship and I just can't do it. I get super jealous because I know she's casually dating and I overheard her say to a friend that she's in a ""hoe phase"" which made me extremely jealous even though I know she has every right to do that. I'm disgusted with myself that I'm THIS jealous because I desperately want to be her friend but my emotions will not let me do that

I've tried so many things to move on that are available to me. I've tried talking it out with friends. I've casually dated and hooked up with women. I have been working out. I work full time. I have tried making new friends, seeing old friends and starting new hobbies. But I'm just so depressed that I'm going to have to give up my FAVORITE person in the world, and the only person in the world that actually likes me for me and the only person or thing that feels like home to me, because I can't see her as ""just a friend"".

I know we can't be together and that hurts me a lot, But what also hurts a lot is not having her in my life at all. And I fucked up her happiness because now she knows we can't be friends. She's sad that I won't be in her life. She was living her life with me as one of her closest friends, and now I went and told her that I can't actually ever see her as ""just a friend"" and that I'm still really not over her/us and ruined that for her.

"Jeez, that's a hard situation. 

First I'm absolutely not surprised you're not over her even after 8 months if you live with her, jeez it took me 1,5 year in some cases to get over an ex, and that's with no contact with them at all...

Secondly it's totally normal you're super jealous and feel absolutely miserable if she hooks up with over people whilst you still have feelings for her.

The first question which comes to my mind, is how come you guys were toxic to each over when you were in a relationship, but not now anymore? Because you still live together, interact with each over on a daily basis. It's basically like being in a relationship but without the sex. So I would have assumed whatever happend whilst you were still in a relationship would still happen now, but seems it doesn't. 

Discarding the past, would you want to get back together with her?

Overall it looks like an honest, ongoing discussion with her seems to be on the cards. I don't know what you have told her but you should basically tell her all what you told us, make her understand that you're still in love and seeing her with other people makes you feel extremely bad. If she really cares about you she'll understand that it would be either being with you, or for the sake of your own happiness and mental health she should give you space rather than subjecting you to mental torture. 

Another thing, even without this issue you're already in need of a therapist, I don't know what kind of job you do, but would you be able to get a job which would provide you with a health insurance to cover a therapist's cost?"

"I hate myself for being unable to talk to people, unable to speak unless spoken to, and unable to connect on a more than superficial level. Sometimes, I think I may be doing OK, but then I see how well everyone else can do it, and I see just how awful and terrible and defective I am. All anyone can say to that is ""don't compare yourself to other people"", as if I'm talking about others having a better car than me, or a bigger house than me, or that they have this cool piece of tech and I don't, when I'm talking about one of the most integral, basic things about being a human, a basic need JUST above food, water, and shelter. Or they say ""it's perfectly fine to be like you are, resign yourself to the horrible, miserable life you have."" (Not in those words).

Clearly, no one gives a shit about this. I'm trying to join multiple support groups about social anxiety and desiring connection, but they aren't answering my calls or my emails.

I also wonder how I'll ever be in a romantic relationship ever if my personality sucks so hard. I want that eventually, even if it's not a current thing I'm focusing on. But what woman would ever want a man who can't talk to her, can't speak his mind, will never speak unless spoken to, and always puts off the housework because he's too busy moping? I can concede that my looks are alright sometimes, and probably will get better as I keep losing weight and can afford better clothes, but my personality sucks ass, and that's ultimately what will get people to want to be with me."

Sex is a basic human need, there is also a portion of men today that will never have sex through no fault of their own because they are simply too naturally unattractive in multiple aspects. I am in this group so I have to die. 

That’s it, unfortunate but a fact of life, some people just aren’t meant to live. 

Before you start commenting “oh but my 5’6 friend gets laid all the time” all you’re doing is proving to me that I am so fundamentally broken that I have to be in the pool of men who will never have sex. 

And it’s not my fault, I’ve done all I can and put in 10x the effort of the average man who gets to have sex like it’s just some normal part of life barely thinking about it.

"You've constructed a mental prison for yourself and you think the only way out is suicide.

For starters, you are the survivor of abuse. That's going to take a while to undo, you need to cut yourself some slack while sorting that all out. Are you in therapy? If not you need to sort that out asap.

Then there are all the other issues:

* I hadn't lost my virginity at 19. When you do you realise it's not that big a deal. You are still young, give it time.

* Sex isn't the most important thing in the world, I know married people who last had sex before you were born. They aren't all just contemplating suicide.

Your height and looks aren't holding you back (as a lot of short, ugly guys can confirm), it's your worldview and that can be changed. I'm not going to lie, it's going to take some hard work on your behalf but it'll be worth it. Suicide isn't a solution, it's just opting out of trying to fix things. Everyone I know who has failed a suicide bid has regretted not reaching out and getting the help they needed, which was waiting right there for them.

"I'm 19 too and might be a little autistic, I'm not sure myself, but general interactions with people are often very taxing and after a while I feel drained, it also feels like I am 'masking' my behavior. I live in a foreign country and have not adapted to the culture or language yet and so feel very out of place, especially when it comes to relationships and such.

I don't use the word cope, because that is not what I do, I thrive, I have learned to realize that there is more to life and everything is so interesting to me and I love learning and exploring. I understand that sex is a basic human need, but masturbation is enough for me.

I have set a lot of goals for myself and my future and want very much to accomplish them and see them through, I am currently reading Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl, and one part really stood out to me;

Instead of searching for meaning and the purpose of life, instead wonder what your purpose is in life, and instead of expecting things from the world, see what the world expects from you.

I have tried finding my own meaning and purpose in the world, and came to the conclusion a few years ago that I wanted to become a psychologist not only to help and understand others, but to do so with myself as well. I have the goal of self-actualization as described by Carl Jung, and this is what I plan to dedicate my life to.

Is that everything you think is getting in the way of having  sex?

You are jumping the gun here by going straight to suicide before you consider any viable solutions to each one of these problems. And yes, there is a solution for each item on your list.

- Annoying demeanor and mental health issues --> Dialectic Behavioural Therapy (DBT) & Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)
- Ugly --> Workout until you have a body of a model, or get a plastic surgery
- Short --> There is a plastic surgery (very painful tho) for that and you can grow 5 inches or more
- Speech issues --> Trauma treatment in therapy can reduce stuttering

"You seem to have built up this doom mentality by acknowledging every flaw in you. This is dangerous because it doesn't consider most of the world is doomed in their own ways and some similar to you. There might not be a way to make we have the same life of the privileged people but there is so much you can try to experience before giving up.

I will give a simple example: try to wear simple and plain clothes that fit you well, get a simple haircut, take careful daily baths and just remove any obstacle in your sex appeal that might make matters worse. Lose/gain weight if you need to, it is hard but doable if you get information/help.

Then you can think of ways to experience sex. Learn about paid sex in your area, get to know pricing, the age of the workers and their appearance. There are plenty of women selling sex that are not any goddesses. Some are old, fat, mentally challanged. There is always one you could feel are not ""better than you"" that would be so disgusted.

I am not saying this is the same of a regular love life and it can most of the times be shitty experiences, but it is a way to experience life. It is real and it gives you the opportunity to feel something or even meet a hooker that will actually try to do a good job for you. Even online you can find girls with fetishes that might want to do some paid stuff.

And I am not also telling you paying is the only way, but in a doom scenario it is a way to be certain of possibility. Don't think you have to die never experiencing stuff. It can be hard to get and it won't be the same but as I said, most of us are not experiencing the good life of the rich and pretty but we can experience a analogues.

"Hey, listen, i don't know will this be the best advice, but i personally think that you want to have sex too much. I feel like you're making a whole reason to live from it, when thats not really the best thing to do, since there is much more to life than just sex, or even than just a romantic relationship. Chasing only sex or even romantic love and making them a whole sense of your life would make anyone collapse and fall. There are friends to be made, our passions that we can expand or discover, whole world to see, and sex doesn't really change or mean anything. It is a way to express our deep love for someone and with someone, but sex itself is just a pleasure, or at least thats how i see it. I really would like to help you, so please tell me more about your perspective and let's just have a talk about it. I'm also a virgin and im 18yo and i don't have any experience into romantic relatioships, but my advice for approaching a girl would be to just try to meet her, become a good friends with her, and then and only then try to get something more if you'd feel that shes the one. At least thats what i would do, i wouldn't try to just get laid or to get up to someone like ""hey you wanna go on a date?"". Unfortunately love is a thing that takes lots and lots of time and patience.

"I've had issues with my marriage in recent years. I won't go into all the issues, but one of them has been that inability of me to express much affection. Over the years my wife has started to remind me of my family. There's any awkwardness there that I can't understand, but it feels verying constraining to the relationship.

I've never had a close relationship with my family. Things aren't bad, but I've just never felt any affection, nor have I felt able to *give* affection. We have a very awkward dynamic and I've learned that there's a very limited number of topics I can discuss with any one of them. I learned years ago that depression was not one of them.

Not that they responded negatively, but when I would go to them for help with my mental health, they would literally only respond with ""well, we support you."" Over and over. And that's it.

I knew they meant well, but it was always disheartening that there was nothing I could say to them that would elicit a more substantive or engaging response. But then I'd just get more frustrated because I would feel like an ungrateful asshole.

I brought up my frustration to a therapist and they just bluntly said ""it sounds like they just aren't going to be very helpful."" In a weird way it was reassuring to hear. It allowed me to let go of a lot of that guilt I felt for not being more grateful to have parents who weren't toxic. I was able to finally let myself think ""your parents are bad at this. It's ok to be disappointed over that. But that's the reality so you need to accept it.""

Today, after a rough week, I finally opened up to my wife about how lonely I've been feeling without any friends. Honestly, I didn't want to get into it with her, but my mood was too down to hide for this past week, and my wife was concerned by how much I was keeping to myself. So I shared with her what had been on my mind, [almost word for word what I wrote in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/131o8t0/not_having_any_friends_is_killing_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

Her exact response: 
""Thank you sharing that with me. I'm sorry you're feeling this way. I am unsure what to say, but please know I love & support you."" 

And that's it.

"Hey bro, I didn't respond to your last post because you said you were not really looking for tips on making friends; you said you knew the available avenues. But DO you know ALL of the available avenues? Have you volunteered anywhere? I know you are busy with work and school, and that you are having trouble keeping up with scheduling with therapy (and you are really over therapy for now), but volunteering is therapeutic AND you can develop meaningful relationships/friendships wherever you volunteer, killing 2 birds with 1 stone. If things aren't working, change it up. It's your mental health on the line. And like the one therapist said:

>""it sounds like they just aren't going to be very helpful.""

Expect that from most people that you meet outside of volunteering, and even some IN volunteering. The world is very selfish, on top of the fact that most have no training on how to actually BE helpful. But that doesn't mean that they are not trainable. That goes for your wife as well. If she is unsure what to do, take the time to find out what she CAN do, and maybe even learn this stuff together with her.

Talking about things will always only get you so far. You need to go get friends. Make the time to do such."	Btown696	reply	na	na	na	0.051148395985364914	weak	no	strong	na	malementalhealth
"Btown, I trust all is well with you. Thinking about your comments, let me share some thoughts on a friend and friendship. First, a friend is a person united with another by feelings of affection, loyal support, and social interaction. You do have this with your wife. The root word friend comes from the Old English word freond, which means “friend, lover, relative,” and freogan, which means “to love.” Again, you have this type of relationship with your wife. Two more definitions of friend are philos, where we get the word Philadelphia, meaning “brotherly love,” and Philanthropy, meaning “the love for man, benevolence.” Another word for friend is companion, a person who associates with and shares in what another is doing and has common interests or experiences. However, companionship does not necessarily mean friendship. 

  
So, what is friendship? A friendship is a reciprocal relationship of liking and loving between two people. Friendship is a mutual emotion based on liking-phileo love. It is the joy of being together, enjoying tender affection between one another. A mature friendship also includes agape love. The Greek word agape means “a commitment to seek the highest good of another” (even when that one has characteristics you do not like). Again, this is a relationship that you and your wife have. 

  
Allow me to define what a casual friendship is. A casual friendship is one of occasional contact, one of common interests and activities (a golf buddy), and some knowledge of accomplishments, abilities, and character qualities. There is a concern for personal problems; there are guarded emotions, but also there is no accountability at this stage. This stage of a friendship is one of getting to know one another. Can you see where I am going with this? A close friendship or relationship comprises regular contact, shared interests, and activities. There is a sensitivity to likes, dislikes, strengths, and weaknesses. There is personal comfort during trials and sorrows, a willingness to become vulnerable, but limited accountability. A committed friendship or relationship is a commitment of quality time to be together, mutual values, and life goals. There is the freedom to help correct character flaws. There is personal involvement in defending reputation, risk of transparency, and mutual commitment with sacrificial love. 

  
Again, this is a description of what you have with your wife; this is what a marriage relationship is supposed to look like. When you married your wife, she became your best friend. What you did by saying your vows was, in effect, a dying to your wants, needs, and desires now to serve her interests, needs, and desires. She has become your priority over all other pursuits. Her best interests are now your interests; helping her become the best person she can be is your goal in life. Just so you do not think I am biased, her life goal is to support your hopes, dreams, desires, and needs and help you become the best version of yourself with her help.  

  
Allow me a few more examples to drive home the point. Here are examples of what causes failed friendships and failed marriages. I do not say this lightly, but your post hints at traveling down a road you do not want to be on; it is as if you are driving down a road at night and your headlights are out. You reach a tunnel, and you cannot see what is coming, nor do you know there is a crash in the tunnel, and if you keep traveling at the speed you are, you will drive right into that crash, injuring yourself and your passengers. I know this analogy is limited, but I believe you will get the point from the following. 

  
The causes for failed friendships and marriages are primarily based on selfishness. Having self-contempt is a starting point: having a poor self-image; being self-centered means being absorbed with one’s own needs and desires. Being self-conscious is being shy, uncomfortable with the attention of others, and being self-deceived, which is not being honest about facts and feelings. Here is one that 100% of the time we all experience, being self-defensive is always justifying one’s actions. Self-pitying is focusing on personal sorrow. Then, there is self-pride, a perfectionistic attitude that leads to being self-righteous and judgmental. Finally, of course, there is self-serving, controlling, and manipulative behavior and the thinking of being self-sufficient, which is not making quality time to nurture friendships and relationships like one’s marriage. 

  
Btown, I do not share all of this with a spirit of negativity or condemnation. I share this from the experience of being in your shoes at one time and realizing that my focus on myself was causing me to experience some very negative thoughts. I will not go into all the abuse I experienced growing up as an abandoned, adopted child that moved multiple times in foster care only to experience physical and psychological abuse that no child should ever go through. I survived, but not because I focused on me. I recognized the inner, outer, and upward relationships in my life as I grew older and needed a change of direction. Also, understand my apparent overly sense of placing my wife on a pedestal. I have not placed her above my upward relationship; however, I have realized that my best friend in this life is first upward, second outward, and third inward. I am last in my relationship. If I place myself first above all, which is what the philosophy of this world promotes, I will display every single self-absorbed behavior I cited above. 

  
My last thought is this. If I wished I had friends who gave me feelings of belonging, made me feel significant, and unconditionally loved without wanting to change me, they would be analogous to robots without free will. But if I have the upward friendship whose love is always unconditional, but because of this upward love for me, he is not willing to leave me as I am but plans to change me through my friendships, family, and most often through marriage relationships. I then find that my significance will not be found in getting friendships but in giving friendships. Also, my inner joy will be found in serving and befriending others as an extension of the upward love I receive. 

  
Btown, I trust and hope my thoughts will be an encouragement. I can share more with you if you like. I can share some do’s and don’ts to being a friend concerning other relationships other than your wife. However, as much as I would say this is advice, it is not. It is what I learned from not being a friend upward, outward, and inward. Well, until I see a reply, be well."	Btown696	reply	na	na	na	0.051148395985364914	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"I've attended more than a few of these and there's always at least one gem that I didn't already know so it's worth giving them a try even if you've already tried therapy or other stuff like this like I have.   


If you need it you can even get certificates of attendance as long as you fill out their little satisfaction and demographic surveys at the end, and while you can't get the certificate if you miss the live session, they automatically email you the recorded version if you miss it live.   


They cover different topics all the time but you can use their survey to request topics if you don't see your issue(s) covered.

"I have always been into girls since I was a kid. But I had many unsuccessful attempts and I have some traumas which make it very difficult to form a relationship. One could say I am afraid of it. But still, I had a very strong desire for girls. I had a few short relationships.

At one point however, I started to wonder what it would be like to be blown by a guy (only by feminine types). I started to watch porn in this theme. Then I tried it. It felt awkward. But eventually I tried it some more times. Each time it felt awkward before and after. It felt wrong to be next to a guy naked.

Somehow it feels wrong when I do it in real life. But I can get very excited watching it in porn. And that's the problem. Somehow it turned me bi and very strangely I can feel that it changes the way I look at girls. Somehow I am getting less interested and more picky with them.

I am scared to death. This changes my whole image of myself. I have always wanted to get married, have kids, etc. To have a romantic relationship. I have so many plans about the things I want to do with the girl I love. But I am so worried it will never happen. This is crazy. I have suicidal thoughts because of this. I am not a teen, I am 30 now. This should not be happening."	Expensive_Meet222	post	22.636287366191734	female	White	0.025339316576719284	na	na	na	10	malementalhealth
"As a proud bi man, I’m not gonna shame you for how you feel and do some virtue signal bullshit. The reason I’m not going to is because your experience is EXACTLY my journey to understanding my sexuality. There is nothing wrong with your feelings and thinking porn changed you. I will agree with the other homies who have commented so far and say, I think you’re bi but not romantically. Romantically it seems like you lean “straight” but your turn ons can also include men. I see my sexuality this way. I could never date a man or marry him but I LOVE sexual experiences with men/trans women. I’m happily married to a woman. We plan to have kids. All I can say is, accept how you feel and understand there is nothing wrong with you. There are other dudes like you. 

Don’t think your affinity to hard dicks is bad, or whatever your exact attraction is. Sexuality is a spectrum for everyone, in my opinion. So just enjoy the journey. 

Oh also - BE PICKY WITH POTENTIAL PARTNERS. I tried to date so many girls that were “below” my standards and it never worked. I thought there was something wrong with me. There wasn’t I just hadn’t found the right one. When I did - super easy to be in a relationship.

Sexuality is not as concrete as it's often made out to be, and there exists a wide range of places on that spectrum of where people could end up. It's very possible that you enjoy watching gay porn but don't want to actually do that in real life, and it sounds like that's the case since you said you experimented with men and you didn't enjoy the outcome of that. My girlfriend will mix in lesbian porn a fair amount but she has zero desire to have a sexual encounter with a woman. I've asked her and she, like you, said she did experiment once in college but didn't go all the way through with it because it just didn't feel good for her. There are plenty of people out there like that, and there's absolutely nothing wrong or shameful about that.	Expensive_Meet222	reply	na	na	na	0.025339316576719284	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

when I do any progress my mind goes mind-wandering and imagine myself happy after achiving it and telling people how I achived it. after that I Think I don't deserve all of this and this thoughts are making me quit and stop doing anything. example when I was at an exam and I'm solving pretty well then my mind commented ""oh really, I did this? Imagine telling others this experience and the outcomes"" after that my mind became full of blames and negative thoughts about self-worth. and thinking that I'm unworthy to achieve that stuff.

As for some weight-loss advice; it is all about Calories In vs Calories Out.

An unconventional thing that I've been doing lately which has helped me lose 2-3kg in the past few weeks is M&Ms. I have a moderately active life-style, and get around 5000 steps per day whenever I'm walking, and besides that I do some weight lifting. But I eat a lot, often, and also snack in between meals.

So to fight and counter my snacking behavior, I always fill a shot glass with M&Ms and keep it next to my desk, whenever I have the urge for snacks, I take one M&M in my mouth and just let it melt, I do not bite on it, and most of the time I don't even finish the glass the whole day, because I am distracted by other things and don't have as much urges. Going by the label on the packet, I'm probably eating around 200-500kcal of M&Ms on average (which is far better than me going straight to the fridge and binge eating) ,  I also try to eat less and less of it each day, and try to fight the urges and build up a tolerance, it has gotten to the"	Monked800	reply	na	na	na	0.9993416666984558	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

Well this is probably like the blind leading the blind but I’ve made some progress in the fear or mortality area. Some things that helped me where making a self care/to do list. Like everything I need to do for the day from brushing teeth to working. Check the list everyday. Walk or exercise. “Try” to put all my focus and effort into things I can control. I figured if I’m going to be miserable all the time I might as well pick the miserable shit that will give me and my family I’m blessed to have a better shot at a good future. If your doing unhealthy things try to work on changing them. Acceptance is huge accept what you can’t change and accept honestly what you can. Way harder to do than it sounds though. On the bright side their are so many good people in this world and so many wonderful things. I guess death gives life meaning we will all die there is nothing to do about it. But since I’ve became someone I can love( very hard to do but totally worth it) I have a peace like I have never known before. Life is far from perfect but we are capable you are enough to make it better than we ever dreamed. Plan for your future but live in the now.

"Well, what needs to change? What is in your life now that you wish it wasn't? What do you wish was in your life that isn't now? Make note of them. I find it helps to write them down.

Once you can answer these questions, you have to think about what it would take to make the changes you want. Think each one through, think about the effort, time, cost etc. Involved with making each change to get what you want. 

Once you have an idea of what it would take to get each one, you can decide whether it is worth pursuing that change. I can think of millions of things I would like, but I don't deem a good use of my time, effort, or resources. I would love to speak a second language, for example, but for the use I would get out of it, it would not be worth the time required to gain that skill. So we can say that desire is not enough alone to warrant the pursuit of something. 

Once you know which changes would be worth pursuing, expand on how you are going to get it. Once you have done this, you have a plan. It is important to carry out the previous steps before making your plan, otgerwise you plan will be misguided, and you won't have the motivation to follow the plan. To have motivation to do something, you need a motive to do it and to have a motive to do it, you need to understand why you want it. 

So you now know what you want, why you want it, what it would take to get it, and you have determined which of your ideas are worth pursuing and you are now making a plan. Look at your ideas and try to split the ideas into three categories: achieveable next year, next 3 year, next 5year+. Plan the ins and outs of what you need to do to get what you want and then set about getting it.  Your plan should not rely on things that are entirely out of your control. You can aim for these things, but your happiness should not rest entirely on these things.

Life only has the meaning that you give it. Personally, I think the purpose of life is simply to enjoy it. Your experience of life and view on what it should be like is entirely selfish; everyone is the main character in their own life.

I think of life as a game of suffering. You either suffer to get what you want, then enjoy the rewards, or you suffer the consequences of not suffering to get what you want and don't enjoy life. Find what you want, figure out what is going to give you a motive to get up everyday, figure out what a life which would really make you happy looks like, and then go about getting it. 

Other tips: 

1. realise the difference between happiness and fun. Some people try to make themselves happy by having fun, but it is often a hollow, temporary distraction from what you are really missing. 

2. Take stock of what you do have, which is good. Don't just think about what you want to change. Think about what you already have, too. Remind yourself of what you have to be thankful for."	RoundOk651	reply	na	na	na	0.9992434978485107	no	no	strong	na	malementalhealth
"Sorry to hear. I know how much that sucks.

What you describe is all too familiar and sounds like symptoms of depression. I've fought depression for years and in the low periods I feel like this. 

In my case I seem to have a chemical imbalance. There is no acute source of depression, it is more like my brain's default. So I also have been taking medication for depression for a number of years which has helped me. 

I also do a lot better when I go outside in the sun occasionally and much better when I exercise some (even walking around the block daily). I also do better if I have and see friends once in awhile.

It gets tough when you get too depressed to want to bother doing any of the things that would help. Eventually, I manage to force myself to do something and then claw my way back out and do ok for a while. 

It always gets better. But it's a huge pain in the ass.

"So something I’ve come to realize about myself is I’m not really going to be good at working and managing my mental instability. Every job I have had I end up hating and being on the verge of snapping and killing someone with my bare hands. Things just never seem to work out and no one seems to be friendly in the sense of being able to work and not feel like it’s an actively hostile workplace. 

My best guess is I’ll end up becoming an alcoholic to deal with the excuse of life I’m going to have (already changed my major to something that suits me best, previous job was painful and I wanted to kill my boss with a passion, also realized how much I am different than everyone else unfortunately in the area I live in). 

I’ll probably end up blowing my brains out because I’ve been institutionalized twice and last time I went into the hospital I ended up being worse off. The only thing that helped were the meds, that place was a hellhole and I promised myself I’d die before I ever had to be dragged back there again. I will die before I’m forced into a cage and treated like an animal along with other people who clearly need to be isolated and not just put into general mental care and are making the whole situation worse.

I’ve been in college for the last two years and things have gone ok besides the previous job where I grew to hate the boss and the entire shop environment he curated. 

I’m extremely anxious that this next job is going to be shit, and I’m going to hate life again. I really am not looking forward to yet another summer of hatred and resentment for being alive. Just want to find a place I can work at and not want to kill everyone including myself so maybe I can have a chance at life.

Problem is that my track record indicates this won’t happen. I’m just so fucking fed up with trying to have a normal life and be a productive member of society, but getting so worked up with shitty working environments and my mind being so hard on myself that anger and suicidal depression are the only feelings I have. I just don’t see any type of good ending to my life. 

Honestly I think suicide, when it will happen to me, will be a better way of going out rather than living a life in constant pain or being dragged back to the nuthouse and being objectified again."

I’m not 6 foot but when I worked on myself and hit the gym, and worked on some other things I became unrecognizable. I got a lot of female attention. I was being treated differently because I was more attractive. I gained respect from other men, and I gained attention from women that I never thought I could get. It kind of mentally fucked me up. I went from unattractive to incredible handsome. Now, I’m working myself to be that handsome person I remembered. I can’t just give up bro. There’s more to life than getting laid. Yes, it feel so damn good but after a while sex doesn’t feel good with strangers you just meet.

If reading about sex online makes you feel super shitty, GET OUT OF THOSE SPACES. Do literally anything but go into those spaces, watch netflix, play video games, go on a walk to let off steam, join a community sports team, draw, volunteer, learn a new skill. There's so much to do in life besides focusing so much on sex. Addiction is horrible and I wouldn't want anyone to fall into that. Until you've been through addiction, you can't fully conceptualize how much worse it will make you're life. You won't just be sad about being a virgin, you'll be sad about being a virgin AND an alcoholic. 

 I've seen you post about your situation on many subs and I feel like posting about being virgin is just making it worse, because you're inviting the conversation about sex, a conversation specifically about YOUR sex life, not just a stranger's. People online can be brutal when it comes to venting about being a virgin because sex isn't a right. Yeah it can feel really ostracizing but people online aren't gonna be super empathetic about it. 

Strangers online cannot give you good, personalized advice, that's why online dating advice seems so shitty. The things that work for me and other guys won't work for you because we are different people, in different situations. So when giving/recieving advice to online we are left to give/recieve generalized advice that works well in most situations."

While I may no longer suffer from all the depressive days, I feel I'm still lost. I've lost interest in everything I used to love. I tried loving it again but I couldn't feel the spark anymore. 

I used to love traveling. I tried traveling yesterday after a really long time. I hated it. I ended up getting off the bus after 30km and returned home.

I used to love being in a crowd and conference. I went to a movie recently and being in middle of so many people outside the theatre after the movie was extremely unnerving.

I used to love writing. I tried writing for a lot of days. I couldn't write anything. My mind had never been this blank.

I used to love learning new things. I hate it now. I have to drag myself in most cases because I have to complete the mandatory courses my employer assigned.

I used to love working with computers. Now I don't even want to touch one if I can.

By what you describe it souns more like brain chemistry issue than something you can talk out. Are you seeing a mental health professional who can prescribe medication? For me it is related to anxiety, so medication mostly helps to keep that in check. For you it sounds like anhedonia, can't comment much on it, but if I were you I will try to get medication prescribed to help cope and work with doctor if any adjustments needed.

I mean...you're 24. Even if you are currently worthless (and I doubt you're worthless, but I'll meet you there), you don't have to continue to be worthless. That's something you can change, but you have to make that decision and you have to take the steps to follow through with becoming not worthless. Your life isn't over nor is it anywhere close to being over. I'd agree with your therapist that depression is probably influencing that decision, but that's not particularly helpful. If you're not taking meds, I'd suggest trying some meds. If you're already taking meds, I'd talk to your doctor about what meds you're on and their dosage. But at the end of the day, you're the one piloting the ship. You can look for the good and the positive and find reasons to be less miserable or you can look for the bad and the negative and use that to continue your worthless narrative.  I have treatment resistant depression and I've lived in that hole. It's awful. It's easy to fall into and hard to get out and it is, to some extent, a decision on how you deal with it. I'll tell you a trick that helped me when I was in the deepest pit and thinking about suicide pretty regularly. Every day, I came up with 3 good things.

"So... what is the question here? What are you asking us? To give you a confirm like ""yeah, you definetly are worthless and you will never find love, no doubt about it"". Bro, we don't even know you, and by the way what would be the point of receiving this confirmation? Now, let's get rational (or at least try to). The first thing you said was ""I'm worthless and will never find love"". The first question is about the verb you used. ""I'm worthless (right now)"". Do you have any proof that this is what you are doomed to be? If even you are worthless now, how do you know that you will forever be worthless? You time travelled and saw yourself in the future? The other thing that you said was ""I will never find love"". This is less ambiguos about the time, like you know that the fact you're worthless and undeserving of love is something that can't change. But again, how could you know that? We don't know what will happen in the future, and that is not to say ""hey! cheer up, future is gonna be bright and awesome somehow"", which is total bs, and I understand your frustration when people give you that kind of message. It's vague and unhelpful, and it doesn't answer the question ""how? what will happen that will make things better?"" But the main point is that you don't know the future, and one of the main thing that you don't know about the future is what your actions will be, because that is something you can't predict for the exact reason that you will decide what actions you'll take in the future. Now you might be thinking ""my actions don't matter, they have too small of an impact to make a difference, or they don't make any difference at all"". That is partially true, our actions have a small impact if we compare them to all the other external forces that shape our lives. We don't decide where we are born, the family we have, the school we are sent in, the people we'll meet there, we don't decide our trauma and any other mental or medical condition we have to endure. But still, we can still ask ""what can I do for myself?"" Given all the things that I can't change, what are the things that I can do? What can I decide to do that doesn't depend on everything or anyone else? Because as small as the impact of our actions may seem, our actions are the only things we can control, and that, actually, can be way more impactful than you think. Even if you say ""There's nothing I can do"" that's actually a lie. There are decisions we take every day, from what to eat, when, when to go to sleep, if we pick up a book, if we decide to look for a job (even with no cv, they might reject us but they can't prevent us from looking for a job), the things we decide to learn. And the thing is, the more you work on your actions and your decisions on what actions to take, the more the impact of your actions will grow.     
Now, let's make a step foward. One thing that those people around you probably are not getting, is that not only is pointless and unhelpful to just say ""you'll be fine, things will get better, you will find love"", it's also pointless to say ""do something, take actions or nothing will ever change"" (which, to be honest, is more or less what I've told you so far: take action). The point is, it's useless to tell someone ""take your responsibility"" or ""do something about it"" if the person we're speaking to doesn't know what to do, doesn't know what actions to take and can't think of any. But at this point we may have understood another thing: it is not like you can't do anything about your condition, it's that you don't know what to do about it... YET! So maybe we have a starting point: drop the mentality that tells you there is nothing that can be done, start from the assumption that you can do something for yourself. Take it like a dogma, because even if this isn't true and there really is nothing you can do, the only way you can find out is by trying a lot of different things, and even when you start thinking ""there's nothing I can do, I've tried everything"" just assume (again, like a dogma) that there are other things you can try, they just haven't come to your mind yet. Now, I'm deeply sorry I can't tell you where to start, because I don't know anything about your situation, but you have to at least assume there are things you haven't tried and they might work, even if they take time. And to be honest, if you're 24 I really doubt you've tried everthing possible to fix your problems. How do I know? Because I'm fucking 32 and I still never had a relationship or found love and I still struggle with feeling worthless. I''ve been dealing with this for ten years (that's when I realized problems wouldn't fix themselves, I had to do something about it). And guess what, there are a lot more things I haven't tried yet, and I've been trying to do A LOT of things. But if I were to make a list of all the things I've tried and all the things I have yet to try, the second would be hundreds times longer that the first. At this point, some people think ""WHAT? 32?! You're telling me it might take this much time to fix my problems?"" Yes, it can definetly take time, and there's no way to know how much time will it take to see improvements. Now, speaking of me, I'm still far from where I want to be, but I'd be lying if I say things haven't got better in these years. I've learned A LOT, and a lot of things have gotten better, some have gotten a bit worse, I discovered some other problems I didn't know I have and I'm still working on it. The point is, I'm still learning, I've learned and improved a lot and I have still so much to do. And let's not forget that now I have tons of resources that simply didn't exist when I was 24: books that haven't been published, youtube channels that didn't exist (search HealthyGamerGG on youtube and watch all of his videos, Dr K is exeptionally good at what he does), authors I didn't know, websites, chat gpt  (which is optimal for finding books), library genesis, coaches, speakers etc. You already have those tools if you have internet (which you do), now you need to take time to explore them: learn new topics that might be helpful, read, try new things, look around for what you haven't tried yet or what you still have to understand. That's all that you can do, but I swear it can do all the difference in the world.   
One last note: ""I know myself better than anyone"". Sorry to say it, but that's bullshit. Again, you're 24 and you think you've already learned all about yourself? Self awareness is something that takes decades of introspection to master, and it usually doesn't result in conclusions like ""I'm worthless and I'll never find love"", because there's a lot more to say about an individual than the things he can't do right now, his failures or what seems impossible to him at the moment. Again, I've tried to understand myself for 10 years and I still have a lot of work to do. If you have figured it all out at 24, I am the one asking you how do you learn all about yourself in such a short time? Let's all remember that we don't know what we don't know, and start from there.

But if I keep it light and just ""contribute"" then I am welcomed. Idk I feel like I am half a Machievell and half a Sociopath because I try my best to make my ""moves"" count socially.

With dating? Forget it. Too much risk and I am just an average white dude slowly going into his 30s. If women want me, then they should be obvious because now it seems women are not really women but a lesser version of a man, if that makes sense. Women aren't being top women.

As for friends? I think I got the hang of it but it is all surface and cliche stuff. I get it won't get me ""closer"" but it's fine because I wouldn't want them to use my weaknesses against me.

"Hi, I (16M) have been unpacking lots of potential abuse lately and I think a lot of people I’ve talked to don’t understand the dynamic of what happened. My mom is pretty narcissistic, as well as my sister who is four years older, and both of them definitely don’t respect boundaries. And from ages maybe 7-14 our mom would grab, touch, and spank us “playfully” and my sister who is 4 years older eventually started doing this to me because she knew it made me uncomfortable and could pick on me with it. She also would sit on my lap, twerk, etc for the same reason. When both me or my sister would tell my mom to stop touching our butt or legs she’d ask why or say we’re being sassy. When I told her it made me feel uncomfortable and affected me, her response was “I’m sorry you feel that way” and then she’d talk about how it made her feel and say things like “I guess my feelings don’t matter though”. 

This next example isn’t physical but just another example of lacking boundaries, she has an iPad hooked up to my phone to receive and monitor ALL of my messages and sometimes she’ll even send messages on my behalf. 

I know it’s really hard to convey the dynamic of a family in a post, but I can’t help but think that I wouldn’t have as many people telling me what happened was normal if I was a female. I feel awful saying that but just imagine if instead of (16M) it was (16F). I hate people saying that this is just playing or there was no bad intent so how could it have bothered you? I don’t know I guess I’m just ranting. My grandma on my moms side is also pretty nuts as well as my moms two sisters.  

I developed hypersexuality very early, maybe 7 or 8, I have OCD, I flinch anytime my family comes near me, I have had a slew of eating disorders and body image issues, obviously anxiety and depression, and I just generally hate what I am.

"Ik u still live there and what not but my mom and dad were kinda the same way. My dad would talk about his sex life with other women (my mom and dad separated when I was 5) but my dad thought he was so cool telling me all this shit. He always snapped on my phone and just overal would like be a weirdo. Asking for kisses on the lips and what not even tho he didn't take care of his teeth let alone himself. My mom grounded me all the time and didn't give a fuck about us unless it was like Christmas or something. Getting us presents in stead of love was her way of justifying never giving a hug or helping with home work. And the one boyfriend she had was a lunatic who drank all the time and smoked Crack. I personally remember he poured ketchup on his bare chest the one day and like chased me and smeared it on me. My mom laughed and thought it was funny but it was literally fucking insanity and mortifying. She got away from him but her now husband is like the mix of that guy and my dad. Talks about how he sleeps with my mom, gas light central with that guy. He literally talked and cried about how great of a grandfather he was gonna be to my son. But ik if I has a girl he wouldn't of gave a shit. All VERY uncomfortable. Always made hidden but not so hidden comments about my fiancé. My mom never said shit to him about any of it. So GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I don't talk to either of my parents anymore. And I don't think I ever will. They fucked up my whole childhood. 

Please my dude. They might be blood and that makes them feel like they r owed something from that. But overall u didn't ask for this, or to be born or for those fuckers to be ur family. One day u can get away and cut them out and u will still think about what they did to u but ALL they think about is ""What did I do so wrong"" bc they r to stupid and to oblivious to see it. Or just straight up don't want to see it. GET AWAY WHEN U CAN AND GET THERAPY. Don't try to hide how u feel. It always comes back to haunt u so much deeper then the first several hundred times u think about it. It just gets worse with no help. Handle it. Let it fuel u to show them who the fuck u r.

That's a tough way to go through life and I hope you can find the peace you need to make it at least bearable.   You hint at past trauma.  Are you in therapy for any of this?  I used to feel something similar. For me it was an overwhelming feeling of guilt and shame stemming from sexual abuse when I was a teenager.  I felt like I was less of a person than everyone else and I was undeserving of any love from others.  Good therapy helped me work through those feelings and begin to value myself a bit more.

"I can’t get a therapist that actually wants to talk to me. It always gets to the same place: I open up about what’s going on and then they say they can’t treat this so I should go to a different therapist. This has happened more than 10 times. I don’t trust these scammy therapists. No matter how many recommendations I’m given they’re all lying pieces of shit. They never help me. They just pawn me off to a different therapist once we develop any kind of groundwork.

I do not know what I’m going to do. I never get anywhere with therapy. My most recent therapist just told me they couldn’t work with me yesterday. The biggest reason I struggled to open up to her was because I was worried she would do exactly this, she told me she wouldn’t get scared, and she still fucking did it! We’d been seeing each other for 10 weeks and finally covered my background. How am I supposed to trust them? They’re so expensive. What exactly am I paying for?

I’m incredibly suicidal but if I go to a hospital they say I’m not suicidal enough. If I go to a therapist they say they can’t treat me. This last therapist was trained in EMDR and DBT with over 10 years of experience. 

I tried. I really tried but i think I’m at my end. There is no one to help me. Finding a new therapist takes 100s of hours for me. At this point I can only tell my life story once a year. It’s too draining otherwise. I don’t have it in me to keep repeating myself over and over. 

Will probably kill myself soon.

"The last few days I’ve been in a sedated state, feeling like a zombie not really functioning and just feel unlike any other. 
I self harmed the other night in the hopes that the external side of me would show the internal side of me, I spent years searching for something more than what I was feeling, hoping that someone someday would say babe I know your hurting. 
People see it all as attention seeking, even pushed my mum out of my life just to feel something other than what’s going on. I just hurt others while also hurting me, only thing is I hurt me physically and the others emotionally. Doubting every little inch of my inner being to be something I’m not. 
They talk about doing therapy and how it will help but it’s actually having the courage to open up and feel the hurt deep within and be okay to not be okay that I struggle with, don’t get me wrong my therapist is awesome and she gets me on a whole other level. Depression is a silent killer but I have to fight it every day to not let it win. 
Courage is something different when the internal pain is so intense that you can’t make the external match, I don’t cut for attention just like I don’t purge for attention or attempt suicide for attention, I do these things because I don’t know how else to scream out Help me I’m hurting. 
Someone once described BPD as a patient with 3rd degree burns every ounce of movement aches more and more at the slightest touch it hurts.

"I used to feel the same way- and largely still do.

But then one day someone told me ""I hate when people get mad at other people for seeking attention.

And I realized I was depriving myself of literal human connection all because I dident want to be needy. 

Want attention. It doesn't always mean what people say, There's nothing wrong with feeling lonely, disconnected, depressed, and hurt. But trust me having a good cry with the people you care about can change everything. It's not about forcing yourself to feel (and in sorry you feel like you had to hurt yourself in order to do that.)

"I lived on my own for a large chunk of my life.  Yeah, you're right, it does suck being alone so much of the time.  Regardless of how big or small your home is (apartment, duplex, house, whatever), it can almost seem like a prison at times, especially on those days when you're low on cash.  My ways to deal with it were to get out and drive around sometimes, or to distract myself through work, hobbies, or even IRC.  Lucky me, I've worked in IT since my 20s and I was able to chill in my living room with a beer, cartoons, and my laptop working tickets when I was really bored and too much into my own head.  Sometimes I'd drive up to Walmart to wander around just for some human interaction and a change of scenery.  Family time is good if you get along with your family.  But seriously, don't dwell inside your own head too much for too long when you're on your own like that, it will seriously damage your mental health.  I ended up starting to like the solitude (maybe a little too much).  Now in my 40s, I still have a certain level of social anxiety, I hate large crowds (though I like the ability to disappear into them), and I greatly value my ""me time"" alone.

Bottom line, find a balance.  SOME balance.  Just don't try to do it all alone, cause in this life, you really can't.  Find some friends.  You don't need many, but the ones you find, make sure they're the right friends.

"Loneliness in itself isn't the issue. Lonely is a particular emotion we feel when certain needs go unmet and don't align with our expectations for relationships. 

The challenge is deconstructing want vs need and how expectations and conformity to social norms impact that. 

Having needs that go unmet long term hurts. There are a lot of ways the need behind the need can be met once we open our minds and truly work on the issues that cause our needs and desires to go unmet. 

Because there are lots of needs that lead to loneliness. Desire for mental and emotional connection and support. Desire for intimacy. Desire for acceptance or approval. And how we think those desires should be met and being unfulfilled when things don't work out like we expect 

I say this as someone who has experienced harrowing loneliness as well as deeply fulfilling connection and relationships.  I say this as an autistic person who has had to  do a lot of extra work to figure out how to connect with others in meaningful ways. I say this as a person with multiple mental health conditions that require me to be on meds for the rest of my life and as someone who has spent years in and out of therapy. I say this as someone who has watched my brother, my father, friends and lovers struggle with deep feelings of loneliness even though they had people in their lives, and still banged their heads against walls with their beliefs about themselves, self isolating and creating self fulfilling prophecies of loneliness by shutting people out.

The problem of loneliness starts in your own head with your own expectations and all the issues and baggage that go along with it. Depression is not only a symptom of loneliness it's often the cause of it and so many men have undiagnosed and untreated depression and keep wondering when will they stop hurting and life  have meaning and fulfillment. 

Work on your issues with a professional, get on meds and figure out how to be content in your own company...because when your own company is all you have, you have to face the glaring truth of who you are as an individual and we are so often flawed and have so many issues that keep us getting in our own way. And we have to face the truth that we are not the people we think we are, or don't like the kind of person we are. But those are things we can change. It just takes time and dedication and usually meds and therapy because its really hard and really stressful navigating that territory alone and we need the support. 

And not having it is why we wallow in escapist tendencies and self pity because it's so much easier than putting in the work to change ourselves.

And the trouble there is truly honestly wanting to change and wanting to put the work in, and with so many of us feeling like we don't actually deserve happiness and have massive self image and self esteem issues, and not wanting help, feeling like being lonely is weakness and asking for help us weakness and opening ourselves to being vulnerable is weakness....and you have to be open to help, to advice to being honest with yourself and being vulnerable, to understand that a lot of the things we believe are flawed and need to change for us to find happiness in ourselves by being our most authentic self, not what we think we should be or what society or our peers think we should be for therapy to have any real lasting influence.

Try make more physical contact with people. This will trigger the release of oxytocin (aka the “love” hormone), that makes us feel more engaged with others.

"Hey I get your in a really rough spot right now. I would recommend avoiding things that focus on sex and relationships where possible and practical for awhile. Stay off social media where it's every where for a bit.  

Make playlists and show lists where these things aren't portrayed. There actually is stuff out there without it. Though  it can be hard finding stuff at times it's definitely there.  Focus on a hobby, something you do just for you that has nothing to do with attracting a potential partner. 

I've gone through periods like this when my depression used to get really really bad. The depression lessens eventually even if it doesn't go away. Time and support in person from friends helps a lot of you've got a good social circle. But just making a choice to not be in spaces where all the sex and relationships feel like they are being shoved in your face and down your throat for a couple weeks can help.

You have to dedicate your life to attracting women otherwise you’re a lazy entitled neck beard who deserves to be alone, but also just don’t try and actually trying makes you desperate which is a turn off. Simply do nothing and women will flock to you! 

Be confident, like full narcissist you are a perfect person and everyone is beneath you. If you don’t think that then sorry sweetie but no one wants an insecure guy, YUCK! But also you need to be hypercritical of all aspects of your self and have no self esteem otherwise you’re an entitled “nice guy.”

Looks don’t matter but have you tried doing everything in your power to be as attractive as possible?

You’re not actually allowed to want sex, women will “smell that” (the phrase they always use) and hate you for it 

Make friends with them first! But not for the end goal of a relationship or at least sex because again they’ll smell that and hate you. 

Don’t be lonely, they’ll smell that and hate you.

"It is contradictory because humans are paradoxical creatures, and because it comes from multiple sources : nobody wants the same thing, and everyone will tell you what they want for themselves. And that might be the polar opposite of what the previous person said.

You will never be able to attract everyone. You shouldn't even try. So what should you do? You should seek to understand what you want. What are the things you would find unacceptable? What are the things you actually wish for? Try figuring that out first and foremost.

Then, courting people is a really tricky thing. It's subtle and can be really awkward when it fails. Most people actually practice that skill in their teens, with other teens. The awkwardness is geneeal and kind of expected, and people improve along others of their generation. 

If you miss that, it becomes harder, because people have come to expect people their ages to have grown more proficient. It means you will have to try to practice that, and at first, that will be awkward, and you will be rejected. Being rejected is okay. It is not an indictment of your value as a human being. You may even find someone who actually doesn't care or appreciate your quirks. You can try joining clubs like theatre, improv or tabletop rpgs. Those are things in which you are expected to play social situations, with low consequences if you fail and where it is expected that you might not be the greatest at first. It gives you room to improve.

The other option is lots and lots of social activities. It gives you chances at meeting new people, and at practicing social skills.

Usually, courting involves some amount of putting yourself out there as a sexual being, and it is better to do it relatively early. It might be through various means, clothing, jokes, attitudes, etc. The trick is to find the appropriate middle. If you are the embodiment of asexuality, you will never be considered as a potential partner. If all you exude is sexuality and only that, it will be pretty repulsive. The appropriate level depends a lot on context, on what you yourself are comfortable with, and will attract some people but not others.

"Okay my man. Don't take the following things as offensive, but i'm gonna gove you a counter-perspective.

Let me get out the biggest overarching thing first: the stuff you wrote for the most part isn't contradicting. And you know why? Because it's not an either-or decision. Most of the things are a spectrum and the right approach is usually not on either end, but instead around the middle. It's about finding a balance. Most people struggle with either end, so they recommend the other, that's how much of this advice comes to be. And because of that, it's skewed by peoples' own opinions. Doesn't make it wrong per sé though. 

Let's go through the things you mentioned one by one:

There is a difference between getting yourself out to meet people and ""dedicating your life"". Conversing with people around you (or swiping a few profiles if it's more your thing). 
Of course not doing anything at all isn't a great strat, it's gonna make you look uninterested. People won't think you are looking to date if you aren't at least activated. But it's about not looking like that's the only thing on your mind. Do you have hobbies, a job/study, interests? There's gotta be more than just dating on your mind. Saying that dating is ALSO one of the many things you are persuing is not being what i'd consider dedicating your life

Show me any non-bullshit article that tells you to be a narcissist. And trust me, I myself am currently crushing on someone so i'm probably reading the same articles you read. And i didn't see that anywhere. Most of them particularly state: be confident but not arrogant. In other words... Be a well-adjusted human being. Being insecure and only wallowing in that the first time you meet a girl, of course that's deterring. If a girl only talked about how she hates everything about herself and how i can't possibly find her attractive, it is gonna be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Being a do-no-wrong narcissist is just as bad. But how about saying ""Hey, i'm comfortable with who i am. I like these things about me. But there's also things i'm trying to work on""? Doesn't sound too bad, eh?

Looks don't matter is of course bullshit. And most people know that. But people still have a lot of leeway. I'm not a model by any means. I'm a 4/10 when i get out of bed. But i'm making it a habit to take care of myself. Showering, brushing teeth, some perfume, shaving. And then some nice-fitting clothes and boom. On a good day, i can be a 7/10 once all that is done. Nothing to write home about but easily a step-up.

""don't be interested in sex"". Again, where'd you read that? I usually saw the other side more often: Treat sex as normal. Don't be too stuck about it. Don't make it some holy thing that women can't possibly be interested in. Just don't talk about it 24/7. In other words again, talk like a normally-adjusted being. You know sex is part of a relationship. They know. So don't treat it as untouchable if the situation is appropriate. Just don't go to the other end to talk about it innapropriately.

Make friends i think is more about not running down their door with romantic desperation. Do make your intentions clear somewhat early, preferably already through the way you interact. Recently I met with a classmate of mine for the first time. And I decided to put on a bit of (fake) confidence and behaved a bit flirty. Not too much, just some light flirty behaviour to see how she reacts. And now while we are technically friends, the stage is kinda set and we are always in a bit of a flirty behaviour. I never told her that i ""desperately want to be with her"" or anything of the sorts. That would be way toooo on the nose. But realistically, she half-way knows herself.
And that's kind of how to treat it when you meet someone new. Don't drop straight on the nose, but be comfortable with keeping a flirty ambiguous mood if you are interested in more than friends and then gradually step it up over time. That whole time you guys are ""only friends"". But you both know the precedent

The loneliness stuff goes back to confidence vs insecurity
And the sex thing i also discussed above

"Confidence is not thinking you're the best of the best, it's acting in a way that aligns with your personal values. In this way, you are assured that any actions you take are in accordance with what you want and thus you can act confidently. Maybe start by evaluating and refining what is important to you.
Insecurity is your responsibility to get a handle on before dating someone, straight up. It's fine to feel insecure, but managing those feelings is up to you. People don't like when others' insecurity is pushed into them, like if you say constantly ""I'm ugly,"" it's really annoying for another person to constantly assure ""no, you're not"" because they can't mamage your feelings, only you can, and repetition of insecurities just makes it seem like you're self absorbed and not listening to the advice of those around you. 
Looks are subjective. Pretty much just be healthy so you don't develop long term health issues throughout your life, but as long as you do that (for your own sake), someone will find you attractive eventually. You can speed up this process by socializing and meeting more people, thus increasing the probability of meeting someone compatible. 
If you truly needed sex, you could hire a sex worker. You need some self respect and respect for others as well. You have a lot of issues with women being turned off by a man wanting sex from them. Women are more than just givers of sex to men. Imagine if people came up to you constantly, ignoring your personhood completely, just in the hopes that they get something from you. The normal people response is ""fuck off."" 
A therapist might help you get a better perspective, but know that the world is not sex centric even if your thoughts are for now. If you want to see change, you'll have to work for it. Work on developing strong values and good habits that guide your actions. Work on seeing interpersonal relationships with women as more than just a route to sex. 
You have to see yourself as a person worth looking out for. Do your actions contribute to this negative way you feel?

">You have to dedicate your life to attracting women otherwise you’re a lazy entitled neck beard who deserves to be alone.

I mean this just isn't how the majority of people look at it. Like you have to try but this mindset isn't healthy. People have other needs that need to be met too. You need to balance all your needs.

> just don’t try and actually trying makes you desperate which is a turn off. Simply do nothing and women will flock to you!

This is also wrong. You don't have to try and put yourself out there, but a no is no. Walk away don't take it so seriously. Some people aren't going to vibe with you, some people just aren't in the mood right that second. Key to avoiding the try hard, looking desperate thing is knowing you'll be okay if you get a no, and then actually being okay with it.

>Be confident, like full narcissist you are a perfect person, and everyone is beneath you.

If you think everyone is beneath you, you're a pos. If you act like everyone is beneath you, you're a pos.  Confidence is knowing you have value and being okay with the fact that some things are not going to go your way. Knowing that when things don't go your way, you have the tools to survive and be okay.

>If you don’t think that then sorry sweetie but no one wants an insecure guy, YUCK!

Confidence is important. You're just framing what confidence is incorrectly.

> But also, you need to be hypercritical of all aspects of yourself and have no self-esteem otherwise you’re an entitled “nice guy.”

You can have self-esteem AKA understand that you have an inherent value because every human being does, and also understand that there are areas that you need to improve on. Yeah, I think people should work to improve themselves. It makes life more interesting. No, it doesn't take anything aware from your self-esteem. Working on yourself actually builds confidence and self-esteem. You gain skills, become good at things, fail, and encounter problems. 

>Looks don’t matter but have you tried doing everything in your power to be as attractive as possible?

Yeah, I was 260lbs. It wasn't until I lost the weight and thought I was hot shit that I realized how little anyone actually cared that I was fat. People were happy that I took some control over my health, but they didn't really care I was fit either. You should take care of yourself (groom, dress decently, etc.) because it shows people you have self-respect and that matters. Looks only matter a little.

>You’re not actually allowed to want sex, women will “smell that” (the phrase they always use) and hate you for it.

I'd argue this is wrong. They will, however, hate you for treating them like a sex object instead of a human being. You can be sexual attracted to that human being and make that desire clear. It's how most men pick girls up at bars.

>Make friends with them first! But not for the end goal of a relationship or at least sex because again they’ll smell that and hate you.

Don't have to be their friend first. I'd argue that this is more of a mental model to, again, get you to treat them like an actual human being. 

>Don’t be lonely, they’ll smell that and hate you.

Yeah, being lonely sucks. Make an effort to do interesting things, enjoy your own company, entertain yourself. Go out and talk to strangers. Take a class, join a club, volunteer. Get human interaction so that you enjoy your life. Again, people have a lot of needs. Romantic intimacy is not the principal one. 

>Just don’t need sex, defy all research and evidence of it being a human need in most people. Just don’t need it!

Dude, I've spent a lot of time masturbating. You can and should have a healthy sexual relationship with yourself. Do you need human connection, physical touch, and emotional intimacy? Yes, but you don't have to get those things through sex.

>It’ll happen eventually, your needs now don’t matter. Living in misery until 40 is fun right?

It sucks that you aren't feeling fulfilled. I read *Models* by Mark Manson, and that gave me a solid framework for how to think about these things. Life is hard. It takes a lot of courage to grow and put yourself out there, but it's like any other skill. You get better at it with time."

"> socialize with new people.

This is the best thing to counter depression. You don’t have to make friends but being around people helps give you perspective and insight into yourself that isolation makes hard. Seeing other people go about their lives makes you both strive for better but also helps you realize what strengths you yourself have.

You say you have hobbies - try doing hobbies with others (gym class, painting class) - and I stress this because lockdown may have taught us otherwise - try to do as many of them in-person.

Because everything doesn’t suck - it’s just hard to see that if all you have is yourself as a reference. I like to say depression is just a hyper focus on one’s own emotions - everyone else has struggles too it’s just hard to see that which is why getting out can help break those patterns over time.

P.S. just because you haven’t lived through a “real” tragedy does not mean you can’t have trauma. Pain is relative and if it’s something that is hurting you talk about it no matter how insignificant it may seem to you!

The only part of yourself you need to kill is the stupid mentality that has you believing you don't deserve to be a virgin despite not doing anything with your life.

You have so much to work on yourself. Get in the gym, make some money and actually do build your life. That's how a man becomes attractive.

"Been in your exact position at 19. Completely hopeless I’d ever be able to socialize normally. Suicidal. Your brain on depression lies to you. You can attain social skills. When you aren’t depressed you feel like you can do anything.

IMO, most of social “skills” is lack of anxiety. When you aren’t socially anxious, you can interact with people **genuinely**. When you are able to speak your mind with confidence is when people are most charming. My best advice for social skills is to mirror others. Watch how they interact and think about how what they’re doing works. A big thing that helped me was dr K videos where he interviews people. He also touches on social skills very often. It can be difficult to find information on this—our demographic is very underserved, but dr k is the best source I’ve seen on this.

The frequency of your suicidal ideation is worrying and is a pretty sure sign of depression. You’ve gotta focus on getting help for that the same way if you had a broken leg.

I (23M) have, over the course of the last 2-3 years, become decent friends with 3 female coworkers I’ll call C, A and E. I have had issues in my past where I am very quick to become borderline obsessive over female friends, even if the relationship is entirely platonic. I’m not sure why this happens but have attributed it to insecurity and low self esteem. This same thing happened with this group and that lasted for about a year. I don’t actually show that I’m having these feelings but the smallest things will make me feel hurt or left out, I only think about spending time with them or texting them, etc. 

In the past month I took a turn though, which also always has happened in past friendships. Eventually I wake up one day and don’t have these feelings anymore. They’re still my friends and I care about them as people and value our friendship but the obsessive is gone. This should be a good thing but I’m left with a feeling I can only describe as a sort of empty hole in my life. I would compare it to a time when I am super into a video game, looking forward to playing it when I’m at work or school but one day I lose these feelings and move on. It doesn’t necessarily depress me but I’m left with this feeling that I’m missing a piece of me. I almost miss the t feelings and find myself at times thinking the friendship is over.

Honestly it's very frustrating. And it's not just a stereotype even, depending on your community, it's also heavily reinforced socially. Dads are often seen as the providers, not nurtures. 

At least more public restrooms have diaper changing stations in the men's room instead of exclusively in the woman's.

"I'm at work listening to one of his lectures in the background and he is talking about the story of the Budda. He explains loosely that the Budda got curious and left his paradise of a home, pushing his limits, and he found something he couldn't handle so he quickly went home for comfort. He also talked about how young kids do this to their parents and the parents hugs were analgesic, relieving pain.

I've been struggling a lot recently but I've tried to just swallow it because my problems are damn trivial in comparison to a lot of people's problems. I never really understood why small things have such a huge effect on me. Listening to this got me thinking about what my ""home"" or ""hug"" was. What can I run back to for comfort to refresh my ability to push myself further?

"You can try, but keep in mind unless you’re physically  attractive you won’t be able to just have casual sex. Casual sex is based off of looks before anything else, personality and humor matter but only after you have gone passed the looks threshold. This threshold tends to be much higher than the boyfriend threshold, so you could get into a relationship with a woman and have sex through that. But I’m gonna advise against getting into a committed relationship off of sex.

As an average looking short man, I can tell you that casual sex is usually just not in the cards.

Women are human beings, not NPCs. Speak to them and get to know them. Will it be harder? Sure it might be. It’s even harder for people with dwarfism, yet they still end up married.

Height is the least interesting or important part of a person. Are you seeing a therapist? 


5’7 isn’t short.

I don’t find being “short” unattractive but I do find the following things to be a turn off: low self esteem. Constant self deprecating humor. Incessant obsession about height. 

When I broke up with a guy who was 5’7” it wasn’t because he was “short,”; it was because he seemingly never stopped talking about being short and how insecure he was about it and I just got tired of it and I couldn’t handle it anymore.


TLDR; hang in there. It’s not your height that’s getting in the way of your love life; for better or for worse.

"I’m gonna give you a little pushback, just know it’s coming from a very supportive and encouraging place. Hopefully you get some insight or ideas on how to move forward from the feedback!

You want an “athletic” woman (this is often code for “not fat”), but are upset that lots of women want a tall man? 

In my experience, men evaluate potential dates based on physical attributes WAY more than women. Women are much more likely to look past physical appearance and judge potential dates based on personality and internal qualities. Most dating apps don’t do a good job highlighting internal qualities as much as external.

Which are you more likely to see in the wild? A smoking hot “athletic” woman with a short, below average looking dude or a tall, smoking hot man with a fat, below average looking woman? I guarantee it’s the first one. 

I’d encourage you to try your best to let your personality shine through on the apps, or better yet, do some cool extracurriculars where women can actually get to know you beyond their initial impression based on your height. 

Maybe a pottery class, a book club, a group based on a hobby you like or an interest of yours? You could even join adult rec leagues in your community to find some “athletic” women (most areas I’ve lived have had leagues for sand volleyball, softball, pickleball, etc.) Women also love group exercise classes at the gym. If you’re into nerdy stuff, I think D&D groups can be a good way to meet new people as well. Volunteering is another great avenue since you’re often working directly with other volunteers on projects. 

I know it’s easy to feel crushed and hopeless in the face of rejection, maybe even bitter and resentful, and it’s absolutely okay to have that reaction. But, I promise if you start putting effort into investing in yourself and doing fun things with new people outside of dating, your life will feel fuller AND you’ll be more attractive and interesting as a potential mate! 

Focus on what you can do to be the best version of you and put yourself out there so that new people can meet you and get to know what makes you great. 

I say all this as a woman who has had 3 serious relationships in my life that lasted years (including my current relationship of 4 years) and they were all with men 5’6”-5’8”. And not that it should matter, but I was very conventionally attractive in my prime and was courted by many a tall man.

"Hey now. I’m a 5’1 female who’d be happy with a 5’7 man. I think we (I as a female am guilty of it to) have GOT to stop letting the online dating/app culture represent the entirety of what’s out there for us. Dating apps are inherently problematic because they only show the most superficial, controlled versions of us and naturally after using them, we expect a perfected idea of a person to pop up as we swipe. I bet half those women, if they met you irl wouldn’t reject you so quick. 5’7 is average height for men after all, and dating apps are meant to make the choice easy. In person dating is not the same. Keep your head up, don’t let the false images and representations of real life represent reality. 

I think television and super outgoing people make it look easy to find someone, but the truth is, it’s hard for everyone. 

I know I’m not male and this is a place to discuss male mental health, but I just thought I’d share an alternate perspective as a female.

Edit: I guess I also want to add, do NOT treat apps as your only route to Honeymoon Avenue.

Also you can cut the bs with ""I want the athletic girls"" its okay to say you dont want to sleep with someone who is fat. Funny how youre acting all polite towards female body acceptance in a post all about you being discriminated for your body.

"Don't kill yourself. You clearly work hard on yourself. The world is a better place for having you in it, even if it seems others are not willing to acknowledge that.

I'm 29, 5'4"". I've dated a bit, but I won't invalidate you like a lot of people will. Everyone is insecure about something, they rarely put those insecurities in their own head. And I guarantee that for every person saying, ""just don't be insecure,"" there has been another who has explicitly put him down over it and ten more ""well-intentioned"" people who have made comments that are worse than anything a bully could ever come up with.

The fact is that your height makes other people perceive you as less masculine. Is being ""masculine"" good? No, not necessarily. Sure, a lot to be said for confidence and being ""take charge,"" but not when that is coupled with anti-intellectualism and hyper-individuality, as it often is in the West. But good or bad, it is a social script that we are expected to follow and so failing to do so will make us appear ""socially inferior"". For us, we can take solace in the fact that others' perception of us is largely superficial and their read on us as perhaps ""lesser"" or ""weak"" isn't really based on anything real. So while masculinity is not necessarily ""good"" or ""bad"" it is ""attractive"".

Short men have to compensate for their perceived lack of masculinity some way. I know a lot of short men who are very popular with women, many of them are quite unattractive. And with one exception, every other one of them is a giant, performative, alpha male douchebag with a Napoleon Complex with a criminal record. Because that's masculine. You aren't playing those performative, toxic games. You aren't stomping around demanding attention. You aren't violating other people and talking tough and starting trouble to prove what a big man you are.

If you're short and can't get a date, it probably says something more positive about your character than most people's ""Just World Fallacy"" will allow them to admit. It sucks to have people perceive you as lesser, but pay attention to what people approve of. Sometimes scorn can be a crown."	imloatinthesad	reply	na	na	na	0.9845468401908875	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"I do feel the same way. And yes, height is so integral to your looks that not having enough inches will make or break you. I changed my height on dating apps once as a test, swiped for a week with 6 foot and then my real height at 5’6 and basically the same thing happened to me. I never put my height on apps ever again after that. I’m also average looking, so add that and I basically want to kill myself when I look in the mirror. 

Still, you can find relationships. Most guys can find one, even short guys. Take it from a guy who can find relationships relatively easily, but causal sex has never even been an option for me. There has never been a time where I had more than one woman interested in me at one time, and while in a relationship I never had options to cheat or anything outside of it. Relationships are built on much more than looks which is why most men can find one. I’ve had multiple through my life, as a teenager and then in my 20s.

"Like seriously, what fucking benefit is there to being like this? It’s taken all the issues I already have had and currently had and intensified it by 100. 

Being autistic, among other things, already cuts me off from ever forming a friendship/relationship with the overwhelming majority of the population.
The vast majority of people in the world, even other neurodivergent people, view autistic men as undesirable weirdos. They all think that we are like Chris Chan and just an immature loser who can’t do even the most basic things on his own like everyone else and needs a mommy to care for him 24/7. I quote ""autistic men just want a mommy,  not an actual partner"". When people know, they all always talk down to you like you are a child, and will actively avoid talking to you because they want nothing to do with you. Which to be fair, if you're able to get a better deal why would you settle for less? Any woman can get a neurotypical guy who knows how to actually be normal and has since he was 13. No reason to settle for an autist, even if he's wealthy, interesting or talented. The average person wants absolutely nothing to do with an autistic man, to them they’re just a weirdo that they can point and laugh at with their friends and partners over how much of a loser they are. No girl with even the smallest amount of standards or self respect would ever waste her time or energy going on a date with an autist when there are inherently better and more appealing guys just within arms reach. I seriously cannot stress enough how much the average person hates autistic men and how they would never love them. Dating a girl as an autistic man, especially if they are neurotypical, is basically like wrestling with a grizzly bear; insurmountable odds which will only ever leave you hurt and bleeding.

To best see how much of a burden being autistic is, you only need to learn about masking. You are taught from the time you are able to stand on two feet and read that the behaviors and mannerisms associated with autism and autism in and of itself are completely unattractive, annoying and repulsive to most people. If you want ANY sort of chance of having even the smallest amount of social success, you must mask it. You must spend the entirety of your life learning to play pretend, feigning to have the social skills and awareness of normal people and putting up the persona of being a normal and attractive person with normal hobbies and preferences which you must put in continuous exhausting effort to maintain everyday only ever taking it off when you are home. The problem is that that mask you have on isn’t really you, it’s a facade, a character you are playing constantly to present yourself as desirable to others. Who you REALLY are and how you REALLY act and think is something actively repulsive to others, so you have to suck up your pride and stop being authentic to yourself and just wear the mask of conformity. The moment that masks slips, the moment you say or do something which can be viewed as the mannerisms and reactions of a autistic person, you will be labeled as the weirdo and promptly avoided and viewed as a loser, and thus left to rot alone.

I’ve been starting to go to a center for autistic people a few times in order to meet up with people and plan out an outing. It is VERY easy to tell that most of the, especially younger, volunteers who work there either don’t think about the autistic guys there or actively look down on them and treat them like they’re a nuisance. They talk to them like they’re an overgrown child, someone who gets on their nerves all the time and makes them wish they’d just buckled down and applied to a daycare. They’ll put on the veil of a caretaker who’s empathetic and kind to their associates, but you can bet your ass and legs that they go home every night complaining to their partners how annoying and frustrating they were and how they wish they could just quit.

I hate being autistic. I hate it so so much. Everyone hates me for it and I’ll never truly be able to connect with or form a bond with normal people or find a relationship. Even when I go to the group outings at the center to get to know them, I’m scared. I’m scared that we’ll be in public and everyone around us will be actively looking at us and judging us. They’ll see us as the weirdos, the fucking massive losers who no one would ever date or love. No girl is ever going to love me nor can I truly ever be myself without people hating me. I don’t want this disease, I want to be normal like everyone else so that I can have even the smallest chance of being accepted and loved. I need a cure, I need to be normal to be loved."

"I obviously don’t know your entire situation, but heres my 2 cents as a level 2 “autist”

If you wallow in self pity you’ll never end up going anywhere. Yes we’ve been dealt a shit hand, yes it sometimes feels so alienating and theres no way of going back but if you keep complaining about problems with no action nothings going to change for you.

You’re complaining about masking, then don’t. If people don’t want to hang around you then good, fuck them. Why would you want to be around people who can’t handle a little bit of weirdness? If you want to genuinely improve your mental health, as cliche as this sounds you gotta be yourself. And thats not just “aw treat yourself to a nice drink/dinner” or “just find a show that you enjoy”, thats being proud of who you are, being able to accept when youre wrong and change your mind on topics.

Its not your fault that any of this happened to you but it is your fault letting yourself stay at the bottom.


For example:
I fucking love kayaking and camping, I love playing video games, I love my family. I masked for my job and that was about it, I worked hard to have fun with the people I enjoy being around and learned to let those who didn’t enjoy being around me go. I filtered myself and built myself a happy life over years and years because I wanted to, not my parents, not the doctors/therapists."

"I'll let you in on a little secret bro, from one autistic guy to another; nobody cares that you're autistic.

Nobody on the street gives enough of a shit about you to even notice, let alone take time away from thinking about themselves long enough to have an opinion about a stranger.

If someone is working at an autism center, it's not because they're trapped there against their will, forced to work with a gun to their head. You're the better alternative. You can wipe your own ass. You can hold an actual conversation. Yes you need extra help and they're in some ways taking advantage of that. They get paid to help you do things that are easy for them. But that's ok. That's how most jobs work.

The only thing stopping you from being loved, is the fact you've already decided everyone hates you and the normies can sense that. It puts them off. The thing we lack, that secret language that everyone else seems to speak? That's the non verbal shit you're still putting out in every interaction whether you realize it or not. People can tell your hating, but it often comes off like you're hating on them and not yourself. 

Find something you like. Your probably have something you like quite a bit. Find people who also like that thing and just focus on that. People spend their whole childhood building relationships and we didn't. We couldn't. You're behind, but you can fix it. You can use critical thinking to move past your limits and learn how to make friends and relationships. It will take time and patience and you will have to work at it. Don't expect you'll just immediately click with someone. But if your not an asshole, be patient, kind and work with people, they will eventually get used to you. It may take years but your only other choice is to keep living isolated and alone. 

I was very alone for the first 20 years of my life, 10 years of work later I have multiple people who would take a bullet for me. Do I always think I deserve it? No. Do I always fully understand what I did to get to this point? Not at all. But it seems it was just trying without expectations."

If a person understands and doesn’t have a low IQ (below 70) then why talk to that person like if they are 3 years old.

"As an autistic person.....yes there are days I hate the challenges that being autistic creates as it makes things like socializing and being outside my comfort zones very anxiety producing. 

But I don't hate being autistic. Sure I have to deal with a lot of things neurotypical folks don't and take for granted, but it's not a bad thing. Cooping skills can be learned. Once I started to figure out how to hack my own brain a bit things got easier. I also see a therapist regularly to help with my stress level and help me problem solve since I'm not the best at liner thinking. I've also been on anti anxiety meds for years and they help a lot. 

And one of the things I've learned is I don't socialize like the average person, but I found ways that work for me. Honestly writing helped a lot with that. Texts, message boards, places like this. Writing doesn't have all those confusing cues of tone, expression and body language. I can focus my energy on the important part, the conversation. Over time I got better at expressing myself through writing and I mean years. But turns out all that writing helped me figure out how to communicate better in general and I'd catch myself talking like I wrote...which is more clear and structured than my weird anxious ramblings are. 

I ramble less, I stay on topic more, it's easier to not hyper fixate and accidentally derail a conversation in person and less likely to over share  So I'm less likely to seem rude when talking to folks in general. It's made it easier to be social in person since the weird little gremlin in my brain has learned a little patience.  

Better communication skills has honestly done wonders at improving the quality of my life, my friendships, and my romantic relationships. 

Because at the end of the day, if you have poor communication skills, you'll find things lacking whether you are autistic or not and being autistic isn't an excuse for poor communication skills. It just takes us a few extra steps to figure out and taking the time to figure out how we communicate best.  

Work with the anxiety and the communication issues and a lot of other stuff becomes phenomenally easier. Learn to work with your autism, however it presents, rather than against it and you'll find you're hitting your head against a brick wall and expecting the wall to move a lot less."

"ADHD is very common so I have to say that’s not a good excuse. I also doubt any clinician has made that claim to you. If you’re 19 and making such concrete statements about your life i honestly have to roll my eyes a little bit. Simply because you are not even a fully developed adult, not even gotten the chance to get out and experience life yet, and you have roughly 60-70 years left on earth to get your shit together. 

Think about it, you have spent nearly your whole life in a school environment and depending on your situation, you might still be in that environment. Nobody is expecting you to have it all figured out and be a perfect person except yourself and that’s simply because you don’t know better. 

Even in 2-3 years you won’t be anything like you are now. You won’t be in the same situation with your friends, your family, your job, or even where you’re at mentally. 

It makes no sense to call it quits when you’re literally still a teenager, man. Whatever you’re feeling right now sucks, don’t get me wrong, it feels miserable. But it isn’t permanent in the slightest. Just keep going to therapy and working on yourself. Good things will come, don’t force it. You’re not on a schedule. 

Don’t make permanent decisions on temporary emotions. 

Everyone feels like they just annoy people from time to time when really you probably just haven’t found your people yet. Especially if you’re trying to fit in with people you met in highschool. I mean we are out in a tiny box with people our age for 8 hours a day every day and forced to get along with a few of those 30 odd individuals who you might not actually have anything in common with. Give it a few years, you’ll probably realize that the people you chose to spend time with had little to nothing in common with you and you only hung out to avoid being alone. You’ll find better people who won’t make you feel like you’re annoying them and will actually lift you up. 

If I gave up at 19 I would have missed out on a whole lot of life experiences that I wouldn’t ever choose to give up today. Every single day is a new day with new opportunities, new choices to make, new experiences to have, and new people to meet. It isn’t really a matter of changing yourself (unless you have some seriously damaging behaviors), it’s more a matter of utilizing your time and personality to your advantage. 

Have a hobby? Go meet people with that hobby. Like a sport? Join a team. Need to learn better social skills? There are so many groups out there, group therapy even, that is intended just for that.

"As an exercise, sit down and list how and where you definitely know you've annoyed the shit out of someone. Now, think of equivalent instances when people have annoyed the fuck out of you to a similar degree and manner. If those fuckers haven't topped themselves from cringe, why are you being this extra? You copped some issues in the tutorial and opening arc, and you want to Alt+F4 and uninstall already?

Trying and failing can feel like absolute shit and you may engage in suicidal ideation as pain relief. If you're entirely honest to yourself, it's really not harder than successfully killing yourself, is it? Killing yourself is terrifying. It's hard fucking work.

If you can decide to kill yourself, you can talk yourself into continually doing one little thing for your growth that's a lot less terrifying and a lot less work than killing yourself. Said one little thing may run the gamut from slightly uncomfortable to absolutely mortifying. I would personally advise not going too far into the assclenching part of the part of the spectrum just yet. You don't have the emotional regulation to benefit as you are, that will come with time and persistence.

Let's be fucking real here, most 19 year olds are annoying, and they rarely have anything of value to say that isn't badly paraphrased from someone else's work. You aren't alone, you aren't special, and that's great because there's a metric fuckton of resources out there to help you.

I wish people understood that we can suffer too."	asexual_amanita	post	17.3783685539616	female	White	0.00929618626832962	na	na	na	7	malementalhealth
"I hear you, Kai.  There are many areas in life where men are at a disadvantage.  Support is one of them.  It can be extremely difficult for a man to be supported in his personal work.  It can be hard to feel that you are allowed to voice your struggles. The overall effect of this is that we tend to ignore our emotions and feelings.  We stuff them down so they don't show to others.  That is not healthy for us.  That is not what we need.

I have found that a good men's group has been super helpful in having a regular space where I don't have to ""man up"" and I am allowed to be ""not ok"".  I know I can be vulnerable there and I am safe from unreasonable judgements.  Finding such a place has helped me expand my vulnerability in my regular life and to handle the push-back when it shows up.  It has helped me advocate for myself and to know, both mentally and internally, that my feelings and thoughts are valid; that I do not need someone else to give me the permission to feel that way.

Best of luck to you, Kai."	asexual_amanita	reply	na	na	na	0.00929618626832962	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"Agreed, I’ve struggled with anxiety, ADD and chronic depression for a long time and it feels like I’m never taken seriously because of it, at worst it’s treated like a freak occurrence or problem, because men are rational, logical and solve problems, so why aren’t I just solving the problem etc? I just want my feelings to he heard and acknowledged like a human being 

It’s also frustrating when we’re told to “man up” by men, but women also enforce it in their own ways, usually seeing a man who’s more emotional as weak, effeminate, not masculine and then told to stop whining and throwing ourselves pity party. It upsets me a ton when no one seems to really understand you and make assumptions because of your gender

"Hey Kai

I'm a men's transformation coach and strongly believe men do need to man up. 

Here's the problem:

Many, if not most men are disenfranchised and do not have the facilities and understanding how to make these changes.

At your age, I had severe mental issues. This stemmed all the way until my mid 20s, with some traumas replaying constantly 'til my later 20s. 

When I say I had severe mental issues, I mean self-harming in front of a former love; multiple suicide attempts after surviving a near-death experience; excruciating anxiety & depression; DPDR, etc. 

One of the last things I heard before my first suicide attempt was an old eastern European man telling me to man up while having a breakdown in public after being attacked while drunk. 

The biggest irony: had I had the resources to understand and guide me towards masculinity in the first place, my life wouldn't had ended up where it did. 

For me journey to where I am today was a large process of ""undoing"". Undoing societal ideas of how we should be; undoing the negative self-beliefs bullying instilled in my mind; undoing the traumatic nightmares that haunted the depths of my psyche.

Learning what had to be undone took years to which I've spent the past half-decade leaving no stones unturned (cleansing everything). 

If there's one major understanding I want to share with as many men as I can, it's that the process of ""manning up"" isn't independent from this process of letting go. 

Letting go IS the path to manning up. It will be the hardest thing you ever do, and in overcoming that level of brutality do you not only enter manhood, but discover why you are here to begin with."	asexual_amanita	reply	na	na	na	0.00929618626832962	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"What a great question. The truth is men do suffer but no one wants to follow a leader who does. Let me explain. 

I am almost 46, I have an issue with anger because it's a lifelong lesson that I did learn. I am a taking a class at my church that is helping me with this issue. It's a program designed to heal your heart of the traumas in your life. It's a wonderful program to be able to let out how I feel but it does bring up unresolved issues. Thats the part that people can't really understand. 

Let me explain what I mean. There are stages in the healing process just like a cut on your body. If the cut is deep, then it heals from the inside out. We clean the wound and keep it covered so infection doesn't happen. Some cuts heal quickly like a minor cut, but a deep wound takes time and consistent treatment to be healed. This is the part that people don't want to have to deal with. The wound that keeps causing the issues. All you can do with this is, be patient with your healing and with those who don't know how to address it but also stay the course to your restoration."	asexual_amanita	reply	na	na	na	0.00929618626832962	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"
I almost rarely ever share about this because I’ve built emotional resilience around it and I don’t feel people understand. This week is my first time ever posting about my voice.

I have damaged vocal chords from invasive surgery (tracheotomy because of an underdeveloped airway) as a young child and the result is my voice is quieter and raspy and isn’t super audible in a fair amount of situations, meaning I can’t talk loudly enough in a variety of situations. I can speak but it’s a fluid handicap meaning that it’s worse sometimes and easier for me at other times and it kind of is unpredictable in that way, in that I don’t know how I will be treated. I know this sounds like not that big of a grievance and I know plenty of people have it worse but I just wanted to open a conversation on disability in general for men and share my experience. 

It has led to me feeling less than compared to other kids growing up, not being able to assert myself around other guys, being bullied, being not included, and feeling undesired romantically because of it (I’ve had instances where girls have had to speak up for me on dates and it’s embarrassing). I have had shame around my voice growing up and as much as I acknowledge it isn’t anything severe, instances of frustration add up, being left out of conversations or treated coldly etc. 
There are times where I don’t think about having this handicap and then times where I really can’t have that privilege. 

The reason I bring it up is not really for me but because I don’t feel like people, and men with disabilities especially, are recognized to the extent they perhaps should be in a lot of discussions in social justice. I know we have male privilege and in my case I come from a fairly affluent family but I feel like disability is still valid to have a conversation about, considering people with all kinds of disabilities are discriminated against.

My voice, coupled with my height, has made me feel like I could never be that traditional bold, aggressive frat bro type at the top of the social ladder that is held up as an ideal for men to aspire to and who is thought of as ultra-desirable. I have never been able to be that person. At the same time I have felt I am considered too privileged to be disadvantaged in any real way that matters in social justice culture even though I can give numerous examples throughout my life.

While I am a huge supporter of social justice and the work many are doing, I suppose I feel a bit disillusioned by some in social justice spaces since I feel like due to my voice- I, in a lot of ways growing up, haven’t been able to fulfill classic competitive standards of being a man but can’t find my concerns in any talk of intersectionality in the culture. 

In recent years as intersectionality is talked about more and more, I have come to feel like a privileged man who has always, at some level, been denied full access or capacity to express or embody that privilege."

Thanks for bringing this up as I could not agree more. Men with disabilities whether they be physical, mental, or both are not taken seriously as at a baseline level men themselves are not taken seriously until they prove by merit they exceptionally stand out from the rest. Which probably goes without mentioning in this particular sub. Factoring in what is commonly perceived to be the ideal embodiment of the modern man, with some of the reasons you mentioned, is exactly why you should not feel as though your condition is disingenuous or worth any less just because other people may have it worse. Especially if you have the social experiences and interactions to back it up. It will be ironic to state this after having said all the aforementioned, but this is also why one should opt to avoid comparing themselves to others in a negative manner.

"As a disabled man as well....albilism is a huge problem. My limitations make it so i have no choice but to adapt to my condition and miss out on things I once found a meaningful part of my life because I am simply unable to do them or push myself past the limits of my tolerance. 

Most folks don't even realize they are biased, having been surrounded by able bodies folks all their lives and never having to stop to consider making things more inclusive or accessible. They take good, ""normal"" health for grated because it's all they've ever known and it shows. 

Sure intersectionality helps, but so does representation, it not like folks with atypical health are on everyone's current binge worthy show outside of medical dramas like House. Hell I loved the fact that he had chronic pain and a disability, other than being an insufferable asshole. 

But at least I saw something of myself represented somewhere, chronic pain and a cane is my life though for very different reasons.

"What you're feeling is valid and true

I feel like I have to say this so somebody reading this doesn't think this is just a white guy echochamber. I'm a very very neurodivergent black man. My current medical diagnosis is bipolar but I suspect it's autism as I was masking heavily during the psychological evaluation. 

The people you are seeking moral acceptance from are just like you, in the sense that they are human. Humans usually don't empathize with others unless they feel some induced pressure to do so. You may see these people are moral superiors, but a good bit of them are just acting in their best interests and don't really have any increased capacity for empathy relative to the normal human. 

What I'm saying is most of those people aren't ever really going to like you or accept your plight, because they're not ""good"" people, it's more akin to pretending to be a good person. 

I have four rules of life. My third rule is I don't empathize with any individual in any circumstance who refuses to empathize with me specifically. Group entities are ignored. It has made me much happier so I suggest you take it up.

But she is very brutal and very mentally abusive. If I am in pain or mentally not doing well. She will say I am over exaggerating, lying, or looking for Sympathy. She also suffers from Depression, but refuses to seek help herself, I once told her to see a therapist and she told me straight out she is fiine and she isn;t crazy like me, with an attitude and raised voice.   


There are multiple other stories that shows signs of mental abuse but I do not know what to do.

I don;t want to live anymore like this, I constantly think about suicide as she makes me feel worthless and not even human, I live in Australia but I do not know anyone that can help me.

"Hi there.  That sounds like a lot for you to deal with by yourself.  It sounds like too much for you to manage and I hope you can find some support somewhere.  You're facing obstacles on so many fronts and it's no surprise you're feeling overwhelmed.

* Your own, personal issues that you mention
* Dealing with an aging parent and their physical condition
* Dealing with an abusive parent
* Facing these struggles with no other support

"My close friend has been very open to me, she always tells me about her struggles and negative emotions. She has a really bad and abusive household and she's still struggling with depression and self-harm, mentioning that she wants to end it all and just kill herself. And that whenever a problem ‏occurs she would go to the roof and really think about jumping and ending it all. Things have been bad lately, I know that she might do it since she now can't even stand the mention of “future” She didn't say why but I understood that she doesn't see herself being there. We usually open a meeting in google meet whenever we wanna talk, we'd chat like we usually do, say some silly stuff here and there, and laugh about it, and of course, her updating me about her family situation and her feelings in general. We always stay on call for hours talking. 

Two days ago, she was really mad at me because I didn't show up to school and that very few students came to school in general, told her that I already told her a day before that none of us would attend, and she said she didn't see it but was still furious either way. Hours passed and she decided to talk to me on a call like always, she was still mad and said if she wasn't in need to talk about her family problem asking me what to do she wouldn't talk to me because she was still mad at me and that both her mothers insisted that she talk with me(her father have two wives). For context, my mother is a lawyer and so both her mothers reach out to me and my mother asking for help, both her mothers are foreigners and I obviously don’t understand their language so they tell her what to say and she’d translate it for me. They weren’t with us on the call but they had previously spoken to her, as she was still mad she also said that she was also mad at her own mother because she was about to cancel her plans for a divorce suit, I asked for more information and she went all the way explaining the matter. 

What I hated the most is that whenever her family proceed to move forward in solving their problems something would happen that would discourage them to advance any further, even if my mother told them otherwise they'd still feel discouraged and scared the moment they hear something else from a close one, leaving actual advice coming from a lawyer just because someone close who didn't even study law told them otherwise.

[I can't go into full detail about her whole family problems.]

I always keep reminding her that I'm always here for her to listen. She always thanks me for listening, last Friday she reached out to me saying if it was ok to talk, I said of course and so we opened a meeting, she said that she was scared that her father would beat her up bc he saw her being mad hitting her bother with a stick, and she kept crying saying how she's just like her father because whenever he gets angry he beats them up and that she knows that because of her personality, everyone would leave her just like her mothers told her, I told her that I would never leave and I'd always stay with her, she cried even more saying “If only people were like you, the world would've been better” It hit me hard because even though she trusts me and know I would be the one to listen to her I still haven't helped her much. 


Her family is the root of the problem and it shows that it affects her badly, if it were to end it'll surely help her a lot with her mental health. whenever I ask about what can I do to help her, everyone tells me that I can't do anything about that matter, I surely can't just stay still doing nothing while I wait for her to take her own life, I wanna talk to both her mothers so I can give them a piece of my mind hopefully serving its goal as a wake-up call to take action.

I aapluad you for wanting to help your friend our and for being there for her during such a difficult time. I think the best thing to do would be to encourage her to talk to a school counselor or talk to a therapist. Either one would be able to intervene and help her out.

The situation at home is not going to get better on its own and if something is not done I believe the likelihood of suicide increases. These are very difficult situations.

You should scroll through this subreddit and see how many posts there are. Do the same for places like r/teenagers, r/relationships, and so many other subreddits. Literally NO ONE is normal. All of us are struggling, to different degrees and in different parts of life. Social media does a number on people because we deliberately only post the best parts of our lives there, and the rest of us then get convinced that it's only us struggling with the issues we are struggling with.

So don't believe the hype. Know that you aren't alone. Talk to people IRL about this too. Find good friends. Let yourself use social media a bit less.

I might also say, practice a bit of a mindset change. Every night before you go to bed, force yourself to write out one good thing about your day and one thing you are thankful for. Of course this won't fix your problems. But I know that it did a lot more for me than I was expecting it to.

Also, recognize that you're in an emotional state. Emotions don't last.

I considered myself unattractive at 18 and if I look back at my pictures now, I am like ""Damn! I was good-looking!""

Girls in their teens can be quite prudish. They are not completely comfortable with their bodies and they do not want to be slut-shamed. It's understandable given the current hurn to conservatism. My advice would be to approach older women. I am not saying woman in their 40s, 50s or 60s (although I am sure some of those cougars would love to devour an 18-year old dick). Women in their 20s and 30s have had more experience. They aren't afraid of being slut-shamed because they are no longer in a toxic high school environment. They will think that your cockyness mixed with naivety is cute. My second sexual experience was with an older person and it was immensely informative. Treat it like an educational experience. She knows what she wants and she will tell you how to do it. Just be humble, respectful and admit that you are still learning. She will turn you into her sex toy and you will benefit from it. That said, do not get too attached because she won't expect more than sex from you (necessarily).

Secondly, just get on with your life. My experience is that when you go out looking for sex, it won't happen. When a guy knows himself, follows his interests and become really good at his job, then that passion translates to confidence. People (women and men) love confident and passionate people. A guy that is passionate and interesting (and interested)is much sexier than a guy stalking girls because he wants to get it on. If you focus on becoming your best possible self, you will find that sex will come to you. You will go hiking with a friend and she will put her hand on your crotch, or you will host a games evening and that one girl will linger behind etc. Be open to spontaneity and ALWAYS respect consent."

"Look....women can smell desperate, lonely and insecure from a mile away. 

They just aren't interested in insecure men seeking sex for validation. Those guys just aren't boyfriend material, which the majority are looking for at that age. Those kind of guys are emotionally high maintenance, mentally draining, and are pretty much guaranteed to have unhealthy attachment styles, be extremely jealous and possessive, and have serious entitlement problems. ....and are frequently in denial about just how problematic their attitude is and that it drives away potential interest. 

I can't accurately judge you as a person via a rant and call for advice on the net...but they way you talk about the sex issue ... Major incel vibes. ... Chicks sense that shit and it's actually incredibly dangerous to them as the kinds of attitudes and beliefs incels have towards women and sex has lead to an extremely large portion, of instances of violence, expecially sexual violence against women. 

So dude....you are giving off so many red flags to women that you've reached potential threat level.  Women are super cautious about that and for very good reason.  No women wants to put their self in the path of toxic and abusive relationships to say nothing of the other types of terror. 

Maybe try to be the kind of guy women feel safe to be vulnerable around. Cause sex is a very vulnerable thing for women, make no mistake.

And Maybe go back to your therapist and work on further dismantling your unhealthy views of yourself as only being worth what others sexually value as proven by getting sex. 

And as a guy nearing 40, if you think guys put in zero effort to get bunches of regular sex ....you are very very mistaken."	AskingQwstionh	reply	na	na	na	0.9991759657859802	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

If you are watching porn to the point you only see women as sexual objects, that’s a problem. 

But if you are occasionally having a wank to relieve sexual tension or stress, that’s fine and completely normal. In fact it’s essential for prostate health to ejaculate regularly.

"These are more thoughts concerning outside of the internet. I am 28M living in England.  


So I drafted a quick plan:

don't rely on people; don't seek validation from others; don't be dependent on others; don't seek emotional support from others; don't seek help from others; don't heavily invest in others; don't share your problems with others; and relationships seem to be one sided for me.   


As such, I do not see the point of relationships at all, for me anyways. If I essentially have to be this hyper independent, hyper efficient and so on, kind of man, doesn't that make relationships a joke? Also, I am average looking so I don't get ""choosing signals"" from women. I could try to approach them and ask them out say, but I have seen how women react to a man they are attracted to versus me...doesn't take a genius to work that one out. And, idk why it rubs me the wrong way but I try to help others, I try to be with others and so on but it hardly swings the other way. At least I have people that can vouch for me on a professional level but never beyond that.  


Lol don't get me started with the whole ""hobbies"" thing either. I tried it and felt so alone and ironically more isolated than if I am alone. Not sure what that is but it's how it feels. It's ironic though that people say do hobbies to meet people but when I do hobbies it seems that there really isn't a chance to actually do meaningful things with people unless you are part of their in-group. It's like that thing of if children find that one child is ""weird"" they will be excluded from everything and then this fucks them up for life

I don't want to be looked as a pathethic manchild victim of a man but it's not exactly fun or thrilling to try and try and try and try with the same or similar results only to be told ""You need to manage your emotions"" only. Idk sometimes I feel I am becoming worse. As in, I feel that I rely on manipulative tactics and so on just to get what I want. I don't like it but it seems that people enjoy being sold on something. A person won't buy a product unless you tell them a convincing and gripping story it seems

"This weekend, I thought I'd invite some people from my dance group to a cherry blossom festival. Beforehand, someone suggested going to brunch. Several people went to brunch there. During that, I felt like I was being talked around, not really included in the conversation, and none of my contributions being really noticed. Then after brunch, everyone started being ambivalent about going to the festival, because the forecast mentioned rain later, so we ended up not going. And then it didn't rain. A few hours later, I went to a house party. The interactions were basically the same.

I have literally no one I can talk to about the fact that I feel like I'm not really connected with anyone in a more than superficial way, and that I can't have any conversation deeper than some pleasantries, and that it makes me feel terrible. If I tell anyone I know about it? Well, it will feel personal to them ""Wait, you don't consider me a friend?"" If I talk to it with my mom?

I lost two of my childhood pets in quick succession, my mother started proceedings to divorce my step-dad (and I was the only person that knew for ~2-3 months, so I was caught in the middle), I started a new job which I thought would be a monumental career change for me but instead turned into months of guilt and shame after I was constantly treated differently because of my chronic illness/disability. Needless to say I wasn't doing so well.


At the same time, my ex was struggling to hold her job down and was also falling out with a lot of friends that we shared (that I introduced her to). She tried to get me to cut ties with them after her and they stopped talking, and once again I was caught in the middle. I chose not to, and the weeks that followed were hell. I was constantly hearing how these people were actually horrible and manipulative, and how they don't care about me etc. All the time I was also trying to support her to hold her job down and it just become too much.


I had a minor breakdown where I cried and eventually opened up how I can't handle all the stressors at once. In my explanation, I said that I wish I could just blip out of existence for a while and not have to worry about life and other people. I got told I was selfish for thinking that way and it cut deep. I have an extremely hard time opening up to people, both due to my upbringing and also the stigma around displaying vulnerability as a man. Me breaking down and confiding in the one person I thought could support me back after years of giving it the other way, completely backfired. 


We're broken up now, and I feel more alone than ever. I have all these thoughts and feelings I wish I could express to people but can't. I know it isn't selfish and I know I was emotionally abused, but the association that's been made between opening up and feeling selfish is hard to sever. I haven't spoken to my friends or family about this because I fear it'll provoke a similar reaction.

I don't know where I'm going with this or what I'm expecting, but all I know is that I hate the reality of opening up as a male. It's led me into this cycle of isolation where I pull away from others, which then makes me feel worse, which then makes me pull away even more.


Tldr: it's hard for me to open up to people, and the one time I needed it the most I was told I was selfish. The words have scarred me deep even though I know they aren't necessarily true."	chucky2000	post	15.525240145040193	female	White	0.9988479614257812	na	na	na	6	malementalhealth

"Hey, just want to put out there that I see that you’re really struggling, and I think anyone in that position would have had a similar reaction. I’m sorry your girlfriend was actually the one being selfish and saying those hurtful things to you. I don’t think she realized that what you said is actually quite serious and could be a sign of passive suicidal ideation. Please make sure to take care of yourself during these times because it can really take a toll. I’ll also advise to try and not take what she said personally and don’t internalize it. It’s hard, but know that what you said wasn’t selfish at all. 

Recognize that what she said is actually more reflective of herself than of who you are. It’s hard to find, but there are women that recognize their partner is a machine but a human. A partner is not someone who can compensate for some aspect of who they are, but just that — a partner in life. 

Consider finding support groups — friends, family, even maybe a therapist. We all need social support, we’re social animals after all. Despite your hardships, try not to harden. We harden because we don’t want to be hurt again — I’m the first to tell you that I understand this. But I’ve gone through a lot to let you know that you are much more resilient than you think and that, while this is hard, your existence is proof of your strength. Despite, despite, despite, be gentle. You can overcome any hardship that comes your way, but you will not live truly if you deprave yourself from a basic human need — intimacy and love."	chucky2000	reply	na	na	na	0.9988479614257812	strong	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"Hey guys, I'm a 27 year old male and single. I just wanted to know you guys point of view of chasing and grinding to pursue your dreams and goals while being in a relationship or dating.

I am very serious and currently working on chasing my dreams, but I am also aware that I am kind of getting old and wanted to try dating and being in a romantic relationship. I have a very strict schedule (such as 3 to 4 hours of focus work a day before my fulltime work and 2 sessions of focus work on weekends) and one thing that I have a big problem with is giving or compromising up my time to date or be in a relationship. This is especially hard now because there are beautiful women in my vicinity who I feel like just waiting for me to ask them out lol. Although I am willing to give up some of  my time for the right woman, I feel this unsettling feeling of guilt every time I think of spending my time with other things (which in this case dating)  because maybe I feel like I am decreasing my chances of reaching my dreams.

I was wondering what are your experiences of being in a relationship or dating while chasing your dreams? does it make it better or worse? pros and cons? any  advice will be appreciated."	South_Attitude8695	post	31.497625980154346	male	White	0.006369859911501408	na	na	na	4	malementalhealth
"Completely disagree with every other comment in this thread so far. My wife is one of the biggest motivations and inspirations in my life and that is *not* because she is highly career motivated.

We are social beings and relationships are *important.* The stereotypes around being the ""lone wolf"" who doesn't need another human presence and just grinds 100% of the time is  false. It is a great feeling to have someone in your life who you are truly willing to put before yourself, *even* if that means having to work harder or get creative about how you make time for your career.

Even beyond the obvious fact that it feels good to be in a loving relationship I'd consider that there are actually important things a relationship teaches you that your career does *not*. Things about being a more patient, committed, and selfless person.

I am still highly career motivated. I work as a leader in a fast-paced technology startup, spend tons of time at work, and make room for studying and other ""self improvement"" habits on the side."	South_Attitude8695	reply	na	na	na	0.006369859911501408	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"Only start dating if you are ready to stop persuing your dreams. 

A girlfriend will always be verbally supportive of your dreams, but the moment those dreams interfere with the time she spends with you, those dreams are now another woman. She'll talk about them condescendingly, making you sound like a man-child who won't get his head out of the clouds. Her friends will automatically agree with her.

Women, as much as I want to bang one recently, aren't worth it. Chase your dreams because those things make you better and you want to be better. Women? lol unless you are a top percent guy or just above average looks, be ready to treat the relationship as a second job and not something fun

It may be an age difference thing too since idk your age and I'm 24.

"I drive through my neighborhood (someone else drove me because of course I’m that much of a loser) and I see a attractive as hell looking high school guy, probably 4 or 5 years younger than me, walking with 2 other girls at his side. This just made me completely realize how much of a horrific failure I am, and how much the average person has over me.

This guy is a winner, a champ and a fucking adonis. He is better and superior to me in every single conceivable way. He didn’t have to spend years and years of meticulous self improvement and therapy to get to where he is, he just did it naturally. No amount of self improvement or accomplishment can ever truly catch me up to someone who’s fucking pulling friends and girls when he’s 17 or 18. Nothing, no amount of improvement or self care, can ever truly compare to an average person who has built themselves up naturally their entire lives without putting in extreme amounts of effort. None of my therapy or improvement goals I’ve achieved matter or are significant in any capacity when there are people like him doing more with himself than I ever could hope do just totally naturally. He’s probably gotten laid as well like the rest of the average population.

I’m going to quit my job, throw away all of my possessions and things that brought me “joy”, stop deluding myself into ever believing that I can be talented at anything, throw away the dinner I am making before it’s even done and go to bed hungry, and stop pretending that I’m not the complete dead end of my bloodline. The world would not lose anything of value if I didn’t succeed, and that guy will have one less loser in the world he has to deal with. I want to punish and belittle myself like the rest of the world has.

Nobody wants an autistic, ugly, fuck up virgin loser in any capacity. Nobody want anyone who has any sort of issues or problems or isn’t succeeding 24/7 or doesn’t have their entire lives figured out by the time they leave school. Nobody wants anyone who’s anything short of a perfect neurotypical person. Nobody wants anyone with a body count in the dozens and doesn’t fuck like an absolute stallion. There is absolutely zero tolerance or acceptance of people who are inexperienced or unsuccessful. I genuinely wish something horrible happens to me, and that guy and a bunch of other people are there to laugh and insult me."

Before I work through what you’ve just told me…. I just want you to BREATHE. Nothing matters in the moment more than just getting through and coping with the pain you’re in right now. I know it’s hard, I’ve been there. Each low feels like you’ve hit the the ground, but then the floor breaks through and you’re at a whole new low. Even if you might not believe that even coping using healthy ways(meditating, grounding yourself, taking a walk, journaling, screaming into a pillow) because of your feelings toward yourself, I am telling you that you must come out the other end, because once your pain has subsided, you’ll be able to reflect on your reality with a much clearer lens. It can be hard to to notice this in the mindset you’re in, but DESPITE EVERYTHING you exist. That is a sign of strength, of resilience. You might not be able to see it, but I am here to tell you that there is incredible strength, resilience in the fact that, despite everything, you are still here. You exist, therefore you triumphed. And you’ve done it before, so I know you have what it takes. I’m only asking you to give me your best shot, just one more time, to get yourself through this. You got this. I believe in you.

Recognize that your thoughts, while they feel incredibly real, are not always right. How do you not know that he has gone through a lot of shit too? Maybe his mother just passed away, maybe he needs to have open heart surgery soon, maybe his best bud just ghosted him, maybe he stubbed his toe that morning.

Try and block out societies measurements for success. In terms of looks, money, sexual partners all of it. You gotta focus on you. Don’t throw everything away. But do change what needs to be changed. If your job or anything makes you unhappy. Work towards changing it. You said no amount of self improvement will change anything, but that’s not true. The world needs you because I guarantee there is a unique point of view, or style, or ideas or something that is special and can only be brought into existence by you. It’s so hard to try and block all that out, but work towards loving yourself my brother. Society is slow to appreciate the finer details. However, If you work on loving yourself. And treating yourself right by paying attention to what you eat, how you talk to others, physical exercise, self love through everything you do. You will become more confident. And people will be drawn to you. I’ve never been the cool guy that was magnetic with women, but who cares if this dude has some surface level attraction to some high school girls. I get by knowing that the people who do like me, and the girls I do get attention from (few) actually see something in me past the surface. Realistically you gotta put yourself out there and love yourself. If you see no value in yourself , nobody else will either. In stead of dropping everything and wanting bad for yourself. Start new things and maybe meet new people. I don’t think you really want yourself to suffer, because I’ve been there and thought that and it sounds like you’re already suffering. So take a deep breath. Work everyday to see the value that you have, work on improving yourself as well. Hitting the gym and doing jiu jitsu is a great way to improve confidence as well. Get lost in something you really like. So many people are just as lost as anyone else, even if they don’t seem like it. If you find something you love to do and get really into it. People feed off that energy and passion. Also straight up screw with hat everyone things. That dudes life ain’t peaches and rainbows either. We all have our issues. Keep your head up dude!

I’m not classically trained in art I dropped it as soon as I could in school. I’ve been facing a lot of difficulties with various mental conditions that I’ve been really struggling to communicate to my loved ones. Because of this I’ve been going out into my garage and painting to try and express myself without the need for words. These are paintings of how I think I’d look if people could visibly see the pain I’m experiencing. I’m slowly learning but feel that I’d like people to see my art even though I’m just starting out because the art isn’t about being perfect for me but instead I hope it will help someone on here feel seen and be able to relate in some way to the emotions in the paintings. I feel that way when I listen to music so I hope I can help others with my kind of art. Thank u for reading :) I recommend trying some kind of art form to help give purpose to the pain.	bluestarfishies	post	22.99500636435763	female	White	0.0014048904413357377	na	na	na	12	malementalhealth

"**How I went from being hospitalized twice and being on suicide watch to being happy and successful in my life, having control of my emotions, not letting my thoughts control me, coaching, consulting and more:**

*YOU SEE IN 2013…..*

• I had a random surgery and afterwards my entire life changed for the worse

• I had multiple freak physical ailments that prevented me from contributing to society that no doctor could figure out

• I was at a new doctor every few days with no answers and quickly fell into a deep dark depression

• I was hospitalized a few months after my surgery, put on suicide watch and I still couldn’t cope or figure out how I would make it to the next day

• I couldn’t sleep, talk, eat or do any of the normal everyday things humans do… I thought my life was truly over

Well, after being hospitalized a second time in 2016, I knew something had to be different, so I focused on just a few VERY simple principles and everything since then has changed:

1.) I learned simple tactics to help calm my anxiety attacks and to prevent overthinking which led be down a rabbit hole

2.) I got educated on medication and different forms of therapy

3.) I got educated on healthy vs harmful relationships between me, myself and I as well as with others in my inner circle

4.) I learned a variety of different lifestyle habits that helped stabilize my mood

Starting in January 2017, I was not having suicidal thoughts, I was able to wake up every day and accomplish things I couldn’t before, not having to worry about not sleeping, eating or functioning at a high level, lost 50 pounds, got a job at my college’s newspaper, coached and educated others on my story among many other things…. and if I can do it, ANYONE CAN!!!

I don’t care if you’re 18 and feel like todays going to be the last day of your life, OR if you’re 70 and haven’t been able to accomplish life goals you might want to still achieve and still can’t get out of the everyday rut where there’s no light at the end of the tunnel….

Stay the course and keep pushing forward. Keep learning – keep your discipline – and keep taking scary amounts of action.

You’re already there – time just hasn’t caught up yet!

Let’s make this the BEST WEEK EVER,

"Probably not, no. Your situation is completely different. Becoming depressed due to a physical condition makes perfect sense, and is also something that tends to improve as the condition does. So now because you're happy and successful you think you've ""been through it"" and have all the answers. What if your condition didn't get better? What if that period when you were at your worst went on for years, decades? Would you still be posting this? Nope. Congrats on getting lucky I guess. 

>You’re already there – time just hasn’t caught up yet!

Actually time has caught up, time has passed me by, that's half of my problem. Even if I somehow could overcome everything holding me back and start living normally today, it's already too late. I've missed out on everything that matters in life. No point learning how to go fast after the race is over."	rostry05	reply	na	na	na	0.0011944546131417155	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"It was barely hope to begin with, honestly. But I just can’t fucking feel things properly, so finding things is hard, and I’ve lost everything I had. My family was shit from the start, except for my sister, who got hit by a bus and died last year. I have no job, no goals, no hobbies, absolutely nothing at all that even works as a fucking distraction from the fact that I just don’t want to be here. Pathetic as it sounds, literally all I was living for for the past year was a girl who doesn’t even talk to me anymore.

We used to be pretty close, I guess, but things got messy when I got feeling for her she didn’t share. Then I had to move away, and the distance made it messier. Then I moved back, and I just didn’t know how to reach out again, and I felt like she wouldn’t want me to anyway. Then my sister died and I was just fucking alone, and I ended up trying to go to the pub where this girl worked because I had no one else, but it felt so unfair, so instead I just went in there and ignored her for some fucking reason.

Then I started running into her at the gym, but we kept ignoring each other. Eventually I tried to explain it over text, but I fucked that up too, and she didn’t reply. I let almost a full year pass, just hoping she’d eventually come back with at least a reason if I gave her space, but then she switched gyms, and that just really fucking hurt, and I feel like it’s all my fault, even though I don’t know what I could’ve been doing at the gym to make her feel the need to do that. And I tried to reach out via text again one last time, only to find out that she also blocked my number, so now I’ve just been completely abandoned by someone who once cared about me and told me she’d never do exactly that to me, and I don’t even have a reason or an explanation. She’s just gone.

In the year since all this has been going on, I started talking to someone on here, trying to make some kind of actual human connections, and on paper all the elements are there, but I just can’t fucking feel it, and now even that has turned to shit because my constant emotional instability from both the abandonment shit, and the fact that I just want a human connection and cant fucking feel it at all has caused this new friend to need a break from me because I’ve been making her feel like shit too.

I’m just fucked. I have nothing and no one. I’m on a planet that exists in the same physical plane as everyone else’s world, but it’s also just completely disconnected and no one can get through. I have no hope left. I feel nothing by pain and regret. I just don’t want to fucking be here anymore, nothing I do makes it better, I’ve been on dozens of medications, I’ve been in therapy for 4 years, I’ve tried finding connections, I’ve tried being alone, but I just keep getting worse and worse, and even the shit that I don’t directly fuck up myself gets taken from me by just continuing to be alive. I just can’t do this shit anymore."	VeryMentallyStable	post	17.868143656016315	male	White	0.9994431138038635	na	na	na	3	malementalhealth

Am I a villain? Am I defective? I feel abandoned- prayers don't even work. Am I so wrapped up in my own pain that I can't see anyone else's? But my mind feels incredibly numb today- and people I'd spent a lot of time with and had an emotional connection don't talk to me anymore. This apathy is the worst. I don't even have my vices. I don't care to go to the strip club, look at porn, or see a sex worker for escape or relief. I feel myself caring for nothing at all. I feel so numb. Today I showed in about an hour late for work as I had been struggling to read and comprehend an article online. I am now hoarding lots of articles I see online- but feel myself incapable to take much of it in. A good portion is from Psychology Today- but since I feel so numb looking at it what good does it do? All the official people in medicine are gaslighting me and my experience. Science gaslights that I'm struggling reading. I feel such a failure- just swarmed in by the massive amount of content being generated in this world- and feeling numb and like I cannot grow anymore. My relationships all fall apart because I often feel bad like today where all I want to do is turn off the lights and cry- and wish desperately never to wake up again. And there's the lack of communication and lack of me being able to feel safe when as soon as I get close that person just disappears. I don't keep texting or trying. I play pretty calm and not affected.	Pawnset	post	21.215865079351374	female	White	0.999290943145752	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth

"Tl;Dr Dad is a coward. Raised me to be a coward as well. How do I actually grow some balls and not be anxious all the time. 

I M 22 have always been scared of everything and my dad is the reason. Basically this guy has never taught me how to stand up for myself. Always to me to ""avoid"" or ""ignore"" anything and everything bad that happened to me. When i eventually learnt how to stand up for myself on my own this dude along with some bad experiences made me become this scared weak little guy again. 

I would give some incidents as examples of what my dad did and how they f-ed me up but i really don't have the mental energy to remember them right now. 

I'm a decently attractive guy as girls have shown interest in me and my sister keeps telling me that I do look good and that her female friends have been shocked when they learnt that I didn't and never had a gf. And yes I obviously want a gf but I never had the courage to ask a girl out and even the girls who had shown interest lost their interest once they realised how weird and anxious I am. I have also been told I have a deep and commanding voice. The reason I'm saying this is because my personality is quite literally the only reason I'm such a loser and idk what to do. 

My dad is the type of dude who only cares about what other people think. For example, there is a neighbour who would always walked their rottweiler without a belt/chain. We have a few pet cats and at the time this happened we had a kitten. The cats would used to go out outside just to chill and sometimes when my neighbour came with his dog the dog would obviously chase the cats. My cats would always get scared and climb a tree or something. And this piece of shit neighbour would stand there an laugh instead of taking the dog elsewhere while my mom would freak out and try to save the cat. One day i heard my mom cry and I came outside the house and saw the dog eating my kitten. I was beyond fucking furious and I began bellowing at the lady (neighbour's mom) who was walking the dog. And yeah I kind of created a scene, but when the dust settled and I came back inside the house you know what my dad said? He said that the neighbors will start talking about how we created a scene! Like dude your fucking cat just died and you're worried about what the neighbours think?
He started giving some goddamned lecture about how we shouldn't get angry and that upstanding citizens like us shouldn't get into fights and shit. 
(Oh yeah he has this goddamn delusion that people think we are a prestigious family, even though we are kinda broke and the neighbors can always hear my dad and mom arguing )

I have been brought up like this, but don't think that my dad is some thorofin type dude who had a violent past and is now trying to be nice. Not at all. He is a piece of shit. He has threatened to beat up my mom on a few occasions, always verbally abuses her. I remember once when she began bawling her eyes out when I was kid and this disgusting piece of shit had the audacity to come to me and tell that nothing is wrong and that mom will be fine. He had beaten my sister when she was in 2nd grade to the point where she pissed herself and HE LAUGHED when he saw that. (My sister told me this she is older than me) 

My sister also went through the exact same things as me regarding bullying and shit. We get bullied, we stand up for ourselves, we come home and tell that to our parents, dad tells us that we are wrong for doing that. 

I'm sorry I might sound like an incel when I say this but girls have some leeway when it comes to being weak/scared. The world forgives them sometimes. Some guys even find it cute and feel this need to protect such girls. That's not the case when it comes to guys. Men are expected to be confident. I'm not saying girls only prefer alpha  af, dominating guys but they certainly don't like weak and anxious guys. 

My sister married her husband because he was the total opposite of our dad and I'm glad for her. He is basically what an ""alpha male"" is. Or should I say Sigma? because he's not the loud mouth type. Whatever. 

But basically he won't back out from a fight, won't think twice to insult someone who insults him, etc. He told me a story of his childhood. He got hit by a kid in the neighborhood and so he came home upset and told his dad. His dad took him by the arm dragged him to where the kid was and made him beat up that kid right in front of him. Hardcore, maybe even traumatizing for some, but he has fucking balls today and doesn't give a shit about anything. 

My Brother in law came to my dad for help some company he was making (my dad's a lawyer) and apparently my dad made him doubt everything shook his confidence. My dad doesn't outright say shit like ""you can't do it"" or anything but he says things like ""it's going to he very difficult"" or ""you better hope this doesn't happen"". 

I was telling my sister how I saw this video where they talk about parents who don't teach their kids how to stand up to bullies or atleast don't even hear their children out and that causes the children to grow up with confidence issues. That's when my sister told me about how her husband/ my BIL told her that her/my dad is scared about everything in the world and that he can see the same look in my eyes. When my sister told me this I realised that's why I get picked on by everyone, that's why I always get ignored and not taken seriously. It's because of my confidence and my dad is to blame for it.

I have severe confidence issues. Like about everything. My looks, my intelligence, my physical strength (I'm skinny, have asthma and have always been weak. I've gotten into a few fights. Stood my ground except for this one where I really got my ass kicked.) Me being insecure about my memory and smartness has allowed me to be gaslit and manipulated so many times. And my insecurity of being physically weak has stopped me from standing up for myself (verbally) for so long that I have literally forgotten how to enforce boundaries. Having shitty friends who bully me didn't help my case either. I have social anxiety too. 

I of course can't keep crying about the past and the present, so what can I do to build confidence?

Others will probably suggest some mental techniques to gain confidence. But for me the best one was to simply make a conscious decision what to fix. And then commit to it.

Find the best resources, subreddits and start implementing the knowledge.

Remember -you don’t need anyone’s permission to be confident. Just as you don’t need a track record of successes.

All you need is to make a conscious decision that from now on you’re gonna act confident despite anything that happens.

"Are you still in contact with your friends? You say they are bullying you.

If you still are you have to ask yourself this: would you act to act like they do to you to them? If the answer is yes do you think they would take it on the chin and realize it's only fair? And finally: assuming the answer is yes to the previous, are they people you genuinely like around or are you around them merely to not be alone?

I never had a lot of friends but there have been times where I Ve tried to stick to people merely so i feel in a group, and it never worked out, and i could feel very well they didn't want me in. 

But i know that just telling you to cut off bad people doesn't actually bring good people in: i m certainly no expert on that and it also depends on what you are doing in life,. Personally most of the people i keep up with are people with shared hobby or very old friend, but i don't really have anything groundbreaking on that front.

As for standing up for yourself: you are an adult and i don't know whether you're still in school or not but whatever the case the good news is generally, adults don't go out of their way to bully others. If they do it probably isn't gonna be physical and more social(either spreading rumors, or avoiding you,  or things of that order.). 

I think aside of doing things that raise your objective abilities (studying, working out) and going out of your way to go into social situations (our social skills only get worse by not practicing them), what it means to be confident is that you can live with either outcomes that comes to you. I m not saying you shouldn't care about anything, that's just apathy.

"I'm sorry to hear about that man. I can relate to some of this with my mom but not to the same degree. 

One of the things that helped me with confidence was MMA. You could try boxing, BJJ, or any type of combat sport. It does a lot to boost your confidence.

Next thing I would say is if you can, and even if it's part time, find a job where you have to talk to people. Don't get me wrong, its extremely hard at first, but having to talk to customers regularly with help with your anxiety in my experience. It took me about a week for my nerves to settle and get use to it. I worked in restaurants and it helped

Make sure you have your boundaries set and stick to your guns. Holding up your boundaries is extremely important to people not walking all over you. If friends or other people can't respect your boundaries, they're not worth being around.

Lastly, taking that step to not being a ""coward"" takes time. You really have to challenge your brain to work on changing.

"Sounds like you are choosing to deflect about your issues and blaming your father, rather than buck up and take accountability for what you can control. The longer you focus on only blaming, the longer you will be stagnant. 

You are 22, you are too old to play the teenager game of “everything wrong with me is my parents fault.” Mind you, this is coming from someone who grew up with abusive narcissist parents. I wasted too much time deflecting rather than introspecting. You cannot do anything about the past. The present is yours, to set your course for the future. So get going. It is only useful to dwell on the past long enough to identify problems, in the interest of finding solutions. Any longer spent in the past will turn into depression and debilitate you from progress. 

I think it would be beneficial for most young men to learn how to ignore things and avoid unnecessary conflict. A single bad moment can trigger a loss of self-control and cause a man to lose his freedom, or his life. 

Perhaps your father was trying to impart upon you a superpower of calmness or mindfulness. Self-control is a necessary skill. To be able to understand your sphere of influence, and be able to put things into perspective… these skills will help keep you from being manipulated, and from becoming hateful and dark. 

Confidence will come in time and with practice. As you say, you are an attractive guy. You are not hopelessly hideous or disfigured. So don’t obsess about this. Instead, do what you can do to socialize more. The more you interact with others (in person!), the easier it will be to socialize, and your confidence will rise. Step outside your comfort zones as often as possible! Have a month of “Yes”, where you vow to not shy away from any social event (so long as it’s not a harmful event). 

Get a new notebook and keep track of your social progress- how many new friends you are making. How many casual conversations you are having. How you feel each day. You will see a steady increase in your confidence as you exercise those social muscles. 

Also, you should not let cats go outside. They are not native species and devastate bird/lizard populations, and they’re at risk of getting killed by dogs, coyotes, etc.

It sounds like you're terrified of rejection and what others may think of you.  Learning how to take rejection is hard but would give you so much more freedom.

Start by doing some small things that make you uncomfortable in public,  such as doing something that would attract attention.

"I am in a similar position to you, although not exactly. My parents are both abuse survivors and so have spent their lives trying to self regulate and going to therapy ect. Hadn't done much of that work prior to having me so I didn't develop the strategys for self regulation until I too went to therapy and started to implement the things I learned.

These are the best techniques I've learned for self regulation.

1. Disengage with the relationship you have with your parents, they are both disregulated and this will have a heavy influence on your regulation. One of the benefits of being male is that you can, and are even expected to, distance yourself from your parents. Your father is indeed a weak man, any man who threatens the females in his family with physical violence is pathetic and lacks control. The reasoning behind him undermining your strength and undermining your BIL strength is potentially because he feels if you were strong you would challenge/confront him about his behaviour and he is desperate not to loose control, does that sound like it could be the case?

2. You need to learn how to regulate your vagus nerve, this is the thing that sends the safety signals in your body. Basically you need to program your body and mind to feel confident in your capacity to manage life, handle yourself and that you are in an environment that doesn't hold any immidiate danger. The way I did this was to:

Learn a martial art, combat sport, or self defence. I practice BJJ and Krav Maga. Combine this with some strength training and this will do several things. It will improve your posture and that dorsal reflex is what controls your vagus nerve, along with breathing, do some research on it, very interesting. It will program your brain (once you learn) to feel safe and secure knowing you can defend yourself physically. Krav Maga is brilliant because it is quick to learn and very effective at self defense against multiple attackers. Martial arts like jujitsu take a lot more time but are brilliant for breathing, posture and confidence. Both are great for making freinds who are strong and confident and the more strong, confident people you have in your life, the more your nervous system will tune to theirs.

Get confidence in other areas of your life too, so anything you feel you haven't got control over, make a plan to get control over! Finances, housing, relationships... Do some research/reading and tackle it.

The best way to gain confidence is exposure therapy, so pick 3 things that absolutely scare the living shit out of you and GRADUALLY work towards conquering those fears, take small, steady steps.

Confidence is a muscle, training will take dedication, planning and continuous action, but over time it will grow and get stronger.

I used to be agoraphobic, suicidal, depressed, anxious, have no social life, no boundaries and was basically a quivering wreck of a human being. I am now a very highly functioning human being with great friends, an outgoing job and a very fit body who has great confidence in herself.

A couple of good resources I used were:
Jordan Peterson
Tony Robbins

It’s not about fighting, standing up for yourself. It’s your life they are trying to disrupt, and as soon as they do, you no longer control your life. 

That control got stripped from them, and they bring it to you. 

They’re the bitch, which is why they name call you for saying nah I’m not indulging your feminine tendencies.

"Last night I did a solid amount of the truck alone because I’m the only overnight worker besides my one day off when they hire some old lady to hold it down on my one day off. Anyway, I was putting a dent in my task last night and a woman from another section of my store asked me to put away some buckets for her. 

I mean I’ve done it before once in the past but because of this she asked again. I was a little thrown off because #1 I have my own truck to do and you see this also #2 they are from your section and aren’t heavy lol they’re empty. 

Well anyway I set an alarm last night and put away about 15 of them. Big ol empty stack I noticed. Immediately got back to my specific task and absolutely crushed it. only for boss man to come in and give me a classic nothing as usual. I’m used to that but anyway, on to just now. 

I come into work today despite not feeling well and obviously I can’t call out because I’m the only ON worker. The girl comes up to me and says hey you didn’t put all of those away for me last night. I told her I put away a huge stack and honestly thought that was it. 

She said no it wasn’t but it’s ok. I immediately said I’m sorry about that, I was on my grind last night but I’m sick as a dog tonight. She said Ohhh…ok it’s not a big deal. I told her I’m sorry and that’s just the god honest truth. I thought those 15 empty boxes were really everything. 

She said “it’s ok…it happens”…In a fairly passive (I don’t believe what you’re saying type of tone. 
Fast forward to about an hour or two later andddddd

She comes up to me 5 minutes ago before she clocked out and told me to “not forget to finish bringing those empty baskets out back”. Mind you, she’s been here for hours and is now just leaving.

 Not my section and not feeling well like i told her but who cares? She’s leaving so don’t forget! get the fuck up and work. Isn’t this what men are for? Smfh. I told you I was sick and instead of putting the rest away today you waited for me to come in and scorn me over it. Nice. 

We made a deal yesterday. Today is a new day. I’m sick and it was always your section. They’re not even heavy. Sure I didn’t get all of them yesterday but I did a fat stack for you. Idk if I made you a “promise” I told you I didn’t feel well today but fuck me…get moving. Smfh have a good night. 

My point here is that basically….even if you’re sick and genuinely don’t feel well as a man? You better drink some Gatorade and become useful again quick because people don’t care. You live to provide! 

Corporate expects you to work hard tonight regardless if you’re alone and new here, oh yeah…and as for that paycheck when the time comes? Step up, be a man and pay for whatever the fuck needs to be paid for. You were born to succeed in whatever goals were expected under the conditional love of fathers expectations. 

Once you shit the bed in that section of responsibility because he’s a bully and nothing was ever good enough? Congrats! You’re now old enough to move out and financially provide for your significant other. Be a man. Be useful…be strong…be stoic and be better. So yeah…Get a Gatorade and get going!

"So...

This is going to be a bit all over the place so please forgive me.

In addition, **big disclaimer**, I am trying my best to express myself in a way that explains my situation and worldview, but I know that I am generalizing. I rarely participate in this kind of discussions since it really affects me emotionally so I apologize for any missteps that I might make while explaining my situation.

Basically, I have a lot of mental health issues for which I am getting treatment.

These issues do not live in a vacuum, some of them compound with things related to gender and sexual identity.

For example, I have been moderately-to-severely depressed for the last 5 and a half years, and this has been a major impediment in my friendships and romantic life.

First of all because being severly depressed is a major impediment for **anyone**'s friendships and romantic life.

But I also think there is, **in addition**, a gender component here, because **as a heterosexual man** **I think** that culturally I am ""supposed"" to be ""manly"", confident, risk-taking, make the first move, competent, etc, on top of that, **it has been my experience** that because of social norms, people, and in particular, girls, rarely act proactively with me or reach out to me, although they might respond well when I act proactively with them or reach out to me, this includes long established friendships and not just romantic interests.

**I am not saying** that other collectives have it easier, I am saying that **being a depressed (heterosexual) man has a particular set of challenges** with some key differences from a generic situation, or the same situation for someone else.

Furthermore, I do not consider myself a very masculine man, I do not exhibit what, **in my opinion**, are **traditional** masculine traits such as competition, assertiveness, agression, stubbornness, etc. I am emotional, empathic, insecure, soft-spoken, etc. And **I am happy with this**.

So I find myself at this weird impasse, where if I look for friendships and dating advice, because I have long struggled with that area of my life, I get one of three possible results:

1. ""u have to love urself first lol""
2. Generic advice that fails to address the particular challenges that a non-masculine depressed heterosexual man might have when dating, making friends or combating loneliness.
3. Sexist weirdos.

I could go on a rant about (1) but let's just say that it is invalidating and doesn't help me.

(2) fails to help me because the advice is a bit tone-deaf and supposes that it is applicable to anyone in any situation and I often think, ""this won't work for me because of X"".

(3) fails to help me because they want me to be someone who I am not: to be more ""masculine"", to ""ditch"" some of my personality traits and artificially staple some other personality or whatever. Also they are sexist weirdos.

So at the end of the day, my relationships feel like a barren landscape and my romantic life is non-existant, which feeds back into my mental health problems.

My question is:

Is there some guidance for people like me?

More specifically:

**Is there a content creator out there who talks about the issues someone like me has in friendships and romantic life?**

I hope this makes sense and thank you for reading."	East_Airport_4390	post	23.586883058062654	female	White	0.9864984750747681	na	na	na	9	malementalhealth

Yes depressed men are overlooked but the one thing (a good thing) about it is it is changeable - it just takes a loottt of work and pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. Anytime in my life I’ve felt down it’s usually because I’m also isolating. Depression is usually a hyper focus on one’s own emotions which is why it’s good to reach out…and a 1/10th chance is better than none…you only need 1. Thing is you don’t see others inadequacies or failures because all you see are your own - rest assured we all have them. Good luck!

"If you can afford therapy, do it. I was always very skeptical of it but I foind myself in financial security over the past few years and decoded to throw mpney at therapy just for the ""what could hurt?""

And it has done me wonders. I did the Betterhelp route as my small town didn't habe many therapists available. But the therapist I got paired with on Betterhelp has actually surprised me. He shoots me stright (I asked specifically for a male).

Outside of that, from everything I read here, you seem to be on the right track. (Something I came to realize over the past two months through therapy as well).

We have a lot of overlap in our situations. I'm a hetero white male in the USA, 33 years old. I also do not fall into the 'traditionally masculine qualities'. I'm quite emtional, open about it, empathic, care more than I should about others, quiet, keep my self, very introverted, struggle with dating, etc etc. Politically, I identify as an independent who tends to lean left, but I do hold a few conservative values. When debating leftists, I'm the furthest right leaning person in the group, but when debating conservatives, I'm the most left leaning person in the group. Gets me hot waters sometimes, but whatever, I believe what i believe.

I like to believe we all struggle with these things, some of us just carry the burden a little easier.

The people who tell you to put yourself out there are absolutely correct. You can't win if you don't play. I also detest being told this because it doesn't address the issue. But I also acknowledge that if I can't identify the problem directly, the advice won't be direct either.

I've been single for 9-ish years. 8 of them quite intentionally. Finalky just said ""I have to do some work on me first"". And let me tell ya, once I quit trying to date, women started signalling me, a few were quite blunt and direct in their desires. And I shot them all down over the last 8 years. Stuck to my guns about self improvement. Missed several opportunities from doing this, but I don't entirely regret it.

I find myself quite happy being alone. I just want peace. To be content with myself and my situation.

There's a lot of quality information to be found in the Redpill community, but I say/suggest this with a HUGE caveat. You have to detach yourself from all the hate, cynicism, manipulation, resentment, etc, that comes with that community. Therapist has reassured me mulitple times that my outlook on this (as I am quite skeptical of Redpill) is quite healthy and not 'the norm'. You HAVE to detach from that part of it. But Redpill does have some healthy advice on body language, signals, self improvement, etc. Just, trim the hate from it.

Dr. K is alright, but like you, I eventually quit watching him. He was a stepping stone to Jordan Peterson. Who, again, you have to detach from his political views. But his self improvement and 'take on responisbility' is absolutely solid advice. His book 12 Rules for Life is full of good advice, all very applicable to 'getting your shit together'. Just let me take another moment to reinforce this...again...you have to be able to detach from the parts that are a bit cringe, his politics.

A recent one I stumbled upon on Youtube is Diary of a CEO. Dude has lots of good conversations with a lot of people about a large variety of topics, and isn't cringe like a lot of creators in the same realm.

Robert Greene is a great author. Any of his books are great. Psychology and human behaviorism realm. 

Carl Jung is older, but it's psychology, so it can open your eyes to yourself a bit. Modern Man In Search Of A Soul. The Undiscovered Self. Those were my two favorites by him. Quick reads as well.

Philosophy content is great too. I dove into Stoicism. Again, Youtube creators are decent for this. I like The Daily Stoic. I also suggest the book Meditations (Marcus Aurelius). Another great read.

I read The Rational Male 'trilogy'. Bit more resentful than others, but he does highlight issues and concerns you will encounter with *some* women. He generalizes and slaps some hateful labels on women. But, terrible women do exist. I found him beneficial because I use to let people walk all over me, so his less-than-stellar stance on women helped temper that part of me. Again, detachment is important here.

The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck is an okay read. Not the best, but it's okay. There's an audiobook version on Youtube.

I'd stay away from dating apps myself, but my therapist has suggested it as a way to put myself out there, as it can act as a stepping stone and a sort of 'exposure therapy'. I struggle with this, but can still wrap my mind around how it could be beneficial. He suggested Bumble as it takes the 'initial contact' onus off of you, women have to reach out first. He also suggested other 'meetup' style apps for hobbies. I like to hike and fish, but My adventure buddy moved with his wife a few years back so I do it solo now instead of with other people.

This was a bit of a ramble. But these are some of the tools I've added to my 'toolbox' and have been beneficial in one way or another. And let me just beat the dead horse one more time, that detachment is important. You're allowed to 'trim the fat' so-to-speak. You don't have to adopt everything, you are allowed to only apply the parts of these things that actually apply to you, without sacrificing parts of yourself along the way that you don't want to.

Again, bit of a ramble, but hope it helps.

You got this."	East_Airport_4390	reply	na	na	na	0.9864984750747681	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"Hey man

I am pushing 40 and a lot of what you said resonated with me

Personally I have been looking at my life and relationships realising I'm a giving person, but that my energy is limited

If ask you to take a look at how much energy you have, how much you are doing for others, and how much you are investing in yourself. 

Make yourself a priority each day. I'm not sure what self care looks like for you but for me at the moment I am focused on diet and exercise. Really this is just a way for me to organise my health and sleep, yet it is all connected so an improvement in one of these might help there areas. 

You're an insightful and self-searching person, and I'd recommend paying attention to the way you are introspecting - recognise the qualities you like in yourself, such as being soft spoken as you mentioned. 

Gentleness really is a beautiful trait and I personally admire it greatly. 

I was, and am still, a gentle soul, yet I have become more gruff and uncaring towards myself and towards others over time - and now I'm making a deliberate effort to soften again. 

Looking after your own mental and physical interests first, along with your spiritual or religious interests, and using the benefits of these to energise your social relationships could help you feel more connected to others. 

Your writing shows you to be a bright and empathetic person and this is a really positive sign for building connections with other gentle people."	East_Airport_4390	reply	na	na	na	0.9864984750747681	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"      Hello everyone willing to listen and hopefully give some insight threw personal experience and a strive to be better.
       I'm a 24 year old dad of a year old, been in this relationship for 5 years (6 years if u count the hiccups) now I have a bit of stuff that is crippling my mental health and ik for a fact the stress of all of it is killing me. 
      I honestly can start with saying the fact I graduated high-school 6 years ago and it's gone so fast is one of the most scary things to me. I have spent that 6 years smoking to much weed and working in the restaurant business. From 17 to now I went from dishwasher to now I feel like I make pretty dang good pizzas and other food involved in the line area. But other then that I haven't lived. Thought about my future besides-
* get money
* stay with my girl
* smoke weed
* play video games
     I only ever had one best friend and his girl and all 3 of us just smoked and played video games. I got tiered of them bc I would like them to come to my house or go out together and actually do something. So I haven't talked to them the past 2 years bc I feel they didn't offer anything besides some people who I use to know. So just me and my girl. She has friends that I don't mesh with. And her family I use to love but now sense there apart of this biker group thing they are always doing that stuff. But now I don't talk to my mom because she has all my life choices her shitty boyfriends over me and my brother. After are last fight and having my son I know that's not what I want in my sons and my life. Sense I pretty much cut most of them out I have no one
      I do mean no one (besides my son which I tell myself every time but he is only 1) me and my Fiance (sense I also finally purposed this past holiday season which is big for me because I don't take that forever commitment lightly, it scares me to trust someone so much as is a child ik but we wanted him.) We are growing apart. She saids she doesnt feel things anymore. Like emotions, which i completely understand because i have killing my emotions too. I just don't think we are much in lobe anymore tho. She's been pretty much living for me the past couple years.I haven't felt much emotions in the past few years. I use to cry and FEEL the situation or circumstances, whatever I was going threw I felt it. I didn't even like cry at the birth of my son which I fucking hate myself for but I have been stressed for so long now. Living up to peoples expectations. Always trying so hard to just fail so miserably, the negative after effects of being a pushed away child, how stupid negative my dad always was because he just dug his own grave at having me at 17, never having a actual male role model. 
     The little things r what happen to me all the time and it's the little things that kill me. For better or for worse. Examples being - losing every item I own, spilling something because I'm clumsy, how I trip over  the cats. I believe the world is out to get me. It's very hard some days because it's one thing after another after another. And I get very angry and suppress all my emotions with weed but my negative attitude and my quick temper anymore... weed doesn't help anymore I know. But I'm still so resentful of everything and everyone but just as i said the little things kill me. I also would just love a real hug from my fiance that I wasn't expecting, someone I use to know that fell off with to reach out, someone to talk to, to be recognized that I don't have anything together but I still be realized that I bust my ass in other areas and just need to be reminded on who I really am and to stop the stressing over the stupid little things.  
     I just feel as if everything around me crumbles me more because I don't act like how I truly feel and want to. I was always taught to just go along, to don't do anything that I'd normally do, to always think before I speak. Which in turn I really don't know who I truly am because I put on a mask for each person for each situation to please them and make things easier. But even if I truly speak my mind certain things happen and I just am a stuttering mess because I truly don't know what I want to say and I have all these thoughts all the time.
     Paranoid or what call u I can't trust no one. I think I'm always being cheated on, or get angry if certain people have fun with out me because i don't ever have fun. I sit at home and be a dad or I go to work. I don't show the love I have for my fiance. But even if I tried to go out and have fun I don't have friends so it'd have to be with my fiance who yet again I don't mesh with her friends or her family much anymore.
    I'm trapped in my head always and think to much. I just wanna go back and try to fix it all because I know I went wrong somewhere. If it my relationship with the fiance or do something different as a dad or in school or in life. I have it all wrong and it crippling me, my relationship, my son, my mental health, my body, my attitude. If don't change soon I'll end up running away or killing myself because it's just been to long."	RogueVaultBoy	post	22.17742289850868	female	White	0.9942625164985657	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth

"Hi there,

I am sorry to hear that you have had to go through so much at such a young age. I can only imagine how much you must be hurting right now. You've had your fair share. Life can definitely be extremely challenging at times but it is only temporary. It may not seem like it is temporary right now but it will pass. You are stronger than you think and as the person who replied earlier said it will make you stringer and you will be more prepared later on. When challenges come up you will have developed a skillet for how to handle them and navigate through them. When others are freaking out you will be able to handle situations with ease. It may not seem like it now but be patient. I would also encourage you to seek help if you are thinking of suicide.  Things can get better and there are other better options out there 

I went through a fair amount in my life. Was abused by parents for many years, parents constantly threatened to get rid of me, spent time in a home as a child. Had mental health issues, substance abuse issues etc. It has all made me stronger and more able to deal with things. I had many dark years where I never thought the dark clouds would go away but eventually they do and you are more well prepared. Not going to lie there are always challenges throughout life but you become better adapt at handling them. If you would like to chat further please message me. You are in my thoughts and prayers."

Hey guys, came in here to ask for some advice on what to do since I don’t know anyone in real life that would give me advice. I’m 19 years old, and have been in a toxic household situation for about 1.5 years. It’s just gotten progressively worse and I feel like this place has me chained to the point where I can’t progress in anything in life or be happy. I haven’t seen my friends in over a year now, have been pretty much isolated and depressed. I’ve tried to get along with my family members here but they don’t seem to care whenever I say I don’t feel good mentally and from there all the drama and toxic fights start again. If I want to be happy my only option at this point is to either move out and not see them again or join the army to be away from here for a long time. I have been working my ass off on my online business since I was 15 so I am lucky enough to have the means to move out, but I feel a sense of guilt whenever I think of actually moving out and only speaking to them on text every once in a while. I just wanna move out, make friends, work hard and be happy without being dragged into toxic fights and being told I can’t make shit of my life without hurting them (too much). What do you think I should do? Should I feel guilty for just getting the fuck out and keeping contact through text so I don’t have to be dragged down along with the toxic drama and environment? Really been in this dilemma for a while. I’m talking about not seeing them for years so it’s tough. Let me know your guys’ thoughts, much appreciated	Remarkable-Cycle-725	post	36.10396614960075	male	White	0.998399555683136	na	na	na	3	malementalhealth

Think about it like this, in 5 years, do you still want to be where you are now and doing what you’re doing now? If that’s not the case, then change is necessary. You’re 19 so I totally understand, leaving home is terrifying. But it can also be really gratifying. I spent a couple years during the pandemic stuck with my family at home, unable to get a job and move out. While my parents are fine people, living together was getting more and more toxic for me and I finally decided to just pull the trigger and move to NYC. It’s been a year since then and I couldn’t be happier. I have a new job I like, a girlfriend I plan on marrying soon, etc. all of which was possible just because I changed my settings to somewhere where I was free to be who I wanted to be. From what I’m reading here, you seem to be a really independent and capable person, and I think you will thrive in a new environment. Good luck bro.

">I’ve tried to get along with my family members here but they don’t seem to care

>I feel a sense of guilt whenever I think of actually moving out

You feel guilty for people who don't care about you. 

I don't know your exact situation, but that is typical for homes where children have been treated as adults and not being taught anything, and only being used for support. Especially with sons in single mother homes, absent father. Again I don't know your situation.

Are you sure this is only the last 1.5 years or are you being modest? At least my personal experience this can go back much further back. You feel guilty because they made you think that you are supposed to support them. But it's the other way around. You should be supported in growing and finding your way in the world.

Parents can be absolute leaches. Treating their children as their 'friends' to complain to and talk to about subjects they don't need to hear. While the children don't even get the chance to voice their own struggles and share their experiences as a child. You need to escape and cut the tentacles they wrapped around you. They are responsible for themselves. I mean, look at yourself, you can stand on your own feet! So they should be able 10 times that! Upside down world. You owe them nothing.

Anyway that's how I interpret your description. Maybe I'm completely off but I come across similar stories so much and every time it's the same situation.

By the way I'm not surprised you think about the army because you might be drawn to the clear structure and hierarchy they have and provide ground under your feet. However I would think twice about that. Western armies are fighting for the federal reserve petro-dollar. Not for the glorious nation. Don't risk your life for some central bankers."

Yo I'm a teenager, i have a problem with my mind and shit, recently I started having intrusive/obsessive thoughts about my sexual activity aka jerking off, whenever I do that I start saying shit like ""what if I did it wrong"" ""what if I had a ruined orgasm and I have to jerk off again to satisfy myself"" and the big problem is I have an addiction to jerking off and I wanna stop but these thoughts keep making me do it more because I want them to fuck off, I have a fear that whatever I do when I'm in the mood is gonna be associated with sexual stuff so I keep jerking off just to make the thoughts and worries go away but when I do that my mind comes up with more shit of how I probably fucked it up or it's just the same shit over and over again."

"I (M30) have a friend (M32) who I pay D&D with. I really like him and I like hanging out with him. He's a really good dude overall and seems pretty well adjusted. Let's call him ""David"".

I was at David's place the other day and he was talking about hypothetically moving to Columbia, to be with his girlfriend. I asked how they met, and he said they met online playing Fortnite, and they play every night and she's really really good, which is all well and good, but he hasn't ever met her in person.. 

He was talking about going to meet her for the first time soon, but that he had a really good feeling about her etc. Now, this in itself is a little strange (I asked him if he was being careful, lots of scam potential there but he was confident he was being safe), but what gave me pause is when he followed this up with (I'm paraphrasing): 

 ""I can't date American women. They're too hyper feminist, alpha male, and entitled for me. I need someone more submissive and feminine. I have a lot of trauma from living with my narcissistic abusive mother and I can't deal with women who remind me of her"" 

That really gave me pause and I dropped the conversation there, but I'm really conflicted now... Of course his trauma is valid and he has every right to avoid people who remind him of it, but to say that 50% of the people in the country you live in are unsuitable, and you're considering moving away because of that.


I'm deeply conflicted.  On the one hand, I heartily disagree with his statement about American women not being submissive or feminine. I think the US has some of the most ethnographically and culturally diverse populaces in the world (I've lived in two other countries with far less diversity). 


But even putting that aside, I feel like this course of action might set him up for a poor outcome? I'm worried he'll get really deep in with this person before he starts realizing the core differences in the culture. I don't know if he's talked to a therapist about his relationship with his mom, but I feel like working that out as a starting point might be a better idea? Even in conjunction with him pursuing this person?


And finally. Like, realistically, this is none of my business. He's a free person and he has the right to seek happiness in whatever form. Idk if you guys have some advice as to whether I should simply mind my own business or perhaps gently broach the topic with him to find out more, though I'm worried I'm going to come off as patronizing.

That'll be a disaster. Life-threatening level of sheltered.

But it sounds like the actual reason you made this post is that his words made you feel icky because they're something he's *not supposed to talk about*.

"As a guy who's currently dating a Latina, AAAAHAHHAHAHAHA!!! SUBMISSIVE??? LMAOOOO

He's going to be in for a big surprise if he moves to Columbia expecting their women to be ""submit"" to him. Columbians are extremely proud of their culture and heritage and no random gringo is going to change their minds about anything. 

Like yeah, they do have a strong culture around traditional family structures... but that doesn't mean Columbians are meek and won't speak out against their husband doing something they don't like. Those women will straight up throw hands if they feel disrespected, and if they can't physically hurt you, their family will. Their fathers, brothers, and cousins will straight up bury you man.

I want to know what kind of life he believes he would have. Does he think he'll just have a couple of kids and live a quiet life devoid of feminist influence?

"My name is Wael, basically I am a person who have been trying to improve myself for approximately 2 years. I was utterly depressed, due to really bad experiences (suicidal thoughts, depression, family and health issues).But recently I improved my mental health a lot, by making small and smart changes that looks inconsequential and improved in many different aspects in my life. I feel like I just wanna give a hand to people that might have problems with their mental health and feel lonely because nobody talks about it. So even thought I am not a licensed therapist or a pro coach I might help with my personal experience and communication skills.

"When last year ended I managed to get some money from a source.For all of January and around half of February I went to prostitutes every half of week. I just felt very lonely. I don’t have friends, my father died last summer. Things start to add up, you know? But it was a terrible decision. None of the girls I resorted to cared about me, besides giving them money. Although they did help with sexual urges. The way I did it through was pretty meaningless. At the end of February I approached a crush I was having at work. She even met with me. She recently broke up with her bf and isn’t looking for something new. 

I didn’t end up with what I was hoping  for. I reconsidered what I should do. And pushed to exercise more. I used to do something like 7 minutes of cardio. Which really isn’t much. For all of March and what began from April I started doing 10 minutes of cardio and running 2 miles per day. And with 10 minutes of yoga , that’s 30 minutes of exercising daily. It’s probably not much as it sounds. It’s good enough for now as it keeps me active. I also cut off alcohol in this time, as that was another vice for me.

I’m thinking I can approach a woman sometimes again.But I need to learn to take care of me first. And it is important for my depression and anxiety to have coping methods."	costyksimpatic	post	27.390386517307018	male	White	0.9924010038375854	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth

"Begin a new character arc.

Look at Sokka from The Last Airbender.

He started as the useless comic relief character who was basically dead-weight to the team and became a master sword fighter and battle tactician who lead an army to invade the Fire Nation by the end of the show.

Think of an idealistic version of yourself 20, 40, 60 years from now. A version of you who dedicated time to self-improvement and took great but necessary risks to achieve his goals.

Does the old man version of you look frail and docile? Or does this hypothetical version of you refuse to atrophy and can talk for hours around a campfire about all of the different paths you've tried to take in life?

After one of my first breakups, and certainly the most painful one, an older friend invited me to his house. He grows weed in his backyard, is incredibly kind, and everyone in the room pays attention when he has a story to tell. He talked to me about all of the times he has had his heart broken and his dreams shattered in front of him. All of the jobs he got fired from and all of the things he failed at... but there we were, sitting together rolling joints, sipping beers, and laughing about the time he tried to become an astrophysicist despite being terrible at math.

It's okay to be clumsy, it's okay to fail. You will look back on this part of your life and laugh. 

Forgive yourself when you make mistakes and pick yourself up when you fall. It's all part of your character arc."	hellonikhil	reply	na	na	na	0.9993164539337158	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"I have deeply rooted self-esteem issues and whenever I meet an attractive and smart girl I get triggered. I get immensely angry and embittered and have thoughts like 'she is cruel and must have broken the hearts of dozens of decent guys' and 'she has more sex in two weeks than I have in an entire year and she laughs at me behind my back and thinks I am a pathetic child'. I immediately get the feeling that she pretends to be nice but actually looks down on and feels sorry for me. In fact, I view our entire society as one centered on an unspoken competition about the quantity and quality of sex you can get for yourself and those, who are single and lonely and obviously cannot fulfill their needs and desires are secretly ridiculed by people in relationships and by society as a whole. Basically I have the feeling that life is like high school continued with the cool people that can have as much sex as they want and the losers, who may only have some occassionally. And the top of the hierarchy are the pretty and intelligent women, who are like demigods.

My belief is that everything is about having as much sex and happiness with someone as possible and the game goes on until we get old and I have already missed out so much at 30 that I won't be able to make up for it, so by default I have to live my desires every day, or else I'll have lost the game already. Furthermore, I also have the belief that all highly attractive and intellectual women are egotistical and arrogant and they are essentially a different class of humans with access to any pleasure they want anytime.

I think the reason for this is twofold: for one, I was always small and weak for my age and I had a very toxic sister with mean friends who always reminded me of this. I was treated as a small kid wherever I went. Two: I have a peculiar desire/fetish since childhood that constitues the core of my personality and I have very specific fantasies on how to experience it, but I never can. It is more than just about the act of sex for me; it's about experiencing the most innate part of my personality, to reveal and embrace my deepest, true self and it's impossible for me to have this without a partner. 

 

Now I know that these are very unhealthy thoughts and that is why I am reaching out. I need help overriding these beliefs. I need advice on how to get out of this mindset. I know that these thoughts are not true but I have such tremendous amounts of frustration and I have experienced so many times that I was looked down on or someone else was chosen over me and that I am never good enough that my feelings automatically turn on these convictions and I become resentful and full of hatred.

I do attend therapy, but even there it's problematic; it is a therapy group where a gorgeous girl just joined and I already have lots of anxiety because these feelings pop up immediately. I want to seek advice and feedback on these thoughts, how I could neutralize them, how I could think of women and myself differently from men who have been past this or who have a healthy self-esteem. I want to become a happy and worthy father and husband. Please help me."	Expensive_Meet222	post	27.185704953446205	male	White	0.008036565966904163	na	na	na	13	malementalhealth
"Most of the stuff you said I agree with. Perhaps you’re consuming too much online content aimed to outrage. Best to be aware of that stuff, but with your experiences with your sister perhaps it’s only natural to feel that way. In general I think you should try not to derive your self worth from what others think of you. Most of them are stupid assholes anyways. 
And you can change your mind about people by interacting with them with an open mind and having better experiences. Everyone has biases, just try not to let them affect your actions."	Expensive_Meet222	reply	na	na	na	0.008036565966904163	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

It seems you're aware of the origin of this reaction, and I think you're on the nose. It definitely sounds reactionary / preventively putting up barriers based on the experience you went through. 

And that's understandable. Being bullied like that with no help from family when you needed it will leave long lasting scars and wounds on your psyche.

There is nothing you wrote that is wrong.  What you want is something basically every man wants but you've had a difficult time obtaining it.  I'm in a very similar position as you and I think what helps me is honestly helping people like you.  Because we share a similar struggle and our thoughts are much the same.  The one thing I've learned about people is that sometimes the best friend you need is you.  All the things you look for in another person are actually inside of you you just have to trust yourself and like who you are.  Like you can do so many things to take care of yourself and diminish this strong desire you have it's very difficult to explain but it involves a lot of very focused and disciplined self care.  Like you will make an effort every day to do something to relax your body to remove this constant tension.  You are actually adapting yourself to your unique situation where you are letting go of the past and centering yourself.  And as you do this you will start to want less and appreciate what you have.  You will see the world as this strange place that you exist in and because it is actually quite strange is the reason why it's difficult for you.  And it's not immediately because you are different or strange but just that people perceive you that way.  In another words it's not always just you doing something as much as it is people being different from you.  And that's not even your fault or meaning that you are a problem, you aren't.  What you are ultimately struggling with is your self image and finding compatibility.  You have also witnessed something that bent your mind the wrong way.  It's warped your mind to think all attractive women are going to be terrible.  Can I suggest one thing?  Can you maybe seek out an attractive person *who is friendly* and try to become their friend (not boyfriend, but just a friend)  Maybe what you can realize is underneath that beauty is a person and you can learn to appreciate their soul and spirit rather than how they look.  Try to seek out better looking people and be friendly to them.  Not everyone will be open to it but it's something you can try.  I have attractive women friends and it's changed how I see things.  Every single one of them is very different even though they are all attractive looking.  You will find the same thing is true as you explore.  Try to allow yourself to accept that some will be very cold and entitled and that's fine you will run into some that are absolutely stunning and just very sweet and friendly to you.  Those women will completely change how you feel about it.  You will realize the way they look is just a shell.

One major improvement can come from avoiding outrage content. Basically news, reddit, Twitter, commentary YouTube, anything where when you consume it you notice you sometimes get mad. Expose yourself to positive experiences and people more, like a church that builds it's members up (as opposed to the stereotypical reddit conception of church that's obsessed with thinking they're better than everyone else, like the westboro baptist church IIRC).

"Edit: OP I just want to point out that the people taking issue with this comment are also active in subs like foreveralone, foreveraloneafter30, and virgin. If that’s who you want advice from, that’s on you at that point. 

This sub is not going to be great for advice because there’s so many others in your position here and have toxic mindsets as well. 

The first thing you need to do is understand (truly understand) that you’re the problem. You. Nobody else. Not any kind of woman, nor any man. It is your mentality and behavior that pushes people away. This isn’t in a “you’re not good enough” way at all. This is in a “your toxic ideologies come across in your behavior and it scares people away” way. 

If you think any of this is hidden from others, you’d be sorely mistaken. It likely comes across in the things you say, how you act around certain people, your body language, your tone, and everything else. People can generally sense this kind of negativity. You probably don’t know you’re doing it which contributes to your frustration when people keep their distance. 

Why would there be some fatal flaw to you that makes you so much worse off than other men? There isn’t. It is simply how you carry yourself and behave. Women absolutely date fat men, ugly men, awkward men, men with acne, balding men, scrawny men, short men, and men with any other trait you would stereotypically think puts them at a disadvantage. Women are not some single-minded organism. Men who hold toxic ideas about women, men who do or say creepy things, and men who put on a fake persona are those that struggle. 

The absolute most important thing to any woman, and really to any person in general is that they feel safe around you. Whatever tangent you started on about a strong sexual fetish already makes me not feel safe with you even through a screen. You are sex obsessed, don’t see women as individuals, and see the world as revolving around you. Nobody is sitting there analyzing you or paying attention to you in the way that they are classing you in some hierarchy.

Life is not about sex. Thinking this way almost certainly guarantees that these ideas are bleeding into your behavior. Again, not making others feel safe. 

You need one on one therapy. Your group therapy is not enough. I think you also should keep going because you need exposure to women in a controlled environment. 

I’m not saying any of this to be mean to you at all. I’m just being blunt. I’m not sugar coating. 

It is great that you’re recognizing that this isn’t healthy. It’s great that you want to change. I really hope you do. Changing your situation will truly only come from within. There are no cheats. If you want to be a husband and father one day, you need to change the way you think and view the world. Everything else will follow. You cannot put the horse before the carriage. I’d suggest finding a male therapist to see one on one so you can get to the bottom of the real issue. 

9/10 times it is something a lot deeper than just something you’ve developed over time (how you were raised, your socialization through childhood, perhaps a disorder that might be affecting you, etc. ). 

I want to end this by saying you’re not hopeless. It isn’t too late, you’re not behind, and you aren’t a bad person. For whatever reason, something interrupted your social development. This can be addressed and you can fix it. But you have to want it. You have to take responsibility. Despite any past experiences, everything is in your hands now and it is on you to decide what direction your life takes."

"The number one lesson guys need to be taught is that in your late teens or early twenties, unless you meet a good woman - most of the women are chasing after the top 20 percent of the men. That those women are very insecure and deep down realise that they are in competition with one another for a finite resource that will likely cheat on them - so they then put down and belittle the non-runners in an attempt to manipulate them. The idea being that if they can't have Chad McChadface, well they'll beat you down enough so that you don't cheat on them when they decide you're good enough.

I say this as a happily married dude, who's been married since his early twenties because I found a good one and noped the fuck out of dealing with the crazies. I had one friend, beautiful, intelligent and a borderline - that suddenly wanted me in my thirties now I'm making more than the UK prime minister....despite the fact that she called me ""sexless"" when we were young, gay tested me by using a friend to try and touch me up and she acted as if I'd always be around to listen to her. You should have seen how bitter she got  in her 30s when she realised she'd pissed her twenties up the wall on fuckwits. Some of the weasely backhanded/underhanded shit she said to me like ""you're such a well rounded guy these days, when are you having kids?"" wound me up so much at the time...along the lines of ""damn right, bitch - you'd better not come running to me now"".

The good news is that dating gets hilariously easy for guys if you are halfway in shape and making money, once you're in your late twenties to early thirties. All the guys I know who were single a lot in their late teens and early twenties are having a riot breaking hearts left right and centre on hinge.

The Incels are stupid but the ""where have all the good men gone"" femcels are equally as hilarious. So don't beat yourself up too much, there are as many femcels as Incels. Fuck them all, fuck you sister, fuck god, fuck the universe and fuck Manchester United - go and make money, snort as much coke as you can, hit the gym and date around and don't listen to people who tell you you're a piece of shit. Maybe you are, but so is everyone. 

Once you realise that as a guy, you are intrinsically worthless - after the initial shock - you may suddenly conclude that you're free to do whatever the fuck you like regardless of social expectations. Life becomes a lot easier to succeed once you throw your moral compass in the toilet.

"I’ve gave up on chasing women, trying to get a girlfriend etc. Because it ended up feeling pointless, at times I could only laugh at how time and time again I failed. But then I realised “Why should I chase? Why not let it happen in its own due course? Why not just let it come to me in time?” 

I think we crave that feeling of love and affection from a girl due to lacking in other aspects in our lives. I’m working hard to love and improve myself first and foremost now, because if I love myself why would I need to chase someone else’s affection? The great thing is though, in that state of self love and self confidence is when it will start to happen, you will attract people as your positive vibe and aura increases. I found that when I was chasing love and affection from girls the most, was when I was at my lowest point in life, I was lonely anxious lost and hopeless. Trying to fill the void that was the love I should have had for myself, with that of a girl’s.

My life isn’t super hard compared to others but it’s hurting me a lot and im trying my hardest to get through it. I have many struggles one of them is money management growing up I didn’t have much now that I have a pretty decent job i blow my money and don’t save. I struggle with social anxiety. I don’t know what to talk about with people. U feel awkward when I do try to talk to people sometime I get nervous and talk really fast then mess up I get super embarrassed. I deal with low self esteem I don’t think that I’m that great I don’t think I’m good at the things I do I feel like I won’t be good enough for any women. I feel like I’m just some weirdo that no one wants to talk to. All my friends are off doing there own thing and just feel stuck	Frequent_Discussion4	post	17.66553768736852	male	White	0.9839734435081482	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth
"Hey bro, hang in there! 💪 
I can definitely relate to how you’re feeling, as can sooo many other young men out there so please remember that this is a valid challenge and you are not alone. I’ve struggled with my self esteem and social anxiety throughout life and often still do, as much as I have progressed in the last few years. You’ve already completed the first step towards improving, which is acknowledging the fact that you’re feeling this way and recognizing that you need to make a change. Good job bro 👏 

In my experience, the first step I took towards improving was to educate and learn about social anxiety and low self esteem. Understanding the root causes of these feelings that you’re having, and how they manifest in your life will really help you gain a better perspective and allow you to work on strategies to cope better. 
When you don’t understand why you have these feelings it’s so difficult to work on yourself and improve because you just feel lost, like any effort you might be putting in is just a stab in the dark. You need to do some research, and some thinking on What & Why you’re feeling this way. From there you can build and build momentum of self improvement, because you have direction now. 

Let me know if this helped 🫶🙏"	Frequent_Discussion4	reply	na	na	na	0.9839734435081482	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"I hate my shitty fucking therapist, I hate my family, I hate my few friends. No one has ever listened or cared about me. Even with very visible fucking illnesses that fucked up my life no fucking body in my family listened or got me help. In present day I have problems, tell them to people and all I get is shit. Minimizing, redirecting blame to me WHEN THEY HAVENT EVEN HEARD THE WHOLE FUCKING STORY. People are so biased against men it’s insane. I’ve never received any actual empathy in my life. This is what true loneliness is.

"What you feel is valid, but don't let it consume you. You might be in crisis right now. Do you have anyone you can reach out to if you feel unsafe? I understand the answer to that might be, ""No."" and that's a lot to deal with. It does cause you to resent other people. Especially, if you are suffering in silence.

Sometimes, I think boys, especially if they were given too much responsibility too young or had to be the ""man of the house"" or they were neglected, will naturally adapt over time to getting used to what you are describing. No empathy. No consideration. No validation. Everything that happens to us is our fault. Every time we have a problem, it doesn't take too long for other people to identify that WE ARE the problem. This causes men to try to be emotionally self-sufficient, and we don't bother anyone with our problems (not because WE are so stoic and manly, but because we are used to other people reacting negatively to us when we have a problem.) So we labor and we do the hard shit and we are told that if we do that long enough and we bear our yoke and carry our cross and don't complain, others will notice and we will be valued and respected... except it doesn't usually work like that. Us not complaining leads others to think we don't have problems. Or when we do, they blame us because they don't see the circumstances around it, because we didn't bring them up. And that can lead to resentment which can lead to hate. That is a valid emotion. Maybe none of this relates to you, but that's how I felt a lot of the time.

But do not let the hate consume you. For me I filled myself up with so much self-hatred that it began to spill over onto others. You lit a fire to warm your bones, but if you don't keep it under control it'll burn your house down. Recognize the hate and rage for what it is. It isn't you, it is something you are feeling. You are not hate and it will not possess you. It is a normal reaction to a problem in your life. The energy these activating emotions give you can be tamed, reformed and used to solve the problem or let loose and be allowed contribute to it.

When a horse breaks its leg the only option is to put it out of its misery. It’s common knowledge that due to the behaviour of a horse there’s no way to keep it sedated long enough for its leg to heal. Upon waking up from from a surgery it will become skittish and break its leg again. There’s nothing that can be done to help it. It’s more humane to take it out. Why can’t we apply the same logic to humans who clearly see they don’t have a chance in this life?	anon_ldn	post	23.581800500061917	male	White	0.9962310194969177	na	na	na	5	malementalhealth

"I see three things here: jealousy, pain of rejection and active humiliation. 

The rejection part is probably short term so you just have to focus on the next gal. It’s always painful to be rejected. A tip here for next time is that the pain of rejection is proportional to the effort you push into it. Meaning: if you hint at you are interested it won’t be painful to be rejected but if you compose a song and sing it outside her window and she rejects it’s painful. Next time be small in your gestures. 

The jealousy is harder because that probably did not start with this situation. I guess adding more positive stuff, distractions and good people, to your life you will be less jealous.

Did you learn this behavior towards your mother? Did she use you predominantly as emotional support? Robbing you of the chance to develop your own individual identity, wants and needs? Making you think that your constant supportive attention towards women is healthy and normal?

"The easy answer is just ""self love.""

Unfortunately, it's not an instant cure. You've spent your whole life up to this point learning to hate yourself in various ways for different reasons. Hating yourself becomes the only way to make sense of the world.

You have to practice self-love every single day to stop this miserable feeling.

The good news is that practicing self-love is incredibly easy and only takes mere minutes out of your day. Spending a couple of hours at the gym a couple of times a week is also a great form of self-love, but we can shelf that for now if you don't feel up to it.

The bad news is that you have to do it every single day, and it feels weird, unnatural, and even downright uncomfortable for a long time until you *literally* rewire your brain.

Some things I did, and still do include:

- ""Flirting"" with yourself in the mirror. Look in the mirror, try to give yourself a compliment or even a little ""pep talk""

- Writing daily gratitudes. Once a day I write three things I'm grateful for down on a piece of paper. I strongly suggest physically writing your gratitudes over merely typing them. I started small with things like, ""I'm grateful for the clean water that hydrates me. I'm grateful for the fresh air that fills my lungs. I'm grateful for having working legs and eyes."" No matter how small or insignificant it is, give thanks that you have it. It's okay to repeat things, but try to think of new things to be grateful every day.

- Writing one thing you like about yourself with your gratitudes. You can write more, but doing just one a day helped me a lot. Pro-tip: You can write things you want to like about yourself even if you don't feel like they're true about you. At my peak of self-hate, I truly believed I was unlovable in my heart, but I still wrote things like, ""I am a fun person to be around. I am a good friend. I have a great sense of humor.""

Trust me. It sounds stupid. You might even hate doing it for a while, but it gets easier as you go. After a while of consistently doing this, things start to change in weird ways.  You start to notice all of the vibrant colors in the world around you. Food tastes better, music sounds different, people smile around you more... Just buy a little notebook and write a little bit just once a day. It takes just a few minutes."	fiekdkckd	reply	na	na	na	0.9987799525260925	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

I also made GPT-4 into a mental health journaling mechanisms and journaled some of my feelings and thoughts as en enhanced journaling experience. I also asked how I could get involved in my local community and the service provided me very in depth ways to help me get involved in the community. Anyways, I imagine myself being able to ask AI a question that is related to my client and then helping my client utilize some of the suggestions openAI provides me, such as helping someone if they are homeless.

"AI is utterly unpredictable right now. People expect it to be intelligent in all the ways we would want a human to be intelligent, but even moreso. The truth is that we are still the ones designing it and if we are designing it in our own image (it would appear that we are to some extent), then we are in for a few rough surprises. ""If the human brain were so simple we could understand it, we would be so simple we couldn't.""

Yes, AI will be intelligent, but it will also be very stupid or even insane in unpredictable ways that we failed to account for. In the long-term there are essentially two ways General AI can go: 1) We make an abomination in our own image (with a few minor, but very relevant defects) that is all-powerful, all-knowing, all-present and controls our entire society, and will probably see us as little more than a liability, or 2) We create partners or guides who will shortly have very little use for us, but will keep us around in a utopia-like existence out of their own good graces.

I am so exhausted. There are people who can help me but they won't. The mental health system is nothing but a con job- but of course what is not a con job in the U.S.? I can't find anyone who seems to really know what it's like in my head and my spirit. I have nowhere to go. I wish I could end it easily and find intimacy with God. When I couldn't seen by others no matter how hard I tried I could at least create the world in my mind- sanctuary, refuge... these things are gone now. Everything is gone. And I only have breadcrumbs of any beauty. they can't just give me a roof and food with a little bit of extra spending money and call it a day. They can't just give a pretense of mental health therapy- but they can- and will!!! Goddamn them for doing this. Goddamn them for the neglect- neglecting me since childhood. They knew I was suffering! They knew!! What is wrong with me??? I hate all these stupid things I am left with to cope- to get some kind of immediate fix, distraction, distance from my mind- pornography is desensitized and abstracted sex that hasn't been resolved from intimacy- it's weak music- it's fast food for my emotions and soul. But they don't care! You are just an incel or misogynist! You are a pornographer! I'm shooting heroin in my veins and it's called porn. I'm doing this because I have been abandoned by the people who could have helped me- and I have been born into a world full of shit- status, money, looks- fierce overly sensitive political drama! well I don't care if you are black, white, male, female, trans, feminist, Red pill, blue pill, purple pill, Republican, Democrat, Trumpist, Bidenist- whatever the Hell. I'm not seen in this world and cannot live. Too much identity shit and looking at the other for their usefulness to see me in this world. I am blind blind. My head feels so strongly shut down I cannot see. I try to read words and don't know what they are. I don't know the words and they are so full of thorny confusion- and then they come together with other words and it just rushes over me and drowns me! It's all blank what people are saying here- and everywhere. I cannot see!!! Tomorrow the words I pulled teeth today to know what they are will disintegrate. You cannot talk to me because I cannot receive anybody's words anymore. I can only receive sleep and food. And then I can add porn to my life's experiences- I just want to escape. Can't anyone understand. I hate all the food, the internet, the entertainment, social media, the ass shaking for men. I actually just want my face to be caressed in a genuine way. I want to be held. Even if I need to change my gender- Just stop with me being the bad guy!! Just stop already!!! I can't take it anymore. I can't be held by another person in a genuine loving way, to cuddle, to fall asleep- and I don't feel entitled. No one should have to be with a monster like me- engulfed in the fog. Just please since I can't have intimacy with anyone- I can't mind meld or heart meld and my mind is like being trapped in a cave that has caved in and I only have my bleeding knuckles to complain--- please please what way is there to die peacefully and in the least amount of pain?

Did you know though that the healthy place to be is a balance point between these two ends?  

Over focus on emotions is called **rumination** and it is very bad for you. It does not help you solve your problems and it increases likelihood of developing various axis-1 mood disorders like depression and anxiety.   Women, who are biased towards focusing on their emotions and internal world are prone to rumination and research shows this is one of the biggest drivers of increased rates of depression in women.  

People who **distract** too much though also end up in a bad place.  Their problems are still there and they will come out sooner or later.  It often comes out as anger, even violence, and if people keep trying to avoid their problems it often results in substance abuse disorders (drugs are a very effective, albeit maladaptive, temporary escape).  Because men are biased to respond to emotions this way, this is a major reason why men are more likely to have substance abuse disorders or end up incarcerated.

Regardless of your gender, if you have a tendency to distract yourself from your problems, you need to connect with your emotions more and work to face your problems.  

If you can't stop thinking about your emotions and problems, however, you actually need to go in the other direction.  You need to spend less time focused on yourself and your emotions.  It is probably doing you a lot of harm.

So, are you are ruminator or are you a self-distractor?  

If you are interested, in another post I can share tools to handle both effectively so that you find and stay at the adaptive balance point."	ansonwhitmer	post	32.810904415166306	male	White	0.6678457856178284	na	na	na	6	malementalhealth

"To begin, I'm a very extroverted person and often find a lot of self-worth as being the friend, always available, help whenever needed, etc. I'm also very aware that when I develop romantic feelings for somebody, I just dive off the deep end in my own mind about it.

Recently I became interested in a new person at work, became friends joking around and what I thought was flirting, but turns out I was wrong. I realize if I continued to interact with her the same way, I would continue to become more attracted to her and end up being hurt more. So I have reduced almost all contact with her to just any other coworker, no joking around, no outside my job description favors, etc.

I think over the past 2 weeks she's noticed the shift and somewhat tries to interact as we did before.

"Exercising is extremely valuable for mental health. The gym is extremely valuable for routine and exercise works better than anti-depressants. But do NOT try to tie someone's worth to having a certain body shape or composition. This is extremely unhelpful. That body is not achievable for everyone.

I have been working out consistently since I was 11 years old. I'm 5'4"", I have never weighed more than 135 lbs, max 5% body fat I'll estimate, and at one time I weighed 125 and could bench 250. I was fit. Never got a compliment on it. Not once. Got compliments from other guys on my fitness, but never my body. Women still assumed I was weak, I was still the butt of all the ""weak guy"" jokes, every time I tried to help someone move, some one's girlfriend would designate herself as my baby sitter and everything I picked up she would coo, ""Oh, let one of the big boys get that for you."" So I picked up heavier and heavier shit and this has happened like half a dozen times, not once has the woman doing it ever taken the hint. Because no matter how strong I was, I was a short guy with a thin frame. Insufficient.

So what did I do? I got proud. Doubled down. I worked out more and more, pursuing a body that would be ""good enough."" Never took supplements, never juiced, just good diet and working out. Lifted HEAVY for my size. I've had three workout injuries in the past year (knee, back, groin), and now all that effort I put in for almost two decades is gone. And I'm not 30, and my knees and back are falling apart, because I tried to be ""good enough."" And it never made me feel good. Not for one minute. It was always just a giant insecurity, because I just didn't have the natural frame to have an attractive body. Be proud of your fitness or your effort, but don't listen to this crap, ""Having a great physique is essential to your self esteem.""

Morally, this is basically two steps above a diet company going to an eating disorder forum and trying to tell people they will be happy once they finally get that perfect body.

Side note: Idk if it's ironic that the last image is an image of Samson right before he realized his strength couldn't help him out of the situation his pride had put him in and he killed himself and his Philistine captors as his final repentant act... but there's a lesson there that is being missed."

"Unplug from the internet entirely. Total social media detox.
No dating apps. No Facebook or Instagram. **ESPECIALLY NO TIKTOK**

Find a hobby that is both constructive and a creative outlet. Playing video games is fun way to kill time, but it mostly is a distraction. You need to find something that allows you to create something from your own imagination. It doesn't matter if you absolutely suck at it. 

I picked up whittling because knives are cheap and materials are also cheap and widely available. I suck fucking ass and my best sculptures merely vaguely resemble animals, but I still find the sound of a knife slicing through a block of wood to be the most soothing thing.

Lastly, take yourself out on dates. I'm 100% serious. Go to restaurants alone, go see movies by yourself and kick your feet up on the chairs in front of you (as long as there are enough seats for everyone). Take up space in public and have people walk around you. Become the main character of your own story. Go to places that interest you and make you happy. The only important thing is that you keep finding reasons to go outside.

If people ask you what you're doing, be open and honest about everything.

There is ZERO tolerance or patience for inexperienced people. Whenever I think about whether I have a chance or whether people are more open than I think, I’m instantly reminded whenever I see a sex/dating related post, meme or sub what people truly think of me

Sex is literally everywhere and literally everything comes back to sex. People all around will endlessly talk in detail about how much sex they have and how they do not tolerate anyone who doesn’t. Everyone is always making blatant and subtle sex jokes and comments in casual conversation. So many people are obsessed with sex and base a good amount of people’s worth around how much they get and how good they are at it. Virginity is almost always the first thing that gets insulted (“no bitches”, “what zero pussy does to a mf”, “get laid” “you’ll never feel the touch of a woman”) Even the most sex/body positive people around will bring up the v-card insults the moment they get the chance. If you are sexually inexperienced at an older age it’s basically fucking over. At 22 it is 100% abnormal for me to not have had sex yet when the overwhelming majority of people my age and slightly younger have done it. I’m SUPPOSED to have gotten laid by now, I’m SUPPOSED to have a huge body count by now, I’m SUPPOSED to be getting it regularly. Societal standards on sex aren’t  negotiable or arguable they are unshakable written in stone standards that everyone is expected to abide by and that most people agree with. If you aren’t fucking regularly and aren’t fucking like an absolute stallion, you’re not a real man and you’re a loser. Virginity is one of the absolute worst turnoffs for anyone and a massive red flag for anyone. Who tf wants to waste their time with a virgin? Who wants to instruct a sloppy weirdo who doesn’t know what to do? If you are not fucking like a rabbit in your prime you do not have any legs to stand on later in life. No one with even the slightest hint of self respect or standards would ever date a virgin. Most people will 100% abandon you in a heartbeat for someone who is more experienced and interesting. I had my chances with losing it naturally in high school or if I went to college, but now those are gone and now I’m left out to dry. Virginity is a fucking mental and physical scarlet letter,  it is one of the most repulsive and repugnant things to normal people that you can be and it only gets bigger and worse the older you get. I’m literally going insane right now and I can’t handle it. I can’t stop myself or control my thoughts or emotions and it’s hurting me."

" Desirability is a very fluid thing from person to person. Men often think they're not attractive, because they're not 6' whatever"" or they're not absolutely jacked, or whatever reason. But the reality is that women like a wide variety of different types of men. Sure, some women might like that aforementioned ""ideal"" body type, but, just as some men like taller women and others like shorter women, not everyone likes that ""ideal"" male body type. I think it mainly boils down to confidence, and knowing yourself. No matter what you look like, if you're not confident in your body or abilities, people will pick up on that. And similarly, if you try to force yourself to fit into one box or another, you'll end up ignoring and suppressing the parts of yourself that don't fit into that box. And the autism? Don't worry about it. There are plenty of women who *love* to listen to their special other ramble about whatever they're hyperfocusing on, and there will be people who are able to more effectively listen to what you need. That said, you have to be able to communicate that to a partner. If you have trouble picking up on social cues, explain that up front. If you're getting overstimulated or otherwise overwhelmed, explain that to your partner, or explain that you may need some space for the time being. Communication is the foundation of a good relationship, and if your partner doesn't accept the fact that you're autistic, or isn't willing to be understanding about what that might entail, that's a massive red flag. 

Another thing that I might mention, is that ""getting a girl"" isn't the end-all be-all goal that many people make it out to be. Its entirely possible to have a fulfilling life without having a romantic or sexual partner, and it's okay if you haven't, or never, have one. And there's no one point in your life where you are ""supposed to"" have sex, or a girlfriend, by -- it's okay to go at your own pace, and not be worried about how you compare to other people."	mycatischillest	reply	na	na	na	0.9978829026222229	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
Others have already expressed how you must not focus on aspects that you cannot change. I want to add that you can do lot of the things that other guys ignore that can make you stand out of the crowd. Like having the right hair cut that fits you, having the right clothing style that fits you, doesn't need to be designer clothes, you can watch some youtube videos and get some decent stuff from second hand. Girls put in a lot of work to craft their look when they go out hunting. Most men just put in the minimum effort and hope that girls will somehow take notice. Also, you shouldn't put too much meaning into this, in the end it is personality fit that matters most in long term. But while you explore what fits you, what matters to you and so on, you might want to do your homework to get a better chance. This is not intended to dismiss the hardships you have to go through due to bad luck in inherited traits, but this should also not discourage you from taking care of things that you can change.	mycatischillest	reply	na	na	na	0.9978829026222229	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

Like when I draw badly, I still enjoy myself as much as someone who draws well. The only difference is I’m never going to top the NYT bestseller list, but I still love the act of creating.

"The height thing is a cultural issue that's quite toxic, but that's ***not on you*** and you better remember that every time you feel bad for it.

On the other hand, I think it'd help you to look for things you can practice/learn in terms of confidence. Confidence is something of a mysterious ""fake it till you make it"" skill that's always bothered me a bit. I have a weird trajectory in that regard (I'm not a man, though I tried living like one), but I started singing lessons and practised public speaking in contexts where failure wasn't a big deal since there were no stakes. I also tried fixing my posture and having a more commanding voice (not loud) in my normal interactions. Trust me, these things help *a lot*.

>I don't even know how much I'm attracted to girls or if I even am

I’m 23 soon to be 24 years old , I just graduated college in December , and life feels shitty right now. I have to pay back my student debt , I have to pay back 400 something dollars to my college apartment just because I left and graduated. I’m living at home working at a place I feel like I shouldn’t even be at just, but hit helps brings in  money . I feel like the major I chose isn’t really working out . It’s not enough jobs for the things I want to do, but when I see a position that is for me I hesitate cause I feel like I’m not built for it. But don’t get me wrong I’ve gotten a couple jobs for film but I still feel like a failure. I really want to kill my self but the only thing that’s stopping me is family , religion, & debt. I feel like I’m just getting started with life but at the same time it’s already difficult. I just want to go back to being a kid , life was okay but it’s better than life now 💯💯.

"75% of therapists are females.  Most clients are females.  Most mental health researchers are female.  Mental health is essentially built for women by women.  There is a claim that one-size-fits all but research shows that, while there is definitely overlap, this isn't true.  Here are 8 ways men, on average, approach mental health differently

* Humor is helpful even for serious things vs feels like going to a monastery (or the dryness of a clinician's office)
* Our priority is solving specific problems distressing us (I have no job -> help getting a job) vs the priority is to share feelings (how do you feel about not having a job?) \*\*note- if depression is holding you back from getting a job, then you need to treat that not just the lack of a job\*\*
* Paternal (you have more in you but you need to get off the couch) vs maternal (you are perfect just as you are, baby)
* Want a concrete plan and push to action vs potentially never-ending reflection
* Want to feel more capable and in control vs a victim
* Want to learn and use specific mental tools (e.g., how to control rising anger quickly) vs only insight
* resonate with mental toughness vs vulnerability (\*getting help is an extremely valuable tool\*.  that said, we many of us resonate first with developing mental toughness - resilience, grit, & performance under pressure)
* masculinity is a good thing and we should built off it vs masculinity is toxic

\*\*note 1- this post is guided by a lot of scientific findings.  I can share links to research papers with you, if thats your thing.

note 2 - these points are about AVERAGES - as assessed by researchers - so you personally may disagree and that is to be expected. these are not hard and fast rules (men must like X and women Y).  so if you are a man, you may not want the above and if you are a women, you may want the above.

note 3 -  even men who resonate with the above points, at different times may need things that stray from the above points.  Have serious childhood trauma that is holding you back? you probably need to explore it in an open ended way to resolve it.

note 4 - women and men can both provide this type of help for mental health or not provide it.  It depends on training and goals of the therapist.  Men clearly can resonate with other men about male issues but woman can learn this too and can be A+ at helping men with male-specific issues.

I think these ones in particular are less about sex and more about what the actual problem is. If you just have mild depression and just need a CBT tune up yeah this approach will do great. If you have childhood trauma from abuse or neglect, then ""stop whining and get off the couch"" doesn't work because it mirrors the treatment that got that person to where they are in the first place.

I’m really glad that you are coming to us for help instead of some other awful alternative. Yeah, life is hard for sure. I’m in my 40’s and feel like this, also. A lot of it is because I made poor choices when I was younger (especially financially). Hopefully you are still young.  If I had a young son like you, I would tell him to set clear fitness and financial goals. Then, stay the course no matter what - 2 months isn’t long enough to notice change - give yourself a year at least. Don’t give up, live one day at a time, and also accept that you WILL be dead someday (truth for all of us). The sooner that kicks in, the sooner you will act with urgency when working towards your goals. Next set milestone timelines (example at this age, I want this much saved up and after a year of going to the gym I want to be at this much fat percentage). Give up some video game time a day (like 10 minutes) to watch a you tube video about financial literacy. Some folks I recommend are Dave Ramsey, Bob Sharpe, and Minority Mindset. Build up a dividend portfolio using a brokerage app (Webull, Robinhood, MooMoo) - so far Webull seems to be the easiest to use. If you’re disciplined and consistent with investing, you can be bringing in 1500 a month in dividends after 10 years. It seems like your family loves you - that’s something! I have my parents and my sister - while it would be nice to have a wife and kids, at least I have them as an anchor. I’m playing catch up in my 40’s and haven’t given up - what else am I going to do with my life - lol.

You are getting medicine, you keep on going to the gym, so you are on a right path to getting somewhere. Consider getting some protein powder to drink after gym, to recover your muscle and build your strength quicker. Don't worry about the max weight you are lifting at this point, most important is to be persistent, develop a habbit ang get to the point when you will start seeing some results. It ain't much but it will help your confidence. With medical condition you are at disadvantage, so don't beat yourself up for not catching up with everyone else. Decent people would understand and encourage your effort to improve yourself. Finding friends is not easy and is not under your control, so give some time for that, try to pick some social activity which will suit you and try just to learn to be comfortable around people little by little. When you are depressed it is not advisable to set yourself some major goals and expectations, it can drag you even more down if you feel you are not living up to it. Looks like playing pc games is not giving you any joy at this point, I suggest trying some different activity, just to catch a break and rewire your receptors a little.

It fucking sucks dude Ive lived it for a long time kind of surprised I'm alive and not in prison. My life was rough for years continuously. I think I probably got lucky, I feel like that happens a lot. 

Adventure, explore, on your own, with others, that always feels good to me. Family issues can be difficult. I don't interact with my father for instance. Reason being, he will not add value to or enrich my life and I am not in a position where I can lose the mental, emotional, time investment/energy. Definitely a history between us that contributes to it. Talking about this in therapy has helped me a lot. You'd be amazed how weird/dysfunctional your family's behaviors are compared to what's healthy.

It'll take a while, and it'll be awkward and you'll feel like a fool for a while, but I really started noticing 2-3 months after I started my life started to feel better. A lot better. It did get worse mentally/emotionally just before. But it was worth it. It helped a lot that I had a goal. Kind of a continuous goal instead of a one and done event kind of goal. 

I know ill continue to improve and that feels fucking good. You can totally do this."	dandy_dandy_dandy	reply	na	na	na	0.9991902709007263	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"Seek a therapist that is proactive in helping you move forward.

To get an idea of what it’s like. See “therapy in a nutshell”. Find one like her in real life. Honestly really helps you move forward little by little in life and to spot any negative thought spirals that’s untrue about yourself. Healthygamergg is another great YouTube channel too. Life is definitely not easy and people are more isolated than ever. You’re not alone in that regard. It’s hard on a lot of people and Depression is on a steep rise. 

You can build yourself little by little with hobbies that helps you socialize and as well as having productive habits that disciplines your brain and body to be more driven in life to make change. Excercise is a big one.

Much love and peace to you. Please keep trying."	dandy_dandy_dandy	reply	na	na	na	0.9991902709007263	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"**TL;DR: I (30M) have been for over a year with my 31F girlfriend. Many things happened in the relationship which made me progressively anxious and doubting the relationship. Now I am about to breakup but still feel sad and guilty.**

Hello men of Reddit! 

This post is going to be long but to be honest this is because I am going through a rough time, feel very guilty about breaking up and I know I will have no support system afterwards. This post is going to be long but to be honest this is because I am going through a rough time, feel very guilty about breaking up and I know I will have no support system afterwards. I am seeing a therapist but just started an only have 2 sessions a month.

I (30M) have been for over a year with my 31F girlfriend. After having broken up several times and tried to come back to make it work, I still felt something was broken inside me, at a point when I know I have to breakup because the relationship is toxic but I am so sad because we had good moments and I still have feelings for her.

This post is for every male having difficulty to spot red flags in particular with misandry, because it was my case as I experienced it for the first time. Also, I am posting this because I think I know inside of me that I should breakup but I am being sensitive, sad and feeling guilty of leaving her.

Positive aspects of the relationship to be mentioned, and that are the reason why I am so sad at the idea of leaving her and why I am not feeling strong:
- we had an awesome connection, we would laugh a lot together
- We have activities we like to do in common and in those moments it felt all our disagreements went away
- I have of course feelings and I am still attracted to her

Trying to sum up the elements that happened and that affected me: 
- after 1 month and a half relationship, seeing each other several times a week, sleeping together, going on a trip together, she mentions she wants an open relationship. I said I could not have it this way and that I it created anxiety with me and that I could not build a relationship this way. I respect the people who do but this is not a helpful thing for my mental health. She was not being understanding and tried to force me into an open relationship by playing with words and putting the blame on me: saying I am possessive, that if I had feelings I should have trust in her, and that we did not know each other anyway. I really never understood why she did not mention this at the 3rd-ish date before building connection and trust with me first, to at least give me the option. So, seeing she would not let this go, I had to break up. 
- Then, after a month, she asked me if I wanted to come back if she would reconsider, to which I said yes, so we were in a closed relationship. 
- Over the remaining time, I discover she was actually a misandrist when she would talk badly of men for no reason: laughing at me and saying I am mansplaining when my intention never was to be condescending with her, saying “being a white male must be why you are not a feminist”, saying I should take her side everytime a man talks badly to her because in her mind “this is always because of misogony”. No girlfriend had told me that in the past, ever. She would beging sentences like “condescending men are systemic”, “male perverts are everywhere” to which I felt either I should abstain from answering or (which I did not do) should agree with her. As I did not agree she used to say I was sexist.
- She insisted several times (and I never accepted because did not feel like it) on pegging me. At random times, she would get on top of me from behind, saying “it would be great if I could f*** you with a strapon. You sure you would not like it?” For like the 10th time. Even if it was in intimacy moment I felt degraded because I had said I did not want this nor was attracted to this. I believe like every other sexual activity, if there is consensual agreement, fine sure.
- Once she exploded because I told her we could reconsider our weekly plan to go dancing at our class because we were 40 minutes late, I nicely offered to go to the restaurant instead to have a moment together, to which she answered I will go alone and you do not have to give orders to me. It was never my intention. This hurt me a lot because she decided to go in an egoistic way and then assume I was giving her orders. When I ask why is she so biased, she answers it is because her ex, her father talked to her this way and that all men in society think they can talk badly to women. I did not appreciate to be put in the same basket and to be compared to an ex for absolutely no reason.
- When, because of all that, I refused temporarily to move in with her because I thought I needed time, she told me I was being a coward and that I was being childish. I felt my boundaries were not being respected.
- When I recently broke up (those who read might remember another post by me) she would literally send me dozens of messages, call me 20 times and say “I am in front of your building”. I felt scared.
- She also “blamed” me for identifying myself as a male. Sometimes I would say things like: “where is the man side” at a clothe store and she would say “why directly the man side? Maybe you could find something you like in the girl side - just because blue is for men and pink for women no? Ahah” but then things like “I think I would like it if you wore a dress”. I absolutely respect anyone doing so but it is not my style so I said no, to which she answered that I am kind of rigid. 

Minor aspects but that had their importance over time:
- during our conversations, she would very often talk about others, and oftentimes to criticize. I felt kind of a negative mood floating around.
- She sometimes blamed me for her emotional state, such as asking me to go at her place on a sunday night just because she was feeling anxiety (other days were ok), and I sometimes went of course, but I could not do it everytime, to which she answered that she was deceived because I could not go there when she needed.

Because of all that, I freeze next to her. I have stomach ache, sleep issues, muscle shivering, I am really anxious. I cannot get tactile anymore. 

So I told her I needed time to disconnect but I will have to break up. I know that because ultimately I am not imagining a future with her because of all that. But it hurts. So sorry it was long but I have almost no one to whom I can talk about this."	hellocafe	post	21.98224668492874	female	White	0.9964810609817505	na	na	na	13	malementalhealth

"A couple of things... She may have been a misandrist, but there is something much deeper at work here than merely her beliefs about men. She ignored your boundaries, tried to guilt-trip you into ignoring your boundaries, and then guilt-tripped you for saying ""No"". 

First, she sounds like she has some deeeeep insecurities and is using progressive language to turn it around and guilt-trip and manipulate. 

My ex would try shit like this, and the best things I did to counter it was learn conflict resolution skills, deescalation techniques, and... I can not recommend this channel enough... watching Doctor Ramani videos on how to deal with narcissists. Her channel breaks down the different kinds of narcissists, how to identify signs of narcissism, how each one operates, and what you can do to enforce boundaries against them (which I must warn you will make them very upset at you and show their true colors). She also goes into different kinds of emotional manipulation techniques people like her use and gives you tools on how to counter them.

Second, you should talk to your therapist and seek resources on codependency. (I'm willing to place money that a majority of men on here are codependent to some degree.) I personally recommend Codependent No More by Melody Beattie, and I'm sure your therapist would too.

Going back to unhealthy relationships because there were ""good moments"" and your strong hesitation to leave this obviously abusive relationship are signs that you are codependent. This is crucially important because codependent people will usually either find themselves entering another unhealthy relationship or end up sabotaging it themselves."	hellocafe	reply	na	na	na	0.9964810609817505	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"Please run, this an abusive relationship.

Do you have any friends you can talk with about that? (If not, did you had any friends before meeting her? And then slowly you ""lost"" your friends or was not allowed to see them anymore? Because that would be another tail tail sign she is manipulative and abusive on you) Can you talk to your parents about that? 
I know it will probably feels hard but you need to talk about what she makes you go through to as many trusted people as you can, so that: 1. You can find people willing to support you when you break up

I have suffered so much. Indescribable suffering. But I found and accepted Jesus Christ into my heart, and now I feel ok. It's like a weight of 1000 tons off my shoulders. I finally don't feel angry or desperate anymore. I feel at peace. And I know what I need to do now. 

I need to tell everyone! Jesus is with you always at your side, even when you're not even aware of it. 

When Jesus is with you, you're NEVER alone! So don't despair. Even when you feel like you aren't loved. Even when you're going through the crippling pain of isolation, God is always with you.

I would encourage you that even when you don't feel as great as you do now, you are still completely known, loved, accepted, and forgiven by God.  Take the time to get connected with a local body of believers whom you can share life and support with.  This is good for your mental and emotional health, as well as your spiritual health.  If you are in therapy or on medication, continue in that as well.  Jesus loves you but He also wants you to use all means available to you to stay healthy.

This has been my overwhelming experience since 18. No one noticed I was suffering before then, and if they did they didn’t care or did nothing. When my mental health got bad enough that others had to notice, I received nothing but scorn. I’ve received nothing but scorn. My few male “friends” give me nothing but shit whenever I express feeling down or tell them what bothers me. Authority figures that were supposed to help me have given me nothing but shit. My own family. The best faith response you get is tepid sympathy laced with a tendency to victim blame. Yeah, there’s nothing to do but commit suicide. I give life my all but effort only goes so far when you lack basic human needs of people giving a fuck about you. I’ll fail some more inevitably and commit suicide when I’m destitute or my mom dies or something. As intended. No one gives a fuck when you’re a man.		post	27.707848095800998	female	White	0.9992716908454895	na	na	na	9	malementalhealth
"This is true to a large extent. Nobody is coming to save you, and until you accept that it’s going to be a hell of a journey.

With that in mind, your “friends” don’t really sound like friends, at least not yet.

My group consists of me and my two closest friends who actively support each other. The reason we are so close is because we understand each other’s “shadows”.

We know the darkest things about each other, that would be considered taboo by most. 

When you know truly know someone’s vices, wrongdoings and motivations, it gives a raw point of view in which there’s nothing you can say or do to one another that will come of surprise.

If you can find one or two friends to develop that kind of connection with, you’ll have the support & empathy necessary to help stay afloat — or at least that’s been my experience

We can spend all day arguing about the hardships different people experience based on what makes them different. What's more important is recognizing everyone has hardships no matter their background, and the universal human condition is suffering.

Yes, there are shitty selfish people who only care about what they can get from you.

There is also the possibility you haven't cultivated a healthy friend group.

It's also entirely possible you're viewing reality through a distorted lens.

All I know is that what you're saying is absolutely not true, and there are ways to create a better life for yourself and find happiness. I used to feel isolated and miserable until I started addressing certain childhood traumas and challenging certain beliefs I held about the world. It took years of introspection, shadow work, and being honest with myself, but I improved my life and surrounded myself with supportive and loving friends. 

The notion that the world is intrinsically against men is false. It's just a coping mechanism for when we can't figure out why we are hurting so much. Chances are you just have a lot of unresolved trauma."		reply	na	na	na	0.9992716908454895	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"Well my feeling is that I am horny. So horny that it makes me sad and depressed and angry.

I think horniness for a significant amount of men is the core source of their sadness, depression, and anger. But I feel like it is taboo to speak on.

Yes, for many men it is the lack of a relationship that effects their mental health. But for me (and others) it is the constant horniness and sexlessness. Just that itself. But I feel that we can’t talk about this.

Can we? This is the source of my pain. Will anyone believe me? Or will I be told “no, this is what you really want…”

Or there be a lack of empathy and sympathy towards my feelings of horniness. People say “seek therapy” (mainly said in a backhanded way but some do say it innocently) but would a therapist even care? Or would they be laughing at me on the inside, invalidate the issue, and trying to change the subject and minimizing it’s important to me.

I don’t want to be horny. I didn’t choose to care about sex more than conversations and romance and socializing. It’s just the way I am. But I think people will instead tell me to stop caring about sex so much. As if I didn’t already wish I could stop thinking and caring about it.

I’m not saying I’m entitled to sex. I’m not saying life isn’t unfair and that others don’t have significantly more difficult problems.

What I wish for is society to not make me feel like the number one thing my brain nags me about is something I should lie about. I’m tired of feeling that when they say I should open up about my feelings they want me to instead lie and open up about feelings that are acceptable to THEM to talk about. It defeats the purpose of encouraging people to open up in the first place, makes us bitter, and has us doing the opposite: closing up."	wiz-weird	post	17.68902869120294	male	White	0.9953800439834595	na	na	na	3	malementalhealth
 hey there, i just want you to know that i believe you and i hear you. it's completely understandable to feel sad, depressed, and angry when you're constantly feeling horny and sexless. it's frustrating to feel like you can't talk about it or that society doesn't want to hear it. you're not alone in this, and i hope you find a space where you feel comfortable to express your feelings without fear of judgment. seeking therapy can be helpful, but it's important to find a therapist who will listen and validate your experiences. remember, it's okay to feel the way you do, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires. keep reaching out and speaking up, and don't let anyone make you feel like your feelings aren't important.	wiz-weird	reply	na	na	na	0.9953800439834595	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
I know how you feel. I was engaged to be married to a very sexy girl. When we had sex, it was easily the best I’d ever had. Then she broke off the engagement in late 2019 and I haven’t had sex since then. (The pandemic didn’t help in that department, but that wasn’t my fault.) I’ve been working a lot on my self confidence, exercising more, and dressing better to help give me an edge with girls, but so far nothing. It’s very disheartening because you want to have a chance to meet a girl while you’re still considered to be physically appealing, when they’re not already attached, and when you can hopefully still have a degree of sexual variety. I get frustrated when women won’t give me a chance and when I feel like time is running out. So I’m in the same boat and I know how disheartening it can be because you do want to have sex after having not had it in years and when you can still get some.	wiz-weird	reply	na	na	na	0.9953800439834595	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

It's like you want to see the more wholesome part of life without it affecting you, at least in my experience anyway. Much of my life has been damaged by how I saw love and sex with my perception heavily damaged at a young age with me seeing things I wasn't supposed to see. I understand a lot about what you're trying to say, and I appreciate that you feel comfortable to talk about yourself openly here. Your feelings are absolutely valid regardless of what what anyone thinks. A lot of society is already badly skewed by this industrialized idea of sex and just how dehumanizing it is. A lot of people *are* incels in the world who think they deserve it but you make it clear that you're not and you deserve happiness. Its hard to find happiness because there's a shit ton of people telling you a specific way to live your life like it was a perfect blueprint and if you object then you're the bad one.

"Being both scared and tired
Not knowing how to feel

Trying to understand why
But not understanding feelings
Not knowing how with of which to deal

Experiencing a different kind of pain
That can be felt in your stomach and  bones

Feeling so incredibly lonely 
But hating being alone

Your mind turns against your body
Making you question everything you do

You chest hurts and your heart is heavy 
But you have to put on a brave face
There’s a whole day ahead you have to make it through 

You feel behind, like you’re never going to catch up
You constant have to tell your brain to be quiet and shut up

The smallest things feel the biggest to you
They become mountains that feel they cannot be moved

There is so much more that could be said
About what goes on in my head 

I can’t say much because if I do
You’ll say to yourself “no, that can’t be true.”

I wish it weren’t but unfortunately 
This is what goes on 
Inside of me 

I wish I could say
how much I want to be

This is so hard to read because I feel your pain I could literally cry with you because I know what you mean.  Focus on doing small things every day to feel better and move your mind to a healthier place.  It's the only way, you have to immerse in something and focus.  You can do this you are life you are present, you are in the moment.  You are a miracle of life just like everyone else in the world do not be fooled or betrayed by your thoughts or the opinions of others.  Do not compare yourself to other people, never do this.  You have a different set of circumstances driving your life, you can make peace with that I know you can because I have.  You can improve you can become the person you want. Baby steps every day you can do this.  You will never be alone you will be your own best friend in life.  Love yourself and you will never be lonely. Nobody can take that away from you.

Online dating is just a way to make me suicidal.

Been trying to go to meetups but literally all the women are either taken or simply not interested.

been doing everything to looksmax and gymmax and I just can't do it anymore. I can't even go to the meetups anymore cos I know things just never work out for me with women and then i end up even more suicidal.

"Looking through your post history, I see you've recently posted these questions on other subs:

>Can you worship ma durga if you hate women?

>The best move on the chess board for men against a system that wants to keep you down

It sounds to me like you're looking at this the wrong way.

First of all, get off the dating apps. Regardless of which app or site you use, online dating is a toxic pit that brings out the worst in both men and women. Don't get sucked in.

Second, you talk about working on your appearance by going to the gym, dressing up, etc. Getting in shape is good... but being physically attractive is not the best way to attract women. Not even close. In most cases, women are looking for men who understand and respect them, who they can have fun with and feel vulnerable with, while at the same time feeling safe and protected.

In other words, you need to work on your personality first. You need to work on understanding women - which is really just understanding people.

And that really starts with not hating women, or thinking that you're part of a system that keeps men down. Because you're not. 

Instead of going to online-based meetup groups specifically to meet women, I think first you should invest some time in interesting hobbies and activities that you sincerely enjoy, and then focus on meeting men and women that share those interests. This will make you more interesting and well-rounded, so that when you do go out to places specifically to meet women - bars, dance clubs, art house openings, etc - you'll have a social and emotional foundation to build a relationship on."

I'm a graduate in the field of IT have small amount of experience working at an intership where I barely learned anything. (I don't have significant enough knowledge to impress an employer).

I'm slowly loosing my mind working in my dead-end retail job I do not know how much more I can take. I'm still applying for jobs but I'm feeling more and more drained and it feels like my career life is going down the drain. 

Now my love life or more like non-existant. I forgot to add I'm 26 year old kissless virgin male who has never even been in a relationship. I can talk to women platonically but I'm terribly socially awkward when I need to carry conversation. I also cannot flirt very well and read social cues properly maybe women can sense that and are put off i don't know. I even have dreams of being with a women and when I wake up I feel like shit.  

I just feel very romantically lonely and it's hard to continue moving forward in life when I never even had most common human experience which is experienced being loved.  

My family side. I'm stuck with very emotionally abusive mom. She is infuriated with me that I cannot get a career job. She wants me to 24/7 be applying for jobs, or doing something that will lead me to job. I understand I need to step and I'm the only child but I feel like I cannot even breath.

"I just got discharged from a partial hospitalization program for learning coping skills and mechanisms for suicidal/self-destructive thoughts and behaviors. There were around 9 or 10 other people in that group, and literally every single one of them was in a relationship, had children, or was married. It made me feel so totally isolated, alone, and uncomfortable. These other people in the group were no shining butterflies either, they all struggled with severe depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and other issues that were severely impacting their lives, and yet they still managed to find even the smallest amount of social success. It made me realize that there is something so fundamentally wrong with me and that I fucked up in life so badly that I can’t even do one of the most basic and important parts of being human that 90% of people can do. It is absolutely abnormal and concerning to be my age and not had a social life for literal years along with not having a single romantic relationship in my entire life. I’m truly an outlier and an abnormal freak in a world where the overwhelming majority of superior normal people find relationships.

I’m 22 now. I’m SUPPOSED to have had a relationship by now. I’m SUPPOSED to have had sex at least once by now. I’m SUPPOSED to have an active social life by now. I’m SUPPOSED to have had socially acceptable talents and hobbies by now. I’m SUPPOSED to be living on my own by now. I’m SUPPOSED to have my whole life figured out and college degree by now. All the stuff the average person achieves naturally are things that are expected of me to have achieved them to be ever slightly worthy of love and respect. These societal standards aren’t negotiable or arguable, they are stone cold law that everyone is expected to follow. The fact that I haven’t had sex yet and am autistic already turns off the majority of people. Virginity and autism aren’t desirable or liked at all, they’re massive red flags to most people who would 100% prefer someone who is experienced and normal like them. It’s seriously disheartening how judgemental and vindictive most people are and how much people care about what others are doing in bed and how literally every single thing in the world today comes back to sex. If you don’t have a high body count and aren’t fucking like an absolute stallion, you are worthless to them. Most normal and well-adjusted people who have built their lives up naturally for years will ALWAYS have an advantage over me and be infinitely more desirable in the dating world, and the vast majority of people will 100% discard and abandon their potential partners for someone who is more attractive, experienced and desirables. I will never manage to compete on even the most basic level that normal people operate on, I will be spending the rest of my life playing catch up and desperately trying to convince everyone that I’m not a worthless loser and that my ugly looks aren’t representative of me so that I can be allowed to minority experience something that most people do when they are 18. It’s a never ending uphill struggle that I simply cannot win, I’m a lesser class of person who should be lucky that normal people even tolerate to be around. My life is over, it is as simple as that."	Western_Quantity_103	post	21.525233342176076	female	White	0.9955344200134277	na	na	na	2	malementalhealth
It isn’t at all comforting knowing that the only chance I’ll ever have is to spend years forging myself into a totally perfect and stable person to even be slightly worthy of something that most people do when they are teenagers. Not having a relationship by now already turns off 90% of people. Those people who have naturally experienced relationships and built up their lives will ALWAYS be superior to me and infinitely more desirable in the dating world. No matter how much work I put in or how long I stay on the grind to get to the baseline, someone younger and more attractive than me will have surpassed that and swept up any potential friend or partner from me. Nobody is looking for someone who’s lacking or short of perfection, they want someone who meets all of their preferences and is successful 24/7 and has their entire lifetime of experience and stories to call upon. Most people will 100% abandon and discard you for someone who is more attractive, successful, talented, better in bed, and more experienced. I don’t deserve in the absolute slightest to have success or to be loved, 16 year old Nathan who’s out on a date with the cute girl in his math class today does. At this rate, I’m going to throw away my entire life and wait until my poor health catches up to me and kills me. I’m not worth it and my life isn’t worth it.

I've got some good news for you, everything you listed is completely within your control and can be easily changed/achieved, especially now that there seems to be a fire under your butt to do it. Channel that drive.

All of those things are achievable if you do them in the right order. Focus on one and then the other.

1. Start with the career aspect first. Figure out something that has good work-life balance, low stress, and high pay. Get your degree in that (if you need one). If it's a field that you can be promoted into, get an entry level job in that field and the company will likely pay for any educational aspect. anything else is a waste of time. There, free college! 

2. This will lead to a good and impressive job.

3. Guess what, you can afford a nice place now!

4.  Constant recurring interactions with coworkers will lead you to easily make friends, now you have a Social Circle.

5. Relationships come last. Only do this once you've got shit figured out.

Things seem easier once you separate them in the right order. Two other things though and you may either be thrilled to hear them or angry depending on the kind of person you are.

- There is no such thing as a socially acceptable hobby. Just things you enjoy and other cool people who enjoy them too. If you have to change yourself this fundamentally to find friends, you're looking for the wrong friends. That said, you should also never be afraid to try new things if it means adding additional hobbies that could broaden your Social Circle. 

- There is a very good chance that you are likely not autistic. You may have mild assperger's, but so do most intelligent people. Autism is something very different and if you are posting this coherently, you likely don't have it. Hopefully you see this as the blessing that it is, as it means that the social issues you have are just from poor adjustment and not from a crippling incurable disorder of the Mind.

I know all of this sounds like toxic positivity pie in the sky, but I was literally EXACTLY where you are right now when I was 22 and in my 30s I have gotten all of this shit fully under control."	Western_Quantity_103	reply	na	na	na	0.9955344200134277	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"I do not know if this is the right place to post this or if there is even a right place. So I apologize in advance if this isn't the right board. This will be my first post on reddit. I have not been myself for a very long time so I fear that I will not be able to accurately convey my problems in a meaningful way so I again apologize in advance if this comes out as jumbled nonsense. 

I am 31 years old. I have children with a woman that I believe to be a narcissist. Obviously I'm no psychologist so maybe I'm wrong or just making things up. I can't remember the last time I had a day where I haven't been beset by anxiety, confusion and a sense of impending doom. 

My wife lashes out at me on a daily basis for seemingly random reasons. She'll be distant for most of the day only to be loving for some small period of time before going back on the attack. If I disagree with her about anything at all I instantly become the bad guy. Anything. I have to be careful about what topic of discussion I pick lest it be deemed stupid or pointless. Any concerns or worries I might have are instantly trivialized or dismissed. 

I'm nearly positive she has cheated on me in the past. Throughout our whole relationship I think. I could never prove it so I always told myself that it couldn't be true. That she would never do that to me. But I am beginning to realize how incredibly stupid I am. How naive. 

She strategically belittled and insulted my job for so long that I actually quit. She told me that it would be fine for her to carry rhe slack for the couple of weeks that it would take to get a new one.  That if I didn't leave my job I obviously wasn't capable of doing what I was told to do and didn't care about her. So I left. I ignored multiple opportunities to go back. Now she says this is our house because I don't pay bills. She says I'm useless and lazy. She says I am lucky to have someone like her. That I should be grateful that she puts up with me. 

She casually insults me in front of company and her family only to become outraged when I take offense, saying that i need to learn to take a joke. She does this repeatedly, often bringing up certain embarrassing medical issues I have. I know that she constantly badmouths me around others, seeking validation from her family and friends who support her whole heartedly. She talked me into moving away from my family and friends over to another state where her family lives so we could have a ""support"" structure. I don't know what to do. 

I love my kids and don't want to leave them but I don't believe I have a choice. I don't know what to do or where to go. I don't have a driver's license or GED. I do have some family but I don't think they can help. I tried to leave before but when I went to stay with them I came back. They have multiple small dogs and cats. Their floor is covered in dog and cat feces and urine. Literally everywhere. I couldn't find a clean place to put my things. And the whole time she was messaging me telling me that her and the kids missed me and that I could come back if I did better.

I am alone and confused. I don't know what to do. I need advice and someone to talk to. Anyone at all. I know that I have to support my kids no matter what so I need a way to do that. But I know that I can't be a good father to them in this state. Every day is pain and confusion. Anger and horror. 

I don't want to do this anymore. I need help. Please."	Sea-Wrongdoer1085	post	31.73731746905169	male	White	0.9985759258270264	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth

"Hi all, 
Wondering if any of you might help with some steps you have found useful.

Just recently had an argument with my wife.
Background: I live in my wife’s country and all people I’m close to are either her family or her friends. 

Every time I have an argument with her I completed spiral.
For example: I feel shitty for a comment I might have made, I feel judged and alone by the fact I have no one here that would “side” with me. 
(I know that sides is not really a real thing but you know what I mean, it’s her family and her friends, I will always be the “other one”).
I feel alone but at the same I want to be alone. 
Sometimes I feel that if I can’t make her happy than I’d rather no be here at all.
I have thoughts about packing my stuff and leaving. 
Sometimes I feel to just go die somewhere in Ukraine helping them in their fight feeling that would be at least “somewhat useful for someone”. 
Note the term feel. My mind knows that I’m being an idiot. But that’s how I feel.

At the same time I know I’m a coward. 
It takes me 2-3 days to recover from this state, rejecting any attempt my wife or friends do to reach out, do something or even “talk about it”.
I’m a coward for not simply admitting that I might have said or did something incorrectly on the argument, apologise and move on and enjoy the rest of the day I sulk in my own misery closing myself up. 

After a few days I act as I go over it, I act as if nothing happened. 
I hate myself through the entire thing but I can’t seem to be able to say yes. Am I too proud? Coward? 
I don’t know what to do."	Difficult-Willow7094	post	25.048983430107768	male	White	0.9974730610847473	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth

That's it. Some days I feel like I'm able to face it so I talk and get rejected and some days I feel like I can't. 

Is this how it works? What can I do about it?

"Hey brother I've been there before.

There are a few ways to help overcome rejection:

1. Frame it positively. If you're getting rejected, you must be taking action, so you're already a step ahead than you were before
2. Think of it as a numbers game. Social calibration isn't something you learn overnight. The more you expose yourself to a said stimuli, the more you'll become desensitised and start caring less. This doesn't even have to be specific to asking girls out: just asking things that will purposely grant you rejection will help. An example would be something like ""Can I get a handsome-man discount?"" at the coffee shop
3. Learn social dynamics. There's a few great dating coaches out there that create great free content: David Meessen, Gary Gunn, etc.. I did a dating course back in 2018 from a guy called RSD Max, which is where I learnt 90% of what I know about social cues & body language
4. Get out of your head and into your body. Read The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle and start practising mindfulness meditation. When you're present, you're not going to have to rage a battle in your mind of whether or not you should do something"	WorldlinessPlayful72	reply	na	na	na	0.9925373196601868	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"*Sigh*

Man, you’ve got this all wrong. Don’t approach random women on a train. Most women hate being approached by random men at random times. Like you, they have their own business they’re worried about… and what are you offering them by approaching them in the middle of the day? Except that you think they’re attractive, and are presumably interested in sex? It shows zero imagination on your part. It’s a big turn off.

Most single women want to be approached by men who are confident, attractive, and interesting. But you have to do it under the right circumstances. You need to go places where women are also going to meet people.

Bars and clubs are the traditional place men and women go to meet each other. But maybe you’re not interested in the bar/club scene.

So instead, you can go to dance events; art house events; gallery openings; poetry readings; and book clubs. Or whatever. Social events are key here. 

These places are great because people expect to meet other interesting people at events like these. And they have the benefit of providing easy material to talk about, share mutual interests, and get involved in each others’ lives.

They also have the benefit that if you start going to these places and learning about new people and new ideas, you’ll grow as a person. And that will make you more attractive too.

In short, you gotta go where women want to meet people. And then you can approach them, and hopefully find someone who likes you back.

And when you face rejection, don’t let it get you down. Most women aren’t gonna want to date you- but that doesn’t say anything negative about you. It just means that, for whatever reason, most women are looking for something different.

Set yourself up for success. And eventually, you’ll find success."	WorldlinessPlayful72	reply	na	na	na	0.9925373196601868	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"You're not weak or weird for fearing rejection. You're not sensitive if it screws up your day. A bunch of people here are trying to tell you ""frame it positively."" That sounds great, that's not how it works. Rejection activates the exact same areas of your brain as physical pain. It is painful. That's not going to change, despite what all these really tough manly men are claiming. If you can honestly get rejected and turn around and say it's because the other person sucks, you might have a big problem. That is a shocking level of entitlement and an enviable lack of self-awareness that borders on narcissism. It's just more bad dating advice from toxically positive people who don't struggle that much, and mostly just give other people advice to let them know how cool they are. Also don't listen to people who say, ""Just get rejected all the time, you'll get numb to it."" That's also really bad advice, because getting numb to it is not really what you want. That's like saying you should burn yourself every day, so if you accidentally burn yourself you'll be used to it.

Facing rejection takes strong coping skills. But like any other grief or pain, it can be managed. And like with mental illness, you'll have good days and bad days. Good days where you're like, I can handle whatever happens next and bad days where you don't think you can handle a rejection. Forgive yourself for that.

"i'm 15 and i've been stuck for a while. self-confidence has dropped to rock bottom (i'm not the skinniest, to put it lightly) and thoughts are racing through my head. everytime i see someone skinny i fixate about it, try and imagine how it'd be if i were skinny aswell. 

&#x200B;

i know there isn't a way around it other than to put effort into it and exercising and that stuff, but i don't have the energy to maintain the routine and schedule required to get skinny. every day it's getting worse and it's been going on for about 5 months now. 

&#x200B;

in the morning it's usually the worst, when i have to prepare for school. i stare in the mirror for a good minute to look at what kind of a mess i am. i've tried to convince myself that being skinny isn't the most important in life and that i shouldn't be fixating so much, but it keeps turning back.

&#x200B;

i just wish i had more energy to do things instead of sit on a couch for 2 hours a day and see the time wasting away. i usually didn't do that before, so i'm confused why it'd occur now. nothing has changed in sleep schedules, routines or anything. 

&#x200B;

everytime someone gives me a gift or a compliment it feels so fucking awkward, i feel like i don't deserve it. not even 1% of those compliments or gifts would count for me. i feel like i'm disappointing others often, even though i've done nothing.

&#x200B;

i've had adhd since i was a little kid. i took medication since i was 6 but stopped when i was 12 because i've gotten used to the medicine (methylphenidate). i don't think my adhd has vanished completely, but it's less extreme than it was. adhd might be the cause of my struggles, but i'm not a psychologist or whatever, so i don't know... (symptoms include finger tapping and delaying big school projects, if that'd count)

&#x200B;

i've also been overthinking about a relationship i had that ended a year ago. relationship went fine for about 3 months, then turned into your average toxic relationship (fights, dishonesty, etc). the girl i was dating was so much more pretty than i was, and i really feel like i didn't deserve her. it was my first relationship aswell (bonus points?). 

&#x200B;

i don't know what's going on with me, but something has changed. the stuff i'm dealing with are: 

\- low self-esteem, insecure about looks and purpose of life

\- short fuse, irritable, especially when people don't understand me

\- a guilty feeling, that i shouldn't be here and that i'm spoiled (my family isn't poor nor rich)

\- worthlessness, i don't see the meaning in my life, everyday is the same routine even in the weekends and that's all. sometimes me and my dad go out to do something fun, but the joy is starting to fade away

\- thoughts of death/suicide, occasionally (no plans/attempts to commit)

\- overthinking about everything basically

\- feeling i'd never get someone to be with later on in my life (partly because of my very professional relationship..)

&#x200B;

so.. what do i do now? i'm completely stuck, got nothing more to say. i'm just bored i guess. do i visit someone? i don't want to talk about this my dad, he usually doesn't understand"	Cold-Presentation-28	post	20.557347457298256	male	White	0.9981749057769775	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth
"I don’t usually respond to these kind of things but you sound a look like me when I was about your age, I’m 27 now, I know it’s hard and excruciating, I feel you. Good things is that you’re smart enough to recognize and put a name to what you’re feeling, I would suggest you to get help from an specialist, I don’t know maybe you can get some help at school or something (don’t know if that’s available to you). You definitely don’t need to tell anyone (not even your dad) about it if you don’t want / don’t feel ready, what you’re feeling is YOUR feelings and not anyone else and it’s okay to try to deal with it in any “healthy” way you see fit, there isn’t a magic bullet so what worked for me or some else might not work for you but if it helps here are my takeaways from my own experience:

- about your ex, had a similar situation in high school, I saw it the same way you do, eventually we were on an on and off relationship up after collage, we grew up and end it, she got married this year actually and I’m a on relationship that challenges me to be better and talk about what I feel, never been happier and aware of my sorrows
- your body will change through the years, don’t feel guilty about it, just focus on staying healthy, the girl/boy that truly loves you won’t care about a little overweight or if you’re skinny or have a “dream body”, be mature enough to realize that
- it’s ok to feel guilty, but just don’t say there, write what you’re feeling and start taking small steps to change that, whatever it is 
- get out of your comfort zone sometimes, learn to love you and what you like, if you don’t know how can you expect someone else to do it ?

In this day and age, technology has become an integral part of our lives. From smartphones and social media to laptops and online streaming services, we are constantly connected to the digital world, or what I would “the slave world”

That's why I wrote a blog about why taking a step back to technology for a few days might benefit you mentally. At least it did for me, as I get less distracted by social media and I spend more time with my family. Which made me feel less lonely and enhanced my mental health.

"I posted here a while ago. So far I've been a bit better. But removing one layer, I find another layer I don't understand.

My situation, I have high self-expectations, which causes me to be very focused on work. I realize my goals are unrealistic so I try to practice self-compassion. Currently, am a final year student, preparing to find work.

But there is something I do, which I don't understand.

1. I have a unreasonable reason to hate a group of people, I try to put people down. I am pulled towards toxic people, I know its bad for me but I want to join them. I can't stop thinking about the hate speech the speak. I don't know why I hate anyone, but I want to stop.  
\#I used to hangout with this guy, which caused some sort of trauma. Everything about him just makes me angry. He was manipulative and controlling.
2. I also daydream a lot, imagining myself as some sort of Epic human, sort of a superior complex.I have a very active alter ego, someone I pretend to be for some reason. It happens when I walk, listen to music, and doing my work. I stop it for a while then few minutes later it has taken over me, then I live in my daydream world.  
\#I've been like this since I was a child. the only time my mind is quiet is when I am doing homework. I use work to cope, but so far it hasn't been working.  


I've met this new girl, and I want to be mentally ready before I get into the relationship, but for some reason when I think about her, I just hate her. I imagine scenarios where bad things happen.  
\#This also occurs to friends, and family. Deep down I like them, but for some reason I imagine bad things happening

This is affecting me greatly in my work and life, I want to be a down to earth rational human.

Any advice, and why am I like this?"	ultimatesanjay	post	13.8364720474065	male	White	0.9972600936889648	na	na	na	4	malementalhealth
"ChatGPT's answer:  
I am not a mental health professional, but I can offer some general advice and insights that might help you understand your situation better. It's important to consult a therapist or counselor who can provide personalized guidance and support.**Addressing**

 **high self-expectations**: It's good that you recognize your unrealistic expectations and are practicing self-compassion. Continue to work on setting more achievable goals and remind yourself that nobody is perfect. Accepting your limitations can help you feel more grounded and less prone to seeking validation through negative behaviors.

**Dealing with negativity and hate**: It's possible that your past experiences with toxic people or the manipulative person you mentioned have influenced your current thought patterns. To break free from these negative cycles, try to distance yourself from toxic environments and people. Surround yourself with positive influences and engage in activities that promote kindness and empathy, such as volunteering or joining support groups.

**Understanding your daydreams and alter ego**: Daydreaming can be a form of escapism, which might be your way of coping with stress or dissatisfaction with your current situation. It's essential to identify and address the root causes of your dissatisfaction, which could help reduce your need for escapism. Practicing mindfulness and grounding techniques can help you become more present and engaged in your daily life.

**Managing negative thoughts about loved ones**: It's not uncommon for people to have intrusive thoughts, but it's important to remind yourself that these thoughts don't define who you are. When you notice these thoughts, try to acknowledge them without judgment and let them pass. If they persist, consider seeking professional help from a therapist who can provide you with effective strategies for managing them.

**Preparing for a new relationship**: Before entering a new relationship, it's crucial to work on your mental and emotional well-being. A healthy relationship requires trust, vulnerability, and open communication. If you're struggling with negative emotions, it's essential to address them first. A therapist or counselor can help you develop coping strategies and improve your emotional intelligence.

In summary, it's crucial to seek professional help to better understand and address the underlying issues that may be contributing to your thoughts and behaviors. A mental health professional can help you develop healthy coping strategies and guide you towards a more emotionally balanced life."	ultimatesanjay	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9972600936889648	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"Hello everyone,

I am a person who values organization and schedules as it makes my life smoother and more time-efficient. However, I have noticed that when something unexpected happens, I tend to become irritated and sometimes even bitter.

Recently, I experienced this while traveling with my friends. We had trouble finding a place to eat for lunch, and instead of looking for one, my friends started to roam around the city randomly. At first, I got angry, but then I joined them and had fun. However, I still had a part of me that was irritated.

To give some context, I am a teenager who appreciates routines and likes to have things organized. I recognize that this trait can sometimes lead to inflexibility and frustration in unexpected situations.

I am seeking advice on how to cope with unexpected situations without becoming bitter or irritated. Have any of you experienced something similar? How do you balance your need for organization and routine with the need to be flexible and adaptable in life? I am open to any advice or tips. Thank you in advance for your help.

TLDR. I value organization and routines but struggle with unexpected situations. I recently became frustrated when traveling with friends who did not plan ahead. I am seeking advice on how to cope with unexpected situations without becoming bitter or irritated."

"You don't have to be a perfect feminist to be a feminist.

You don't need others to validate your feminism.

There is such a wide diversity of thought between feminists that it's impossible to please every single one. Just be a good person and treat women as people. 

Even in the scenario where you were offered a promotion at work, it wouldn't be totally wrong to accept it. We're all trying to survive and build our lives up. If someone tries to make you feel bad for something good happening to you, tell them to go choke on a fat dick.

The only time you should not accept a promotion at work is if you were absolutely certain that you would not be able to perform the job adequately and the woman passed up would do a better job than you. 

Don't listen to femcels with spicy takes on tiktok. Just block them and move on with your life. Be a good person and advocate for things like paid maternity and parental leave, which would directly improve the lives of both men and women. Advocate for workplace protections so women don't lose their jobs and can take paid time off while they're pregnant to ensure healthy babies are born.

I have a genetic history as well, but at just 22 it is non acceptable for me. But anyways I am going through it, suffering through it from like 3 years. It affected my social and love life. I don't think I can attract any women now because of my low self esteem. I feel some important part of my identity is just taken away from me and I can never be same.

However, If you're like me who just wants to hold for a bit, for me I'll reevaluate in my 30s, I'd take it.

Take it from a man who started losing it at 17, fight it off as long as you can, and save whatever money you have so you can afford a transplant.

"Hey bro. It’s unfortunate that you have to go through these circumstances at a relatively early age. While some may choose to “own it” and shave bald, which I’m sure you’ve already heard of at this point but I suppose you find it difficult to go on this path.
While the problem you’re facing is balding at an early age and that triggered the insecurities, depression, hurt etc I suspect there’s more behind this.
My suggestion would be to explore why you feel being bald makes you unacceptable. Have you always felt some degree of unacceptable ness about yourself? Does balding intensifies this?
I’d think if you have an internal worldview of being good enough or acceptable, then balding probably wouldn’t affect you to this extent.
Of course, I may be mistaken. But if it is the case that you have an internal view of being not good enough or unacceptable for who you are, then I think this is what needs further exploration"	harshal2797	reply	na	na	na	0.985270619392395	strong	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"Where do you live?

And do you have options to receive therapy?

Everyone makes mistakes and a relapse is no different.

If you can acknowledge that it was a mistake and try to get back on the road to recovery, then you are already doing better than most people.

The people who get clean on day one sometimes end up relapsing 10 years later, and never get back out of it.

The people who relapse several times in the first couple of years but learn what to do when they relapse often end up doing much better in the long-run.

You need to get out of the situation that you're in though.

The number one thing I hear is that it's friends and family and other connections that lead to relapse.  Even though they're not ""drug users"", they don't seem like they want to see you as someone who is making progress, which is not helping you.

I used to work at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center.  I saw this every day from probably thousands of people over the years.

You need to find a new place to live, a new job, and new habits / hobbies in your life.

Start exercising and getting out into nature if you can.

Your post history puts you in the US. 

Look up the United Way or 211.  You can call / text 211.  There are also 211 websites to do it all online (Google 211 + your state / city).

-Read a book called, ""The Body Keeps the Score"", it changed everything for me. Maybe it won't help everyone but it's good enough that I think many may find value in the core of it. 

-Stand in front of the bathroom mirror and work on how you look when you say, ""no"". I found that practicing various forms of saying ""no"" and of turning others down in favor of myself really aided me in being able to do it IRL. It gave me like social practice? I guess is a good way to put it.

"This isn't an issue of empathy but agreeableness. Lower agreeableness is correlated to many potentially favorable conditions like being at the top of dominance hierarchies in professional organizations, for example.

Being disagreeable at times can expose one to risk, e.g. to social or physical harm, but when one succeeds in these, respect for them markedly increases. Weaker or more unsure individuals need to run stricter ""consensus"" checks on what they say to the degree that they're dependent for good outcomes for them. Making one's self more resilient so they can challenge things or be challenged should be a priority. Things you can do to increase your resilience:

* Increase your income
* Diversify income sources
* Strengthen one's options for career progress and moves to other organizations and positions
* Lift and gain muscle
* practice martial arts
* carry a gun
* consciously curate your appearance
* read about and practice debating, rhetoric, and negotiating.

Curating one's reputation can also help so their character is less assailable.

These can give firmer ground to stand on so one can plant their heels when it matters.

Consciously judge your social standing in certain groups to determine the degree you might need to make concessions. For example, if you're new to or junior within an organization, more concessions may be necessary. Even then, one should put a limit on special requests much sooner rather than later.

He just did it naturally. He is better than me, intrinsically and inherently he is superior to me. He is a winner and a champ and he literally towers over me and my life. The overwhelming majority of people can achieve social success totally naturally in their youth just by being themselves.

People who are more attractive than me are better than me, people who have social lives and SO’s are better than me, people who have more experience are better than me, people who are more talented and successful are better than me, people who aren’t autistic or neurodivergent are better than me, people who are having the time of their lives at college parties and social gatherings are better than me, people who are boundlessly charismatic and interesting are better than me, people who regularly have romantic and sexual encounters are better than me, people who haven’t had to expend so much years and effort just to achieve even the smallest amount of social success are better than me, the average social teenager is better than me.

"TW: suicidal ideation, ableism, religious homophobia, internalized homophobia, and abuse by parent

So I’m a bisexual man. I consider myself a feminist. I believe in equality of the sexes, I believe women currently aren’t treated by society as equals, I know women face more physical and sexual violence, I believe men are socialized in a toxic way that can be fixed and that men can be better, and I’m a staunch advocate for egalitarian parenting (mainly because I’m the son of a deadbeat dad).

But being a feminist is a difficult thing for me. I have some trust issues with women from living under an abusive single mother who insults my appearance and my weight, makes ableist remarks (I’m autistic) frequently calling me the r-word, and has even been physically violent to me one time pushing me against the wall and screaming “I hate you” in my face. And I find this has made being intimate (even just platonically connecting emotions) with women difficult, I want to work on this with a therapist. But I still see women as my equal and want to advocate for them and to build better relationships and friendships with them. 

But about 6 months ago things got a lot harder. I discovered threads on many subreddits of women (in particular queer women) talking about how awful men are. Some of them were lesbians talking about how awful they’re experiences with gay men were. Others were bi women joking that if sexuality was a choice, who would choose men? Some of them were just generally talking about how men are just awful. About how men are violent. How men are the oppressors. Think of every negative thought about men and I’ve seen it.

I know these are vents about experiences and (in the case of the bi women “if sexual orientation was a choice” remarks) jokes. I know feminism doesn’t hate men. I know they don’t mean all men. But it still makes me feel guilt over being a cis man and for loving other cis men. If cis men are so bad bi women wish they weren’t attracted to other cis men, am I a bad person for being a cis man and for really really liking the idea of sleeping and having a relationship with a fellow cis man? Am I betraying women if I act on my same-sex desires and enjoy it? Am I privileged just for being capable of romantically/sexually loving any cis man? Am I betraying women by loving the men I sleep with? 

I know it’s not true. Many cis men are allies to women, especially queer cis men since queer cis men tend to be more pro-feminism than straight cis men. Also are straight and bi women who genuinely romantically and sexually love their cis boyfriends privileged and betraying their fellow women? No! They’re just in a healthy loving relationship that’s harming no one. And if I were in a relationship with a non-problematic non-misogynistic cis man, it would also be a happy loving relationship that would be harming no one!

This shouldn’t bother me but it does. I know this. I shouldn’t feel guilty over my sexuality. I know I can have sex with men and still be an ally to feminism. I know this. But my anxiety tells me otherwise. I also have autism and tend to read things literally in the first place so I sometimes can’t tell if people are joking.

And a lot of this is just insecurity from growing up in the Bible Belt and being surrounded by people in my community (not in my family. My family is rather progressive) all telling me my sexuality is a sin against God. So the anxiety is that, what if being a cis-man-loving-cis-man is wrong? I know it’s not. The women venting know it’s not. No one on the left is against me. 

I want to be a male ally who listens and advocates for women. And the rational part of my brain knows they don’t mean all men, but it still makes me feel guilty for loving fellow cis men. I know it shouldn’t. I know rationally that not all men are misogynistic, violent, or transphobic. How do I get over this BS anxiety?

How do I remind myself the problem isn’t individual cis men like myself or my potential partners (who can potentially be wonderful non-misogynistic allies) it’s a systemic issue of power, privilege and socialization? How do I remind myself of it so often that I don’t take it so personally?"	Final_Bookkeeper_862	post	27.435538752505174	female	White	0.23451818525791168	na	na	na	9	malementalhealth

Peoples obsession with the patriarchy blinds them to the matriarchy (I don't actually believe either exists independent of the other and that all there are are shitty humans of both genders) but feminism focuses on the patriarchy while giving the matriarchy a pass.

Feminism isn't about hating cis men. Though there may be feminists who voice strong opinions about men, but you can just ignore them. They can't revoke your Feminist card, and you have nothing to prove to anyone to be an ally. Not even to your mother.

Though critical analysis of all material conditions throughout history requires acknowledging that cis men have held an overwhelming majority of the world's wealth and power throughout history, you can also recognize that there is a class difference between you and the people who have controlled the world.

Feminist theory is not easy or simple to fully comprehend. It requires a lot of learning and a lot of examination.

"> But being a feminist is a difficult thing for me

Good. Feminism is an ideology of hatred.

""So, there's this group of people, who exclude the rest of us, hoard all the money, will shank you if you're not careful around them, think they're better than you are, and are generally the cause of all problems in modern society...""

Question: was the above statement written by an antisemite describing Jews, or a feminist describing patriarchy?

There is so much to say about feminism being a hate group. Historically from the very beginning - the days of Elizabeth Cady Stanton (at least in the U.S.), to modern day, feminism has always attracted and given a platform to people who fucking hate you. 

If you've bought into the message of feminism, but you're feeling cognitive dissonance over it and are confused and upset about how to proceed, it's because what really happened is you were lied to and lied about, using logic that seems legit at first glance but sucks you in like a tidepool into hating men - and if you're a man, either hating yourself or somehow believing you're not ""that kind of man"", the kind they're actually talking about. Meanwhile, to the feminists you're trying to appease, you are *absolutely* the same kind of man they've built their entire worldview around loathing.

You want my advice? Reject everything about feminism. Start over completely. If you want an understanding of human rights and to build a philosophical basis for truly understanding the social contract, I suggest reading John Locke, Adam Smith, and other classical liberal thinkers. Because frankly? Feminists like to claim they want equality, but they have absolutely no idea where that notion actually comes from or the colossal philosophical endeavor it was to create. 

They don't know what equality actually is; they just assume they don't have it and blame men for that, while preaching the moral superiority of women, rewriting history to fit their victim narrative, and generally acting exactly like every other group that spreads hatred and a message of supremacy. And they always have."	Final_Bookkeeper_862	reply	na	na	na	0.23451818525791168	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"Just for some context: I have been suicidal in the past and put on the watchlist when I was 17, I'm 19 now. I had a surgery to treat hydrocephalus that was undiagnosed for god knows how long, the surgery took place almost a year after I was put on the watchlist. Before my mood was very low, my memory was non existent and I'd sleep 14-16 hours a day. I'd wake up in the early morning to a cold dinner on my desk and ask my mom about it only for her to tell me we had a full conversation when she brought it to me (non of which I remember.) Doctors said the condition could be a cause for the low mood and I'd say they were right, I no longer feel that way unless I'm under extreme stress, but even then it only lasts less than a day. 

The reason for me writing this is because I'm unsure, from time to time, I have this urge to destroy myself, not even because I'm sad or anything. I will have these thoughts about my head being crushed by boulders or be blown up from the inside, having my flesh shredded off by high pressure water or something. I can't explain why but it gives me a sense of euphoria and weightlessness, it's calming and soothing.

Am I actually sick in the head or is there a somewhat general explanation for this? Just a question."	ChewedGum300119	post	30.23666522854669	female	White	0.003037577960640192	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth

"Honestly… I don’t know how much longer I can take it for. I keep telling myself each time that I’ll be better but I’m not and I never get better. I’ve been on a cocktail of antidepressants and psychotherapy, but nothings worked. 

I want to cry, but I cannot seem to release any emotions. I want to hug someone, but I don’t have anyone to hug. I want someone to love, but no one loves me. 

I know that there’ll be a day where I won’t be able to take it anymore and do something that is “silly”. But, the thought of it brings me a sense of peace and gives me a good chuckle at times. 

I feel utterly useless. I don’t even have the courage to kill myself, I plan, but can never actually do it. I’m a coward. I really want to die, but I just can’t get over the fact that I’ll be a burden ever after I die. 

I know it sounds like I’m asking for people to pity me and maybe deep down that’s what I want. But, my intentions are just to share what I’ve been bottling up that I’ve never had the courage to share with people around me.

"I am very sorry you feel the way you do :(. I wish there was some arrangement of words I could use to make it all better. When the ups are moderate and the downs are terrible things can look bleak and some proper rest can appear to be the solution. In reality, life is work. And it certainly is not fair. Some people get to suffer a lot more than others. 

Learning how to manage Planet You should be a class in school. I hope you will find a way to work out these issues you have because when you are successful, life won't be a task. In fact you might find some beauty in it somewhere. I know I did. It will only happen when not all your energy is draining toward the depression. 

Also, please. Always keep reaching out for help. You deserve some help and it is ok to be a bit of a burden until you are better. Forgive yourself for being who you are and forgive yourself for needing help. Other people thrive on helping people in need, so you're doing them a service :). Especially a good psychologist is really important. They're all good, you just need to find the one that you trust, because it is all about you trusting them. It sounds like it is a good idea to intensify the help you are getting.

"We all have an inner critic that tells us we're not good enough, smart enough, or talented enough, that little voice in our head that criticizes us and makes us doubt ourselves. This inner critic can be particularly harsh when we make mistakes or fail at something.

But why do we have an inner critic? Throughout childhood, we hear a lot of harsh remarks and criticism from the people around us, including our parents, caretakers, teachers, and peers. Even hearing the adults in our life speak harshly about themselves can leave a lasting impression. This can have a significant impact on the way our brains develop, as we internalize this harsh language and it becomes our inner critic. As we move into adulthood, this inner critic can become the filter through which we see the world.

So, how can we overcome our inner critic and become our own inner coach? The answer is self-compassion. Self-compassion is the act of being kind, gentle, and understanding with ourselves. It's about treating ourselves with the same kindness and compassion that we would offer to a good friend.

Research has shown that self-compassion can lead to a wide range of benefits, including increased happiness, reduced stress and anxiety, and improved physical health. When we're kind to ourselves, we're more likely to take care of our physical and emotional needs, which leads to greater overall wellbeing. Basically what we’re aiming for is the voice inside you becoming your ally and supporter rather than tearing you down. I remember the first time my inner voice responded with kindness rather than judgement and it was a game changer for me.

So how do we cultivate compassion for ourselves? The first step is to learn to separate ourselves from our thoughts. We are not our thoughts, we're actually the awareness that observes our thoughts. It can be a bit tricky to wrap our heads around at first, because we tend to identify strongly with our thoughts and believe they define us. But thoughts are just passing mental events that come and go in our minds. They are not fixed or permanent, and they don't define who we are as people. We can learn to observe our thoughts without getting caught up in them, and this can help us to not get swept away by self critical thoughts.

When we realise that our thoughts don't define us, we can learn to observe them without getting caught up in them. It's like watching a storm from far away instead of being in the middle of it - we can still feel it, but we're not overwhelmed by it. This can help us see things more clearly and feel stronger even when we're dealing with tough emotions.

It's also important to pay attention and look deeply to our thoughts when they're happening. Each time we notice a difficult thought, it's a chance for us to learn more about why we're feeling that way. For example, if we keep thinking negative things about ourselves, it might be because we were bullied in the past. Instead of getting scared or upset by these thoughts, we can try to understand where they're coming from and show compassion for ourselves. Gaining insight from our difficult thoughts is a key part of the path of freeing ourselves from suffering.

Finally, we can set the intention every day to change the language we use to speak to ourselves. Think about it - how often do we say things to ourselves that we would never say to someone else? This negative self-talk can have a huge impact on our well-being. That's why it's important to regularly check in with the language we use, and ask ourselves if it's true and kind.

When we catch ourselves saying something negative, we can test if it's true. Is it really true that we're not good enough, or that we'll never succeed? Often, these thoughts are just stories we tell ourselves, and they don't reflect reality.

Once we've tested if it's true, we can then ask ourselves if it's kind. Would we say this to a friend who is struggling? Of course not! So why do we say it to ourselves? Instead, we can set the intention to use words of compassion towards ourselves every day. We can speak to ourselves with the same kindness and support that we would offer to a good friend.

"I'm a 28 years old male, not that it matters much. I have never been diagnosed with anything, and even tho I think I might be in the future (due to some symptoms and stuff), it's safe for me to say that my mental health is relatively balanced.

I'm a sensitive guy who cries easily at things most sensitive people would (for example some music or movies, some situations, etc). With that said, there's one thing that bugs me a lot, and it is the fact that I feel like crying at a lot of things I ""shouldn't"", mostly things (but not all) related to children or childhood. Be it a small shoe, a kid's show, some cute drawing or printed shirt, or some toys, maybe a candy shaped like a bear etc you know? This kind of stuff.

I have no fucking clue why this happens. I had a pretty normal/good childhood, no traumas, nothing too bad happened (the worst I can think is when my parents divorced, of course I felt horrible but I adapted and got over it fast, their relationship improved a lot after that too, and I always felt like it was for the best).

The best explanation I can think of is that it must have something to do with some deep ingrained feeling like grief (???) for the loss of innocence we all go through as life goes on, or something along those lines. I talked to a psychologist about this once but honestly I don't even remember what he said anymore. It's been some time since, and it did not make much sense to me back in the day.

Have any of you felt like this or know a possible explanation?

I lost my mom when I was 12 and it obviously was incredibly difficult to deal with. 
By now, I feel like I’ve worked through it, but I guess part of me feels like I’ve had part of my childhood taken from me, having to deal with that kind of circumstances at a young age.

I was in a fender bender May of 2021. I live very isolated about an hour drive from the nearest town across the state border. But it's 3 hour drive from my home town where my mom lives. I was driving to my home town to pick up a new phone, because I had broken my phone. And this asshole came to a dead stop in the fast lane and I couldn't break in time. 

I couldn't take  his information like he did mine. I couldn't take pictures of it and I didn't have a pen or paper in my car. Racist asshole wouldn't even call the cops when I begged him to.

I had to drive into town worried that maybe my breaks were no god and that they had failed. Went to the police station, filed my report and call my insurance from my mom's house phone. Didn't seem like that big a deal after thay. Bumped out the dent, and insurance said they would cover handle his side of things for me. I thought it was behind me. It was my first ever car accident. 

But apparently he went to the hospital and I was viewed ""At Fault"". According to my insurance: even though they payed him enough to pay the medical, he layerd up and wants to sue me for $15000. Insurance says they're going to provide me a layer but I still feel alone and scared.

"If those are pictures you've posted of yourself... You're a fucking gorgeous man. Seriously. I'm not 6' tall but I still found myself being asked out when I simply just started shaving regularly, dressing better, and lifting weights 

My dad went bald, but (knock on wood) I seem to have inherited my mom's genetics. Or maybe I live a less stressful and healthier life than my dad did. You don't know what will happen, so don't stress yourself out waiting for the worst to occur.

Skin cancer runs heavy in my family, and I'm covered in unsightly moles. My skin is so pale that I skip tanning and go straight to burning. I have plenty of things I could focus on that I know people find unattractive about me, but I choose to focus on my strengths instead.

You honestly need to take a step back and compliment yourself. You've got a 10/10 face and your skin glows under whatever lighting you took those pictures with. Your body is still producing peak levels of testosterone and won't start tapering down for a few more years, so hit the weights and try to make sure you're getting proper nutrition.

Another way to make sure you keep your hair is by eating healthy and take care of your scalp. If your scalp is dry and flaky, try talking to a barber or a hair stylist about what products might help. (I personally love tea tree products).

Lastly, one of my best friends stands at about 5'3"". He told me about all the shit he would get for his height. His retort was usually, ""Guess how many short jokes I've heard... the answer is *all of them*.""

There will always be people who will try to put you down to lift themselves up. You don't have to allow them into your life. But if they're truly your friends, then they'll listen to you and respect your feelings about it. If you won't bring it up because you don't believe they'll respect your wishes, then why are you even associating with them?"	itswhatever1102	reply	na	na	na	0.9983603358268738	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"This will be a bit of a rant but hopefully you read it and it gets through to you.  I am 5’7.  

From around age 8 to 15 I was obese, not attractive.  On the verge of entering high school I starved myself and worked out non stop with no direction and limited internet resources to follow, dropped 55 pounds.  Hit high school and was now of age to go to the gym without parental guidance and started getting fairly muscular for a 16-18 year old.  Met a very attractive girl, we dated for the better part of five years, the last two of those I was in college, working part time, eating garbage food because it was quick and easy, upon graduation I was now a ball of fat.  

Moved across the country at the age of 21 for work opportunities and got her to come with me.  We ended up breaking up for good a few months later.  I was now single in a city compared to the small town I grew up in (this place had night clubs and strip clubs, we didn’t have those where I grew up).  I went out with my friends to a night club and saw all the beautiful women running around in the most revealing outfits and thought to myself, “if I continue to look like this I am never going to get to fuck any of these women”.

Worked out and starved myself for 2 weeks, bought a scale, 276 pounds… at 5’7….. I started using plenty of fish (no tinder back then) and no one would respond to my messages.  So on went my depression driven quest to lose weight to pull pussy.  The more I lost, the more girls started noticing me, answering me on dating apps, approaching me first in bars/clubs.  I ended up yo-yoing in weight a lot in the process but eventually reached 166 pounds and then went on a quest to build muscle because I hated how I was skinny fat(skinny everywhere but still had a saggy gut and I wanted abs).  

I am 34 years old now.  At one point I briefly had abs but for the most part I have hovered at a blocky, muscular physique with no definition and a gut because I love food too much.  I hate my appearance, I am covered in stretch marks, I have extra skin from the weight loss, I have a baby face, I am awkward and introverted, and I have body dysmorphia so I still see obesity in the mirror.  I have zero self confidence in dating and don’t think any women have any interest in me, ever.  

But they do.  I have had a very busy dating career since losing the weight with very attractive women.  I have no idea what they see in me or why they pursue me, but it happens.  If my current relationship ended and I was on tinder tomorrow, for some reason attractive women will swipe right on me.  The only thing I can see as attractive about myself is I’m funny, most people find me enjoyable to speak to because I can always think of the most idiotic and hilarious things to say.  

What’s the point of me telling you all of this?

We are the same height, and I looked through your profile and you are not obese like I was or unattractive.  You do not need to go through what I did to get people to pay attention and have interest in you.  

Take care of yourself, lift weights, eat healthy, dress as nicely as you can afford with appropriate fitting clothing to your body type.  Practice good hygiene and self maintenance, don’t look disheveled.  Make a funny dating app profile, and even though you have no self confidence, message women as they appear in your matches and say funny things, talk to them about nothing.  Don’t tell them how beautiful they are in stupid corny ways thinking this will get you anywhere, they know they are pretty because every idiot on tinder is telling them that.  Don’t hound them or rush them to meet you in person.  Just talk to them, joke with them, make them laugh, don’t ask them to meet, if you are doing it right they will eventually ask you “when are we going to hangout?”.  

I hate looking at myself in the mirror and have no idea why anyone would ever swipe right on me, let alone sleep with me or enter a long term relationship with me.  But if I went on tinder tomorrow, the matches would accumulate and the conversations would begin.  No matter what you think of yourself the actions of others will start to outweigh what you think, your confidence will develop, and things will improve. 

It’s a tall mountain to climb, and you will take steps backwards, but no one gets to the top without starting at the bottom, and taking one step at a time.

Hey man you’re super young and have a lot of life to live! Believe it or not, personality, wit, intelligence, health- those things mean more to women. And if a woman is set on finding a 6 ft tall guy then that’s not the lady for you! Being bald can also be sexy so, it’s really about your outlook on life and what you’re going to do about the situation you’re in given the cards you have. You can’t become taller, but you can learn to love and accept yourself just as you are and constantly improve yourself in the ways that are within your power- strength, intellect, being interesting by having hobbies. If you’re type 2 diabetic I’d recommend staying on top of your diet now and avoid becoming insulin dependent like the plague- through diet and exercise. I promise you, I know many “shorter” men (I honestly don’t think 5’7 is short though) in my life who are always pulling in the ladies. Be funny and kind and listen to what the person you’re courting is saying. Be chivalrous and open doors, tell her she’s beautiful, make her laugh, be affectionate and make her feel safe. Confidence and owning who you are in every way, being open to new ideas and improving and  having discipline will take you very very far in life, and ideally make you happier!

Hey dude, lots of good advice on here but I will just add some comment about the height thing. I’m mid 30s and been lifting weights for a long time. I’m 5’6” 170lbs / 76k and haven’t been called “small” in a long time, like the last time someone said anything was before I bulked up. Being shorter and having a decent amount of muscle with low bodyfat looks great too! Also, you are 5’7” so a pair of boots or Air Force 1 sneakers will put you very close to 5’9” (average height) anyway!	itswhatever1102	reply	na	na	na	0.9983603358268738	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"TL DR; Hey everyone bit of a rant here but I have no where else to get it off my chest so enjoy. 

I’m a 22 year old male and I’m just completely burnt out. For the last 5 years or so I’ve felt like every year is progressively worse or has some ups but then goes downhill again for the rest of the year. Between relationships, work, friendships, etc I can’t keep up. I went through 2 horribly toxic relationships and learned a lot but It took so much out of me and I’m still trying to recover. I work full time in a mentally draining job but I’m grateful to have it and love my co workers but it takes a lot out of me but like it is what it is. After work I spend 95% of my time learning about the stock market, real estate, reading business and self help books etc. It’s work after work and it’s exhausting but I’m hoping eventually it’ll pay off but for now it’s sacrificing a lot of time and energy. 

My social life is almost non existent I’m a small circle kind of person but that small circle kind of just took my ex’s side and kicked me out in a way lol (same friend group) I’m currently going through a breakup that’s been hard and I noticed that I throw myself into my work and the gym as a distraction but get the odd cry in. I’ve also been trying really hard to continue to build a relationship with God because that’s something really important to me. Lastly I’m barely sleeping. It’s not that I’m staying up because I’m playing video games or anything like that I haven’t touched social media or games or anything like that besides Reddit in months but it feels like when I lay my head down to sleep that’s when all the thoughts and everything come out and I have a hard time sleeping which makes it difficult to function at work at times, which leads to me feeling even more burnt out. I hate having a mentality of the world against me or feeling sorry for myself or anything like that but I’m just so burnt out and exhausted emotionally and it’s just a crappy time at the moment."

"My guy, I want you to know I get it. You are not alone.  I'm a 32 year old, Christian,  Father, and Husband.  It's easy to burn yourself out.

It seems to me like you are trying to run from your emotions instead of feeling and proccessing them.

I'm not sure if you're looking for advice or not,but if you are, then this would be mine....

Slow down, take the time to grieve and process your emotions.

If I were you, I'd take a couple things every night and replace them with finding your way into God presence and processing  your emotions with him.  When you pray, pray for God to take your thoughts captive and show you the Truth of what you're feeling and experiencing. Once you start to do this it will get easier and easier. God will surround you in his comfort and give you peace. This I know to be true.

As for your ex/friends, the truth will always come to the forefront eventually. Don't dwell on this to much, and give control of the latest situation over to God to handle,  and pray for His will to be done.

I hope this helps.

"Dear World,

I am writing this note with a heavy heart, seeking and begging for your forgiveness for my pathetic and weak existence. I am sorry for the pain and disappointment I may have caused you all through my cowardly acts and weak display of character.

My entire life has been a complete failure; I have been consumed by fear, self-doubt, and discouragement that it has rendered me powerless in almost all aspects of my life. I have tried so hard to fit in and be accepted, but it seems like no matter how much I try, my efforts are always not good enough.

I am sorry for all the times I let you down, for all the opportunities I squandered and wasted because I was too timid to seize the moment. I am sorry for all the people whose trust and love I lost because I could not face my shortcomings.

I know that taking my own life is not the solution, but I cannot bear the pain and the emptiness that I feel inside anymore. I cannot bear living in this world that expects too much from me when I clearly cannot deliver.

I hope that one day you can find it in your hearts to forgive me for my cowardice and inadequacy. I hope that you can move past my shortcomings and failures and remember me for the good that I once was.

To my family, friends and loved ones, I am sorry that I couldn't be the strong and dependable person that you deserved. I hope that my death brings you some form of closure and relief from the burden that I have become in your lives.

I will leave this world with a prayer in my heart that one day the world will be a better place where acceptance, kindness, and love abound, may nobody else ever feel the isolation and pain that I have felt during my life.

I hope that when I am gone, the world becomes brighter and filled with more hope and happiness. Goodbye, world. Please forgive me.

Yours sincerely,

Liam"		post	27.09119564050729	male	White	0.012714697048068047	na	na	na	8	malementalhealth

The ""I'm sorry"" part of your letter is interesting. It's sad we live in world where some people are truly mad at you for attempting or considering suicide. Truly a dimension entrenched in greed and selfishness, while masquerading as rewarding and positive. I know there is something wrong with me, too, yet I keep going. I know you can, too. What keeps you going could be wanting to help the world, and the future of this humankind lifetime. Or simply to seek out the array of short pleasures one can squeeze from it. We knew growing up, this wasn't going to be easy. Just know that you are more than your memories and experiences. You are one of many here trying to create a better future for other souls that may spread their wings in this dimension. To be honest, brother, I wouldn't blame you if you did. At all. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time but never had the courage to do it. I believe it's your right to make that decision. Just know that everything past that gate is uncertain, and you have familiarity in this world. Hopefully, there are some things you enjoy and cherish.

"""relief from the burden""? Considering you say your family ""deserved"" a strong and dependable person, I assume your family are good people, and that presumably love you. So killing yourself definitely won't give them ""relief"", at least not more than it will bring them sorrow.

I am also consumed by fear and self-doubt but it's not my fault. I was severely and consistently verbally and emotionally abused, belittled, mocked, and degraded throughout my life. And I assume your inadequacies are largely not your fault either. Try to distract from the emptiness and worthlessness you feel, even though at times it will definitely consume you... sometimes for weeks or months at a time. Recognize it, and try to shove it aside and occupy and distract your thoughts with easily digestible and light entertainment like YouTube or Reddit, grab a snack and watch a video.

"I can never stop thinking, no matter how my hobbies I take up. Being depressed, I took peoples advice to make the world my oyster, to do things and travel wherever I want. But no matter how many things I see everything feels empty. The responsibility we have is wrong, the world itself, life, it’s all wrong. Do you know how many animals and plants have died out? Only 1% of all life on earth that has ever lived isn’t extinct. Life itself, in my opinion, is an anomaly. It’s trying to survive, carve out an existence for itself. Many can still find joy in it, and for them I am so very happy. However, this cannot be the case for us all. I must say, I do not see myself as enlightened, quite the opposite really. I don’t find joy in hobbies, work, travel. Such things hold no meaning to me. Again, others find joy in it, but not me. 

“Find joy in the little things.”

“It gets better.”

“Life has no meaning; so the world is your oyster.”

If these statements help you, I’m glad. But to me, they feel like lies. I don’t want consciousness anymore. I no longer want pain, sadness, not even joy. I don’t want to perceive the ills of the world, be held responsible for things other people did, and not my own agency. Not only that, in general, everything is just so—complicated. So many places, so many skills and hobbies, so many people. When I didn’t exist I didn’t have to know any of this. I don’t want to know any of this, and that’s a feeling I just can’t explain. I guess It’s just, the blissful nature of the abyss will always draw me back in."	Spirited_Purchase_32	post	26.976026516009224	female	White	0.9984904527664185	na	na	na	2	malementalhealth
The secret to life is enjoying the passing of time. Sometimes when you pay enough attention to things beyond your control, you feel overburdened and miserable. When you make declarations about Right or Wrong… these are subjective concepts. There isn’t much evidence to support there being a meaning to life. Life just is. Depression, in many cases, is a sign you are overly aware. It’s not a bad idea to seek help from being trapped in negativity via speaking to a therapist and sometimes, medicating. And practicing mindfulness, and learning to let go of emotions that don’t serve you well. And learning how to reign yourself in to your sphere of influence when outside stimulus becomes overbearing. Life is not a question; there is not necessarily an answer to it.	Spirited_Purchase_32	reply	na	na	na	0.9984904527664185	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

It's important to have meaningful relationships outside of your partnership with your wife.  So sharing your problems with friends is normal and healthy.  If your wife becomes concerned about it, simply let her her know that you find your friends advice very helpful because of his experience.  And remind her that her advice on most things is important to you as well.	Dolomite010	reply	na	na	na	0.006964016705751419	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
The best people to talk about your problems to are therapists and maybe friends.  It's a you thing and just remember that sometimes people give bad advice.  Try to think of all the different options you have and steps you can take to feel better. Focus on things you can have direct control over such as your sleep schedule, diet, exercise, hobbies, and relaxing things.  How much time during the day do you do simple resting or relaxing?  This can solve so many problems with mental health just carving out time each day to just do nothing like watch a TV show, or meditate or even kind of just lay down on the couch and hang out.  It's best to only trust experts and your own intuition when it comes to healing some problems are too difficult for others to comprehend.  Most importantly do things that help you calm down and move your brain away from negative thought patterns.  I find nearly all of my negative thoughts are just me generating them based on things select people have said and done or just my mind forming this invisible wall for no good reason.  It's important to step back and be really thoughtful of all the possible reasons why things have been tough.  You'll find a number of them surprisingly didn't depend directly on you.

"My (19M) body type is a variant of the mesomorph body type and I absolutely despise it. That is mostly because whenever I look into a mirror, it seems that I look like a bloated baloon with arms and legs.

Before you say that I am obese, My BMI is 20.8, plus I work out and track my calories daily. Despite that, I still cannot accept my body, due to always appearing fat no matter what clothing I wear. Like, I would often pick out an outfit, only to look like a sausage stuffed in clothing.

What I wouldn't give to have a body type similar to ectomorph. Hell, to me, only men with a variant of ectomorph body type can look good in any clothing. Unfortunately for me, plastic surgery, or other ways to change ones body type aren't available at this time. Hell, I often think myself about forcefully cutting off that extra mass or bone just to change my type.

Now, whenever I see a man with something similar to the ectomorph body type, I can't help but feel extreme jelaousy and a desire to ""steal that body from them"".

At the deepest and possibly most abstract level, it's all about *abundance* vs *scarcity*. You correctly identify that you have lived in scarcity all your life, while to make friends be social, chatty etc you have to engage your *abundant* mode, which is quite underdeveloped - due to your circumstances.

"Yeah it's tough when you feel like you don't have time for hobbies or talking to new people (frivolous chats?), because in my experience it's the best way to make friends.

I've made new friends in new places by going to the same yoga class weekly, joining a social netball team, and going to events related to work/hobbies. I've never made a friend at a pub or bar randomly.

"Hey,  idk how to do this. I used to be a pretty cheerful and even tho shy guy, anxiety wasnt a great part of my life. 3 years ago i broke up with the greatest girlfriend i had ever had, i still seem to ""love her"" (my mind tries to convince me that i still do but i know its just me not lettting go of the feeling of being with her). I broke up with her because of this uneasy feeling i got, which i later realised was anxiety, feared her realising that she deserves more. Plot twist, she moved on and still thinks of me as a great guy. 2 years ago i finished UNI and started working as a nurse, even if stressful and at times i dont even have the energy to leave the house and socialize. I was never big on that, never initiated it except on dates, and with one friend i used to go on bike tours, not anymore, since he seems busy and cancelled the last 3-4 times. Now  al l i got is my sister, which drags me out the house at times, another friend mentally worse than i am, his life purpose is work and seeing him, talking to him makes me feel even worse.This year i started  going out more and socializing,  even went partying once and stayed out till 6 AM. Last time i was partying i had a sever panick attack andfeared even leaving my home. I even offered to go clubbing with those friends but none of em wrote back and i saw them posting a story on IG which dragged me a bit down, i dont wanna be a doomer and  hate on them.

I know you said therapy scares you but listen to podcasts, read books, get an anxiety workbook. Also medication helped me drastically with my anxiety. It helped take the edge off so I have the energy to tackle my struggles.

"My uncle was my best friend growing up. When I was 19, he killed himself.  He tried all the things society told him to do. He tried therapy, but the approaches never resonated with him.  

This motivated me to get a PhD in Neuroscience (ex-Stanford). My research was focused on understanding why some people like my uncle couldn’t let go of their childhood and would ultimately descend into mental illness and to suicide

8 years ago, a cousin I grew up with, also killed himself. A couple days prior he left me a voicemail, which in retrospect, I realized it was a cry for help. To my deep regret, by the time I got back to him, it was too late. 

On the day of my cousin’s funeral, in a wild coincidence, a group of people marched by on the street raising awareness around the suicide rate. They didn’t know my cousin, and I didn’t know anyone in that group. But we all knew, society isn’t doing enough to address the suicide crisis. 

I was disappointed – that even though we were doing so much to uncover the causes of mood illness – we were doing so little work to scale up its solutions. 

So I left academia and became a founding team member of the app mental heath app Calm. I knew that meditation could be an impactful way to help with people’s mental health. And meditation apps like Calm have had a huge, positive impact. 

But despite their growth and success, apps like Calm have largely failed to resonate with men.  The problem is that men make up 80% of all suicides. If we can’t get through to them we will never bring the suicide rate down. 

People in this space, however, continue to build new apps that are either explicitly or implicitly for women.  And basically everyone assumes that there is a one-size fits all solution for mental health. Go to therapy. Be vulnerable. Share your feelings. Eat your vegetables. 

But male culture around mental health is very different from women’s. If we want to actually help men, we need to not only start **accepting** these differences but we need to start **innovating** on solutions to help men.   

So I started a new app called Mental (www.getmental.com), along with Calm’s founding engineer and a clinician/prof who is focused on men’s mental health. Mental is geared to meet men where they are at. Funny and irreverent. Our focus isn’t on emotional vulnerability. Talk therapy is not required. Instead we are providing science-based tools and action-oriented frameworks that help men strengthen their mindset and live a life of energy, discipline and purpose.  

The app has short science-based daily audio (microdoses on mindset!); action-based protocols for updating your lifestyle to fit modern times; and, coming soon, AI coaching so that you can plow through roadblocks on your own in private.  We are heavily committed to innovating on new ways to help men live fuller lives.

If you want to check it out the first version of our app (lots more coming!), go [here](https://getmental.page.link/download). 

Please note - the app has a free trial but that leads to a paid subscription.  The only way we are going to scale up to reach a lot of men is by advertising (which costs money).  Nonprofits move slow and are generally low impact.  I asked the moderators of this subreddit about sharing Mental given that it is paid (don’t want to spam you all) and they gave me approval to post given its relevance."	ansonwhitmer	post	29.942584996918573	female	White	0.010600149631500244	na	na	na	3	malementalhealth

I (20M) have for the past 2 months been seeing a CBT therapists after struggling with mental health and depression for the last 3 years. A point that irked me was that I never could pinpoint the cause of my mental deterioration, so I assumed that my condition was just a result of an accumalation of bad experiences and circumstances in my later life. I have one week of therapy left until i am given the choice to end/contine/intensify therapy, and Ive lately been disheartened by how little they have helped. Something I never discussed with my therapist was that I believe I was sexually assaulted at age 6 by my cousin (11F) back in my home country. As far as I know, no one knows beside me and her, and she seperated from the family a while back as her mother divorced. If they did know, they may have chosen to never tell me in the hope I was too young to remember the event. The memory is so hazy that at times I question if it ever occured. Even then, I like to think of it of had having no effect on my life, but recently the memory has been surfacing more. Ive never looked back on this memory and thought of it as trauma, I have no feelings for the memory at all. But can something that I regarded as so insignificant result in symptoms many years later, or am I merely grasping at any clue to the cause for my depression. I feel sick when thinking of bringing it up to my therapist, Ive never told anyone but a very close friend of it. How vital would this piece of info be to my therapist?	bvgfnab	post	45.2112161000055	female	White	0.9978731870651245	na	na	na	6	malementalhealth
Hey friend, I'm not going to tell anyone what they should or should not bring up at therapy as that's between you and your therapist, but speaking as someone that's been doing both group and CBT for going on 3 years now I'll simply leave you with this. I've personally had multiple things come up over the duration of my numerous sessions that were deeply buried within my subconscious and I've had things come up that I never before thought about as being traumatic in nature until I voiced them out and made it known. I reiterate it's between you and your therapist, but urge you to consider the opportunity you have in the now in contrast to your however many remaining sessions.	bvgfnab	reply	na	na	na	0.9978731870651245	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"It can be this, it can be something else, it can be both...

The most important thing is that you should share it to your therapist, not to find the cause of your depression but to be sure to explore all your struggle. It may help you for something else than depression...

you know you want to talk about it, but you dont know how to say it. That's why you say it there, to test it, to have a starting point...

Like other one say, I have some personal event in my life that it affect me and I dont realise how heavy until I speak about it.

Play it honest, go the full way with your therapist. If you dont like the result, you can do what you want after..."	bvgfnab	reply	na	na	na	0.9978731870651245	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"I've been through something very similar. (childhood sexual assault from a female babysitter)

There's no right or wrong answer. It's messed me up in it's own way, and I found talking about it allowed me to address some of the negative aspects I felt about it. 

Discussing it with your therapist is not likely to cause you further harm, but may allow you to process your feelings about it.  If thinking about discussing it makes you feel sick, then it seems more likely that you aren't neutral about the event, but numb. If that's the case, there possibly is stuff that's worth addressing for your own well being.

But, _no matter what you choose_, you aren't wrong. Be gentle with yourself. Offer yourself kindness and please please remember

"I mean is there a downside to bringing it up, even if it isn't the one root cause? Depression could be caused of a combination of things and that may just be a part of the puzzle. I can't tell you what to do but I think writing down what you would possibly say to the therapist on a piece of paper and reading it back to yourself may help. At least you'd have a ""script"" or a letter to give them instead if saying it out loud if you do choose to bring it up. 

Therapists are educated to help you process this stuff in a healthy, safe environment. I can't tell you what to do, but I don't think it would be bad to bring it up. Good luck to you, and I'm so sorry your went through that."	bvgfnab	reply	na	na	na	0.9978731870651245	no	no	strong	na	malementalhealth
"Also remember just because you have a therapist doesn't mean they are the right therapist for you. You can and should  find a new one you don't mesh well with and feel like you can talk to and open up to and have the support you need from your current one. 

It took me years of being in and out of therapy before I realized that I could do that. It's not just about being in therapy but finding the right therapist for you and once you do it's so much easier. 

Looking into one that does DBT and works specifically with trauma is especially helpful for recovering from trauma and sexual abuse.  It wasn't until I found one like that that said it's ok if you have intrusive thoughts and emotions you can't change. That those intrusive things don't define me and it's ok to feel them. So we focused on learning to manage them and find better coping mechanisms rather than the cbt based change the way you think will change the way you feel model of therapy. 

DBT is basically the Buddhist principle of mindfulness applied specifically to our emotions and the idea that it's ok to not be ok.  

If you feel comfortable bringing this issue up with your therapist, then do. It's obviously important. And how your therapist reacts will likely tell you everything you need to know about whether you want to continue working with them. 

Regardless of how old you were or what you have trouble remembering, sexual assault is  a terrible experience that no one should have to go through, especially a child."	bvgfnab	reply	na	na	na	0.9978731870651245	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
The other day I was contemplating something Dr. Jordan Peterson said (paraphrased): A hero should be a monster in control of himself. I was contemplating how that related to me if at all. Am I a monster in control? As I fell down the rabbit hole of self analysis I came to the conclusion that indeed I am a monster in control. The final formulation of my answer to that question is thus: The only thing preventing me from being a single handed destroyer of a significant portion of the world’s population is my good nature. That I haven’t destroyed anything as a monster would, is confirmation that I am in control… my good nature stands guard over the monster. I am certain there are many men who are just as capable but good natured as I. Are you a monster in control of yourself?

"Jordan Peterson is really good at making meaningless word salads and having his followers make their own interpretations.

He is a Jungian psychologist... or at least was. He has just gone so far off the rails of jungian psychology. This idea that a hero is a monster under control is stupid for a couple of reasons...

1 - It's based on the Jungian hero archetype, which is one of four archetypes.

2 - Jungian psychology has value, but is heavily flawed. Nazis especially loved the esoteric nature of it as a way to promote the divine superiority of Aryans. Carl Jung himself also initially liked the Nazis (but later changed his mind for obvious reasons)

3 - Are firefighters monsters? Are EMT's monsters? Are doctors and surgeons monsters?

It doesn’t mean you should give up though, because there’s always a peak after a fall.

"This sounds like a serious situation...

I get that videogames make your brain go quiet for a while and distract you. If you can: try to turn that time into something energetic, drawing how you feel even if it's scribbles or all black pages in some note book. Try to express what's and explore what's truly on your mind, without preemptive influence of you thinking badly of yourself or faulting others. Just feeling.

Video games on the other hand can be used to form some friendships if you can find hold in some small niche videogame community. That could be your first step to see how to be social again.

But for real: if you do feel bad and want to see things change: call the numbers designed to help people just like you.

"I am not a psychologist or psychotherapist, so I am not qualified to give you a diagnose, however I think your behavior shows a pretty clear avoidant pattern.

You are avoiding going to school/leaving the house. Most likely there are emotions you are connecting with the locations you are planning to go to and that is why you have anxienty-like symptoms when getting ready. You are probably anticipating getting in situations that trigger you emotionally when going out of the house, be it with people at school or outside or even your parents when you return. The pressure is great enough for you to get into an avoidance pattern and not go to school.

This is actually quite serious and I heavily recommend you speaking to a professional about this if you can. If you are not taking care of it in time you might create a situation that heavily impacts your future life. As a first step I would try to get in contact with a professional and really thinkg about the emotions you are anticipating and why you do feel like that.

"I'm so sorry this is happening to you. You aren't the only one, which isn't to diminish your problem but to assure you that you aren't alone. Get professional help, if you can, even if that's just an online therapy service like Better Health. Something is better than nothing.

For now, a lot of what's going to make you feel better is going to seem counterintuitive. It's going to be stuff that doesn't make you feel good in the moment. It's like how they say people who try to make their lives easier in the moment (like by not exercising) end up making their lives harder in the long run. You're stuck in a cycle of short term needs and feelings. First, play less video games. Maybe even swear them off. That's coming from someone who loves video games, but you need to be able to engage with them responsibly. They can be an emotion sucking, time wasting endeavor if the rest of your life isn't feeling full. Video games should be a supplement for the rest of your life, never the one thing that brings you joy. Too many people rely on video games to be their sole source of satisfaction and fulfillment, which they can feel like at times but are no substitute for engaging with the world around you and putting yourself in situations where you might make friends.

Fill your newfound time with physical activities at home or outside that do not involve a screen. Draw, shoot hoops, go to a forest, read a book, anything you have access to that gets you touching and smelling and interacting with the world around you. The hardest part about breaking out of a depression is realizing that making choices, any choices, are the key (unless it is clinical and chemical). Your challenge will be making choices that don't allow you to fall back into your old habits of playing video games. Right now for you, playing video games isn't a choice, it's your default. It's a non choice. It's going to be hard. You have to want it. I'm really proud of you for almost making it out of the house. That's a huge moment. Keep it up. Get a little farther every time. Make one more choice each time  you do it. This time, make the choice to go out onto your front lawn before you go back inside. Maybe check the mail. It's okay to keep it small, but keep the small choices compounding on each other.

Lastly, be kind to yourself. Nobody else has to understand you as long as you understand yourself."	emocowboy1	reply	na	na	na	0.9990826845169067	strong	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"So I’m 23, about 260-270 lbs (been a while since I last checked), and have a lot of stretch marks. Mostly on my stomach, under my breasts, my sides/hips, upper arms, pelvis, etc. I think it’s mostly due to the way I overeat when I do overeat, where I’ll go through periods (a few days or so) of overeating then feel ashamed and try to fix it just to relapse every so often. I try to work out once in while, not as much as I should. I’ve been drinking a lot more water recently because I read that it helps (and, y’know, it’s good for me and all that)

Obviously this has really affected my mental health and self-esteem, I seem to obsess over it every other time I get in the shower just looking at them. I feel ashamed of it, especially since stretch marks are forever and it feels like I’ve already ruined my body so early into my life. I can’t imagine being able to go shirtless ever again. Most of the articles I’ve tried to look up for advice/body-positivity related to stretch marks are for women, which is great for them of course but doesn’t help me really. I’m looking for anyone with similar problems and how they deal/dealt with them, and just general advice related to dealing with them mentally and preventing them from getting worse."

"Hi, I think I can say I understand.

I'm soon 30, but between age 16-22 i had a roller coaster with my weight. I can relate to the overeating, not feeling that your hunger is sated, and the regret that follows. 

I went from around 175 lbs to 270 in a very short time, three times during that six year period. The weight gain gave me a lot of stretchmarks, I've got them on my belly, my hips, on my arms, side torso and my loins and thighs, etc.

For me, it helped with acceptance for my whole body, not just stretch marks per se. I don't even think negatively about the stretchmarks today when I look at myself. They can be viewed as any other scar. Sometimes they work as a reminder that I actively have to think about my choices when it comes to food portions/what I buy.

For them to not get worse, you just don't want your skin to stretch too much too fast so its related to how much you gain over time.

Today I weigh around 200 lb, and haven't worked out in a while. When I learned thay weight loss is 90% about what you eat rather than how much you go to the gym it got a lot easier, I just counted calories every day, had a calorie limit and stuck with it until I was satisfied. I'm not perfect though I still have episodes (can last days or weeks) where I overeat and feel regret, but I try not to beat myself up for it, I'm only human.

But just like most things in life, it gets easier with time and personally the older I get the less fucks I give about what other people think of my body, even it it doesn't help your situation I just wanted to lift that.

You're definately not alone, i have male friends with stretchmarks, you'll even see them on a lot of dudes, but we never talk about it. When someone says stretch marks, everyone thinks ""pregnant woman"", and it is then viewed as a ""feminine"" problem, hence the silence from men who don't want to appear feminine, but that's not how it should be!

"I have always swore against datingapps after seeing other men and myself being emotionally burned there. It's just brutal and especially if you're on the spectrum like me.

 ((ADD)i'm considered autistic but in my case i actually crave friendships and relationships and i'm also an HSP which really can be a double edged sword as i feel other's emotions aswell)  So i gave up and just focused on meeting women irl via friends and hobbies, as a Musician i am part of 2 music ensembles. 
But only 1 of those has women around my age (i'm 22) but as time went by and getting to know them and being friends i know just none of these girls have any romantic interest towards me (which is okay i'd never force anyone to love me as i want it to be genuine) besides those ensembles i only have 2 good friends and i know their friends kinda well, but there are also no real romantic possibilities so i feel kinda stuck...

 when i'm alone at home i feel really depressed about this and i start to believe there might be something wrong with me as no woman ever concidered me in a romantic way, so i don't really have irl (options) anymore and there where moments i just tried to deal with the fact i'm going to die alone, because i refuse to use datingapps as they are emotionally damaging... 
but then i saw an ad about a datingapp for neurodivergent people i though that might be worth a try to meet new women, and that there might be less shallow women (people in general)  then neurotypical as on regular apps.

 I just don't know anymore i want a soulmate who is monogamous (rare these days) and share our lives with who i can explore our hobbies and interests while being cuddly and romantic. But i feel no woman sees me in that way and honestly i feel like i'm out of options and just deal with the fact i won't ever get that while everyone i know can get someone if they really wanted or are in a relationship already... i know no way out and some advice is welcome 🍀🫂"	Mista_Brassmann34	post	20.6951976457933	female	White	0.9964118599891663	na	na	na	2	malementalhealth
"Dating apps are not all doom and gloom. They require am adjusted approach, somewhat detatched but still happy to get personal. And they requiresome good ""self marketing"" skills. So yea I do understand that sentiment of not wanting to attempt them. And don't if you expect some fast solution.

All I can say is: explore more interests, you already have the basis of knowing how to get out, so if you do thaymt, try out some completely new thing, maybe you meet more groups of people. Don't think all doom and gloom, loneliness is an awful feeling I know that, trust me. But life has plenty to offer outside of that, and as long as you can explore those on your own, people will see you come by, and so will you, and eventually people will stick around you for long. And see something in you the others don't."	Mista_Brassmann34	reply	na	na	na	0.9964118599891663	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"I don't have much actionable advice to offer you but just wanted to share some love and whatever words I do have.

I'm autistic and managed to get into a couple of relationships and am currently in one. Obviously every autistic/neurodivergent person is different, but don't give up hope on that front. There are people out there who find our quirks endearing and sincere, and probably bring their own quirks which you'll be able to understand. So don't totally give up and write yourself off. So much of dating and relationships is about random factors such as timing and place; no point writing yourself off when those factors might be the issue. Be kind to yourself and be the best that you can be for your own health and wellbeing in the meanwhile.

As for the situation of focusing on music. Sorry that nobody there really gelled with you! It happens. But it sucks. Like that you're mature enough recognise it isn't naturally happening and don't want to force it. I just want to point out though, that you don't miss the obvious when it does happen. Dunno about you, but I'm dumb as rocks when I'm being flirted with. As time goes on, you'll enter more and more spaces so I'm sure you'll have more opportunities.

You're still young. I totally get the worries and the feelings of loneliness, and they're not necessary unhealthy, but you also can't let yourself get into too damaging a funk about it. It's incredibly easy to feel the vibes off of someone who hasn't got things going his way but is still mature and self-confident vs a guy who doesn't have things going his way and is bitter or defeated by it. Obviously, 'be self-confident' is easy advice to give, but you're still young, barely experienced much of what the world has to offer, haven't really been in many spaces where things might naturally form, still young enough that people are figuring things out, etc etc. To clarify: I'm not saying just wait and things will magically work out, but I am saying that you'll be in different spaces as time goes on and I think being in a healthy mindset ensures you're ready if you meet someone who might be a potential partner.

I'm going to gently push back on the idea that monogamy is rare. I feel that it's fairly common, if not, still the 'norm'. And there are plenty of people out there who want a partner to just share their hobbies with while also be close and romantic with. It may not feel like that, but multiple different relationships exist, and the one you're identifying isn't particularly rare imo. But you do have to find the right people for that, and I get the impression that they might not be the type to be loud and vocal about it.

Sorry for the lack of actionable advice but just try and take care of yourself. Be confident in who you are, always strive to be a better person, and that alone will help with you being ready for when there might be someone in mind. Don't be afraid to put yourself just a little bit out there when given the opportunity (in a way that's not harmful to your health ofcourse) and you'll have more chances to meet people. Honestly, so much of it is down to chance, that I really can't stress enough the importance of finding happiness and learning to love yourself in the meanwhile. That stuff is radiant and, if you're highly sensitive to this stuff, you'll know how infectious and intoxicating people who are kind yet confident are. You don't have to be them, but you can find your own and have others enjoy your presence and eventually attract the right people."

"Hopefully this is a safe space but. 

I’ve got a few diagnosed mental illnesses blah blah blah. Enough on the bad. Imagine a car salesman with social anxiety, and some chronic depression mixed in there. Yesterday I sold two cars in the same day (rare for me) and the deals were phenomenal. If the month keeps up I’ll be making about 40k in gross (that’s about a five thousand dollar check for me and I’ve never made that much. ). And I’ve never had the confidence to go into a guest’s interaction and close them like that. 

ONTOP of that, I used to literally call my friend in HS And talk about how I haven’t a single good quality about myself, genetically or spiritually. I hated my looks. Well, this week on three separate occasions I was approached by three different women around my age blatantly flirting with me around my bosses. Even my co workers were laughing and joking. These women literally turned heads when they walked through. And tbh I was just doing my job. I was honestly a nervous wreck but I played it cool on both scenarios. They ended up laughing and jokingly cursing like we’d be friends by the time they left (two separate occasions). 

Two dates in a week is insane for me because tbh, I thought I was a little ugly. All I did was imitate confidence. The dates didn’t go so well because tbh, I was nervous and I am not a people person. But, the fact I even got that far is amazing me rn. 

I can confidently say I don’t hate myself. I might hate my circumstance. That change is enough for me to push forward. My next stop is 100k a year and a sizeable friend group I can trust."	Accomplished_Way_693	post	19.700826376396513	male	White	0.001603179145604372	na	na	na	5	malementalhealth

As it says in the title, I do not want to die. I am afraid of death, and could never bring it upon myself even if I wanted to. But I do not feel a reason that I should be alive. I do not have anything to look forward to when I wake up, and nothing to think about that puts me to sleep. I feel total depression during every waking hour of every single day. I felt it on Christmas, I felt it on my last birthday, and I'm certain I'll feel it on this one too. Nothing feels like it matters. If I disappeared, I cannot honestly name a single living being who would care. And I mean actually care. Care as in they'd reminisce on their time with me, and have good memories of me and things we did together. I have nobody like that. My life holds no bearing on anyone else. I am completely expendable and have been replaced so many times that I genuinely just come to expect it at this point. I don't cry when I think about any of this anymore, because it has been my life for I'd say about a year and a half now. I would give up every single material possession I have if I felt as if I had one person who genuinely loved me. Yesterday the person I love, who claims to love me as well, kissed 3 other people. And sure, I'm 15, it's not important, I'll get over it. But they were it. That was all I had. My friends bailed on going out with me, and I found them in the exact same place at the same time, with someone else. I was supposed to go to the mall with another friend and his partner, and they just never said anything after they invited me. Never told me a plan, never told me a place, nothing. And they went today. I don't know what to do. I am afraid that one day, I will stop being afraid to die, and that I will kill myself.	throwaway3278941	post	22.37713314471359	male	White	0.9987941980361938	na	na	na	4	malementalhealth
Hi, I'm sorry you got cheated on, but you already beat me to the punch. You're 15, life kinda just sucks like this sometimes, but I know it won't be the end of the world, it hurts but I know you can move past it and I don't think I need to tell you you should probably break up with that person. But let's shift the topic real quick, do you have any hobbies, anything you prefer doing even if you're miserable doing it? Sometimes finding good friends means finding something you share; interests, hobbies, sports, anything.	throwaway3278941	reply	na	na	na	0.9987941980361938	strong	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"When I was 15, I had no friends. The people I sat with at lunch didn't actually speak to me once in two years. My small group of sort-of friends I'd had since childhood randomly started bullying me one day and forced me out of the group. To this day in my 30s, I still couldn't tell you why. The one girl I liked, when I asked her out, told me that she'd never want to be seen with someone like me.

When I was 17, I finally had a revelation. I was not the problem. THEY were. Everyone else who treated me like trash objectively sucked. There was absolutely nothing wrong with me, and they were all just massively stupid and fucked in the head. I was a funny, friendly person and they were all total pieces of shit with absolutely no redeeming qualities. 

By the time college rolled around, I suddenly found myself surrounded by friends, never had an issue with girls, and regularly hosted enormous parties with my buddies. It was like I was living someone else's life, and I was actually finally happy.

I think the ""everyone sucks but me"" attitude I'd developed as a shield had evolved into actual self confidence.

But the bottom line is, it absolutely gets way better. Even if you can't possibly conceive it now. Highschool and college are literally separate dimensions. Nothing socially about you in highschool follows you into college.

You need to spend the next 2-3 years figuring out what you love about yourself so you can mentally tell everyone else who can't see it too to get fucked.

 Figure out what made you hate yourself like this too. Because you are likely joining in and hating yourself on the behalf of others. Your high school class is not worth that.

"listen my man, as you pretty much mentioned yourself, you’re 15. you’ve only lived a very small percentage of what could be a really good life. 

i’ve been there man, everybody has. that whole love thing happens to everybody and everyone experiences an end to it. it could either be good, or bad. and in your case it was bad, but you’re not alone. 

i’m not trying to talk down to you cause i’m only 19, by no means am i a professional. but you and that partner you had are still very young and very much so experiencing life with each day. i don’t agree with how they treated you and they’ll soon get a reality check, and if it happened now it was going to happen eventually. so maybe it was better it happened sooner than later. these things are way way way more common in these youthful years just cause of how kids and teenagers are nowadays. if i were you i’d wait a while to try again. 

moving on is a terrible but necessary experience, it’s filled with painful ups and downs and there are moments when you think you’ve got everything sorted out but it all falls apart and you’re back at square one. what i learned is that the whole thing everyone says about “time heals” and “you’ll get over it eventually” is actually true. i seriously wish i had someone to hold my hand through the process but i didn’t, and i hope i can be that person to you. cause i sure as shit really needed that. i just want you to know it’s possible. i am living, breathing, proof. and there are others just like it. things really do get better, and the way i see it, i think of this type of thing as a badass character development moment where you finally mature and have an understanding of how life really works. 

if you need someone to talk more about this then i’m here man just send me a message. but as for everything else you mentioned, 

i have experienced the same exact thing you mentioned. wanting to die, but fearful of it. i know how overwhelming the feeling can be. this type of stuff is very delicate and it really depends on the underlying problem and factors around it that could be making it worse. you should really consider talking to a psychologist so that you get the help you really need. i’m scared of telling you something bc i don’t want you to interpret it the wrong way and i think you should be cautious of what other people say about this thing too. cause like i said before, it’s delicate. nobody could ever truly understand it, and you might not understand it yourself. 

i just want you to really consider what i started this comment off with, you’ve only lived a small percentage of what could be a very very good life. we all have shitty moments, and sometimes those moments could last a pretty long time. but just think about it man, are you really gonna give much of a shit about this person that cheated on you in 5 years? i bet you’ll be with someone better, someone who genuinely cares about you. i consider failed relationships preparation for that special someone. we learn a lot from these things, and sometimes you need to experience it in the worst way possible to fully understand that it’s not the final time, to understand that you’ll meet someone new and have a totally different experience with them. 

i hope you’re doing okay right now man, to be honest with you i only commented because i know how this type of shit can feel and i would’ve done anything to have that guidance for me."	throwaway3278941	reply	na	na	na	0.9987941980361938	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

I chased after things society told me what I wanted, and thus i felt empty chasing them, just bitter and angry when the things I chased made me unhappy.

The things I actually want aren't that grandiose or special (well to me they are, but others might not consider them so) so I thought it was wrong to want them. What's important is that they make me happy, and I'm probably only gonna live ~100 years anyway so i might as well say to hell with everyone else.

"All of the following reasons are why. Number 1: I don’t have any talents. I tried bass guitar and ukelele by to no avail. I’m still bad at them both after 5 years of playing. The hardest baseline it can play is “When I saw her there” by the Beatles. I went to a family friends house with our family, and the oldest daughter had started playing bass only months before, and she was leaps and bounds ahead of me. 
Number 2: My looks. My hair is a good place to start. I could never get it right, and whenever I go somewhere to cut it it’s always a mediocre job. I have always wanted the haircut of George Harrison in his music video of “Blow Away”. But I could never get it good enough. Never could I get my hair to ever look decent even once. And speaking of my looks, my face is ugly as fuck. I hate how I look, and it’s so bad it’s literally indescribable. I hate my face so much. 
Finally, number three. Math: I can’t do any math at all. I am just stupid, and my brain just doesn’t work. In school, I try and try and try but I always fail. This is often my motto of life,”Try, Try, Try again, and you will still fail.” I can’t get girls, and my only friends once said I was annoying and the most hated person in the classroom. I have no real friends that care for me. It’s constant insulting me for how I look, it’s constant calling me a “retard” and now I even call myself that. My nonexistent ego is in the negatives.

"Hey all.

I'm not really sure how to start this. I started to type up a huge intricate story about everything and have decided to forego that in favor of a simple scenario that can be fleshed out with questions.

Scenario:  Married for ten years, together for twelve. Raised 4 kids together (my twins and her two), possible physical infidelity (no proof), definite emotional cheating (entire marriage with ex-best friend - who is a POS cheating married man), lying, etc.  Divorced in June 2022 - finalized in September 2022.

Started dating a woman at the end of September.  Taller than me, more stable than me, better career path, treats me right, is annoying at times, and I am very much mentally attracted to her and enjoy our time together, however I am not sexually attracted to her (she has a high drive and mine is mostly dead due to heart health issues)

Ex-Wife has been fighting non-stop to reestablish trust, and is working hard to win me back - and I actually miss her and still love her........but I don't know if I can reopen the bridge she burnt.

&#x200B;

The advice I am asking for:  Should I give my ex-wife another shot, or do I stick with this woman who is more successful than I am and hope that sexual attraction grows?

Really stupid to ask on a reddit page but I really have no one to ask for advice.

Lots of videos on the internet that talk about being a man by working constantly, making a ton of money, banging a ton of girls, etc. etc. but I'm not sure if that's truly the traditional definition.

In my formative years, ""being a man"" was more about being respected and respectful, being capable, listening and learning, standing up for your beliefs and welcoming differing points of view.

I think the ""elite"" are perverting masculine values to fit what they need. Most men strive to be masculine so it would be very easy to get men to do whatever their want by equating their goal to masculinity.

 In the beginning, like everyone else, I started questioning why I couldn't get a girlfriend. Although there have been women who have been attracted to me, I haven't been attracted to them, so I rejected them. Nowadays, whenever I see any of my friends enter a relationship, it's always the boyfriend who takes a dominant role and invests more time and money in maintaining the relationship. Women mostly look for men of their age or older because they can provide more, and honestly, I refuse. I refuse outright. I refuse to be in the typical relationship where I am obligated to take a dominant role and invest a lot of time and money in a woman who will not give me anything relevant beyond sex and little else. Romantic relationships are a business where they win, and I refuse to go through that. I am totally fine being alone, and I don't see the point in getting into something where I lose out.

"Being content with being on your own is a wonderful accomplishment. I spent years living alone and I loved them, but then love came crashing in my life unexpectedly. It was something I never knew I wanted, and was totally different than what I thought I had wanted. It was a humbling experience. A profound life-example of “you don’t know what you don’t know.”

This last perspective of the ‘bitter caretaker trope’ if held for too long, will cause you to have  more resentment towards women. You should try and work yourself away from statements of absolutes, and not put all women or all relationship dynamics into a box. Relationships are unique. Not saying there are no similarities between two relationships, but each relationship has its own dynamic, and ebb & flow. 

Another thing I will say is that you are within your rights to demand an ‘unconventional relationship’, if that opportunity ever came. A relationship between two people is similar to a social contract: you have your costs of admission, they have theirs. You have your desires, they have theirs. You have your capabilities, they have theirs. When you love someone, you will be more apt to negotiate and find a healthy balance between the two."

"Interestingly, this is what I was thinking this morning. Even my second ex called it a ""partnership"" and whenever I think of ""partners"" I think of either 1) cowboys lol or 2) business partners.   


The etymology of the word in summation ""When combined, ""partner"" and ""-ship"" create ""partnership,"" signifying the state or condition of being partners or sharing responsibilities, profits, and losses in a venture or endeavor."" So you aren't wrong to think that ""romantic relationships are a business where they win"" [https://www.etymonline.com/word/partnership#etymonline\_v\_35757](https://www.etymonline.com/word/partnership#etymonline_v_35757)

"Your reasoning is sound and it's not a bad decision you are pondering.  You are recognizing 2 things I've discovered about myself that mean my odds are low.  And ok, they can be low, but here are the reasons:

1. I lack experience

2. I desire people who are more attractive than I am.  i.e. could I have someone who I feel is less attractive in theory?  Yes but I wouldn't be attracted to them and it wouldn't work.

3. Everything you wrote above.  Relationships do not come without a significant investment in your time.  I'm willing to put in the time if I find a person I feel good with but only if it makes sense and I'm really into them.

So honestly I agree if you are considering the single life as a solid solution to avoid the pitfalls of trying.  Maybe do one thing, put yourself out there in somewhat of a limited capacity.  In another words you are ""open to a relationship"" instead of it being a ""must have"".  So you can still from time to time try but just fall back on hey, Im still cool being single.  This is sort of the approach I'm taking.  I think there are probably a growing number of men who this will be the most sensible approach keeping your mental well being in check.

I used to enjoy playing video games, now it just ends in me being angry. I used to enjoy play basketball, now  I'm a lot worse than I used to be and lose to friends who I used to beat or be as good as. I used to enjoy hanging out with friends and family but now they all annoy me and I just wait to go home. But when I'm home I don't do anything that makes me happy, I'm in school so I just do assignments in a major I don't care about, I always tell myself that its just a couple months until summer break when I can relax or do something different but it is always underwhelming like working at some shitty job then its back to school. How do you guys keep going when you just have no more hope. I'm not going to kill myself but dying in a car accident or some freak accident wouldn't be terrible.

"Hey man, i had and have periodically same thoughts as you.

Im 22 year old.

I know that feeling everything feels blank, old friends are not there or bacame boring, school is just waste of time, video games aren t fun anymore...
When you finish school you will work job and live paycheck to paycheck...
But it is better than to be in school, atleast job pays you with money.
As for video games, try to put them down for some time.
Also, i would recommend you to start doing calisthenics, ideally when the spring and summer are nearby.
Also, find some new  hobby, it can be anything what you have interest in.

And finally, im in same shoes even now, relationship helped me but we broke up, and im again depressed and don t see meaning behind all this.
And same I have been thinking lately about capitalism, wage slaving, this brutal world... And concluded that I won t probably have kids in future.

"While teaching in the United States in the 1960s, a renowned Zen master named Shunryu Suzuki invited a group of his students to join him in a tea ceremony. The students arrived, eager to learn from their master. As they were waiting, they noticed that Suzuki was carefully washing each teacup, pouring hot water into them, and then dumping the water out. He repeated this process several times, with great care and attention to detail.

After several minutes of this, one of the students couldn’t contain his impatience. ""Master,"" he asked, ""when are you going to start teaching us? We already know how to drink tea!""

Suzuki smiled gently and replied, ""Ah, but you do not know how to drink tea. You only think you do. In order to truly experience the tea, you must first empty your cup. You must approach it with a beginner's mind, as if you have never tasted tea before.""

What did he mean? Over the course of our lives, we go through experiences, we develop beliefs and we build up knowledge that helps us to try and make sense of the world. An unfortunate side effect of this is that knowledge limits our ability to perceive the true world - because we think we know the answer already. As Shunryu Suzuki said, “In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are few.”

Beginner’s mind is a fundamental concept that encourages us to approach each moment with an open, non-judgmental, and curious attitude, as if we were experiencing it for the very first time. This mindset helps us let go of preconceived notions, assumptions, and biases, and allows us to fully immerse ourselves in the present moment.

Its not difficult to imagine what beginners mind is like because you used to have one - its a child’s mind. Children are naturally curious, playful, and full of wonder. They see the world with fresh eyes and an open heart, without judgement or expectation. They are not afraid to make mistakes or ask questions, and they approach each experience with enthusiasm and joy.

So if your mind was like a smartphone then resetting it would bring you back to when it was first switched on, when you were a child, when you were curious and full of wonder about the world. Wherever you are right now, you can pick up an object and look at it as if for the first time, noticing everything about it. Its weight, its texture, its smell. How it looks, whether it makes a sound when you shake it. And you can view the world the same way when you walk outside. You probably know someone that people would describe as happy go lucky - if you watch them this is what they do, they meet the world with an open mind, enthusiasm and without expectation.

That’s the essence of beginner’s mind. It’s about letting go of our adult self-consciousness and fear of failure, and embracing a child-like sense of wonder and curiosity. It’s about seeing the world as if we were experiencing it for the very first time, with an open and non-judgmental attitude.

So how do we cultivate beginner’s mind in our daily lives? Here are a few practical tips:

First, start with curiosity. Approach each experience with a sense of wonder and intrigue, as if you were seeing it for the first time. Ask questions, explore, and stay open to new possibilities.

Second, let go of preconceptions. Try not to judge or label things based on past experiences or expectations. Instead, stay present and open to the experience as it unfolds.

Third, embrace the unknown. Instead of fearing the unfamiliar, embrace it as an opportunity to learn and grow. Approach each new experience with a sense of adventure and excitement, like a child exploring a new playground.

Finally, practice meditation. Meditation is a powerful tool for cultivating beginner’s mind. By focusing on the breath and letting go of thoughts and distractions, we can train our minds to stay present and open to new experiences.

Beginner’s mind is a powerful mindset that can help us stay present, open, and curious in our daily lives. By approaching each experience with a child-like sense of wonder and non-judgment, we can let go of preconceptions and embrace the unknown. So, go ahead, try something new today, and approach it with a beginner’s mind. You never know what you might discover!

">I’m no thug or dark triad guy

No idea what this means, so already assume you're getting advice or ideas from weird spaces. But anyway...

>Then I’ll be off to working. 

Work itself can be a space to meet people. Obviously you don't want to mix work and pleasure up, but you can meet people and get to know them. Change jobs here and there, and you don't have to worry as much about workplace relationship issues. Plenty of women exist in workplaces who also would like to meet men too. Obviously different spaces result in different gender demographics, but you get the point. Even if you only go to work, you might still be able to meet people.

>Hobbies bore me

Really? You have 0 interests? Nothing you could talk about? Nothing that you get up to outside of work and study? Eat, sleep, work, repeat? Assuming this is all true, then I have to ask who you are? What's your identity? What do you stand for? Etc etc. And if you're underselling yourself, then you know gaming can be considered a hobby? Reading, or learning how to rephrase things like D&D being a ""social activities with friends, or whatever.

But if you genuinely don't do anything, then yeah it's going to be hard. People want to date people who interest them. And they are people interested in all sorts of stuff, but my being interested in anything means you're probably not interesting at all.

>bars are not my thing and generally, as an average guy, there are too many rules

Dont do bars then. And society/life has lots of rules. If you don't want to learn the rules that govern society, that's fine, but yeah you are in the boat of struggling to find someone then.

"you're good bud. There's a stunning, absurdly huge variety of people out there. Many many different types of women. You don't need to be a bad boy. You don't need to be a bar guy.

&#x200B;

I'd start here - get really, really fucking healthy. Work out, diet, sleep, meditate, stretch, hydrate. Almost definitely, this will make you happier, smarter, more relaxed, and better at connecting with people. You'll probably do better at work. Stick with it for a while, a lot of the benefits of these practices don't show themselves until a month or more. 

&#x200B;

From there - start connecting with people! And things. You don't need to have a hobby to have a girlfriend. but just get out there and connect with yr life. Just think about how chock full the world is of incredible things you haven't seen yet. It's so easy to feel like, at 28, you've seen it all, and know what people are like, but there's an astronomical amount of people and places out there. out of all 7 billion people out there, there aren't at least a handful you'd connect with, if not tens of thousands.

I would also (and i know this is hard) let go of the idea that you need to be a certain thing. I'm a skinny, average height, balding, soft af dude.

"
Before I start off, I just want to say that I’ve always been comfortable in my own skin and practiced self-love for my whole life. But this situation really has me rethinking my values.
I don’t tend to get jealous that often, but my ex (f25) recently dumped me and I think it’s due to the fact that I can’t support her obsession with her celebrity crushes. I understand that many people may say “it’s not like she’ll ever have the opportunity to do something with them” but I feel like fan-girling is definitely a red flag based on my experience during the relationship. And I’m talking about die-hard girls that spend every last penny on merch and small trinkets that would later collect dust in the closet. And here are some stories to help you guys gain a better understanding of what happened.

So from the beginning, it was apparent that she was a really big fan of Asian artists such as bts and keshi. And I’ve supported it by playing their music and talking about them with her. However, as time went by I noticed that her whole identity revolved around being a fan girl, this slightly irritated me as I did not receive the same attention in which they had from her. For instance, after attending a keshi concert which I actually enjoyed, she decided that a couple of weeks later, she would replace her phone wallpaper of me with a shirtless picture of keshi. I brought it up and told her that it made me feel uncomfortable and disrespected. But she did not see the issue. I may have been overthinking it, but it seemed like seeing the seductive half-naked man on her Lock Screen made her happy because that’s what she wanted to see every day. To me, it definitely touched upon my insecurities because in no way do I look like keshi besides the fact that I am Asian as well. So from then on, at the back of my head, I knew that she had a type for Asian men as her ex was also Asian.

Additionally, we tried to make an effort to at least meet up once a week, and I usually tried to plan something that we would both enjoy. She was stubborn but had no ideas, so I would present her with a variety of activities that we could do together just to spend quality time. This made planning dates a bit difficult but most times it was worth it for me because at least I got to spend time in her presence. But this one instance that disappointed me was when she canceled the plan a few hours prior because bts announced that they were going on a hiatus. I understand that it’s sad to see your favourite boy band split up and take a break, but it’s just sad that during that time she would’ve rather spent the time alone than go out with me (is this selfish?).

And on the topic of bts, one thing that I’ve always done was to sniff the heads of people closest to me because it’s a comforting thing for me. She’s always been turned off by it, but when jungkook did it to his bandmates, she would change her mind about that act. And goes for the type of jokes that celebrities would make. Where if I told a joke, she would cringe or say that it was a stupid joke that she didn’t find funny at all, but when a similar joke was mentioned by a celebrity, she would laugh and bring it up constantly. It felt as if I was pushed aside just because I wasn’t famous.
Also, as I said, I would support her obsession with the band by driving her places and getting her all the merch she wanted. But I found it odd how she would collect photo cards and frame pictures in her room, but she refused to take pictures with me, of me, or even let me take pictures of her, so we never really have any pictures with each other despite the significance of picture to her. So when she would show me her photo card collection, I was not impressed and she said “why can’t you just pretend to be happy because this is the stuff that makes me happy”. But don’t get me wrong, if the circumstances were different and we had pictures together, then maybe I would change my attitude toward the photo card. And it did not help that she would be comfortable with taking pictures with her friends and having pictures taken of her by her friends, but I wasn’t allowed to do the same. Moreover, we would always look for jewelry online for her and when I presented the idea of a name necklace with my name, she thought it was tacky and wouldn’t look good, however weeks later, she would go to hot topic and buy bts name necklaces, never were any of the necklaces that I bought her ever again.

I’ve tried talking to her about it in the past and asked for more attention and love. But all that did was push her away. When I needed love and closeness, she gave me space. When I was upset about something, she would be upset because I was upset, so I was the bad guy in the end. I tried to work on the problems we had as a team, but there was no change or compromise. I understand that everyone has their own different needs and your significant other should not be the one to burden all your problems, but it does not help when the person is adding salt to the wound. Maybe if things played out differently and I was able to receive the same attention as others or if I just shut my mouth, we would still be together, but I do not want any part in a toxic relationship.

After countless arguments once a month, I’ve decided to settle for the bare minimum such as good morning and Good night texts. Which was basically the only texts we’ve sent to each other and she couldn’t even do that. She has flopped on plans many times despite my efforts in trying to set dates up. And her excuse was that she’s really busy and doesn’t have time to check her phone. But when we would hang out, she would constantly have her phone out and never gave me the attention I wanted. I’ve mentioned this for the final time and she decided to end things between us through text.

And in no way am I hating on any of these artists. But I feel like I was never really a priority and I was not appreciated. I know I must move on and grow as a person. I’m not saying it’s wrong for someone in a relationship to have a celebrity crush, but when it gets in the way of the development of the relationship, then issues may occur. I know that the opportunity of meeting said celebrity crush is slim, but I feel like although there was no physical forms of cheating, emotional cheating is present even though the celebrity doesn’t even know of her existence. This is because heart truly belonged to the and the only thing stopping her is fact that the celebrity is unattainable. They say that celebrities are normal people as well and should be treated as so. So the question that arises for me is that if another guy comes along that resembled the celebrity, what would she do. I know I cannot stop someone from feeling how they feel and I cannot prevent things from happening. But I really tried to make her happy and she ended the relationship of just over a year. I admit that I’m at fault for feeling those types of ways and being “insecure” but it’s just really hard when the person you live with all your heart doesn’t feel the same and can find their happiness through their fantasies and idolizations of celebrities."	sung_wing	post	20.241854872884502	female	White	0.9882768988609314	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth
"I don’t think she would have liked you having half naked girls as your wallpaper. And had she not cared, it would have been proof that you had no reason to be together anyway. 

From what you wrote I’d say it wasn’t as much a passion as it was an obsession. Maybe some people would be okay with that. But I doubt there would be that many. 

I’m a woman and my best friend is fond of K-Pop, though not obsessed in any way. Through her I have met girls like your ex, and I know I shouldn’t generalize but I will. A lot of them are some type of crazy that when at its peak isn’t worth to deal with. 

You wrote that her ex was Asian, and that you are too. It fits perfectly with the stereotype, unfortunately. I don’t know if it’s too harsh of me to say, but I believe these girls fantasize (maybe even unconsciously) of being with an idol, and ordinary Asian men (= non idol) are the closest to their ideal without being exactly what they want. So they are frustrated and perpetually dissatisfied. 

I believe you would never have been enough, because in her eyes, no one is. Except those guys who live far away and don’t even know she exists. 

She didn’t need you to be more loving or caring, or more idol like. She needs to grow up, and no one but herself can do it. 

I’m sorry that you had to be caught in her immaturity, and to answer your question I would say that yes, you were insecure, but also it was so very justified ! Insecurity can be a very legitimate feeling. 

I hope you’ll be able to heal from that quickly, because though in most conflicts the fault isn’t one sided, so you certainly made mistakes, as anyone does, but from an external point of view her leaving you was the best she could do for you."	sung_wing	reply	na	na	na	0.9882768988609314	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"Hi there,

As we all know, mental health is extremely important and it affects many of us in different ways. However, men's mental health is often overlooked or stigmatized. That's why I'm posting this survey to learn more about men's mental health and to raise awareness. 

If you identify as a man, please take a few minutes to fill out this survey about your mental health. Your answers will help us understand the challenges that men face when it comes to mental health.

"We spend most of our times in our head, dont make it a toxic place to be, seems you think alot and have a short attention span, dont contemplate big decisions like this when in bed and tired it only adds fuel to fire, you won't be able to sleep and all of this hypothetical arguments in your mind is going to bring you down even more and make you insomnia 

Your attention is the most powerful thing, if you don't like something or someone, take away it's only power, your attention, literally think of why the sky is blue or why water is wet, I'd advice look into investing, how rich makes money for them or look into capitalism vs socialism and which could benefit society (jump into a rabbit hole that makes you think away from toxic state of mind)

I believe it's called ruminating, I sometimes will be working and just get soo angry and worked up about something my mother did, this would then make me irritated and not focus on my work and can lead to me being sacked, not a healthy place (mentally) to be when you are working under a sun all day

"So we have a few states that allow assisted suicide for terminally ill people. I don't know about the laws when it comes to mental illness though. I know there is, or at least was, a private group in Oregon that would help assist people with the proper knowledge to end their life. I'm wondering if anyone knows who that group is, or if they are even still around. Or if there are any other groups like that. 

There is nothing like that in my state so I would have to travel. But I've made the decision that I'm ready to go. There is no point in trying to talk me out of it. I've had many years to think about this. As is now my mental state is declining fast. There is no more help at this point.

"Alienation, the scourge of modernity. We all know of it. Depression and suicidality. Loss of belonging. Rage and hostility. Men specially live in a isolated social culture, where many feel ashamed of even having a mental health. 

What is my newfound insight? Are my thoughts valueable in a hierachy of norms? 
I just learned about Habermas, which is just a footnote of the actual topic I would like to adress, and he explain quite elegantly how mental illness, or psychopathology will increase in a modern society.
The likes of Jordan Peterson aim to cultivate and profit on the suffering of alienated and estranged men.

I do not claim any spiritual leaders to be a charlatan. The current debate climate gives validity to the most persistent and oppressed group. Uncharitable misintrepertations in dog-whistle decibels. These unindented consequences off the hyper connectivity that generation-z has grown accustomed to. We can barely keep off TickTock and it's addictive algorithms. We are the charlatans.

The disciples are up in arms on behalf of a ideology, by the slightest sight of slight directed towards their messiah. Be careful of gods, as they step on ants. Mentors should be ashamed off students who hold dear the fear of mere opposition. Opposition, or the dialectic is the forge of ideas. We live in a post-modern, post-ideology, post-time, post-moral; era. I argue that a huge segment off the disposed population do not even have language to communicate or explain their gripe. We need to disarm, cease flaming and agree to ceasefire. 


Stop calling yourself incells, stop looking at your dicksize, and do not begrudge the women who will never witness it's glory. It's okay to be angry, even I work on convincing myself my past have made me unique. I dare to say the ideas that uniqueness conjure can make your soul into a symbolic artifact.

This isn't actually sexual frustration. It's other feelings. 

For the sexual frustration: sex toys.

But it doesn't seem to be what's really bothering you, more hos you compare yourself to others. It doesn't make you a failure or wrong that you haven't had sex yet. That's pretty normal. And we don't know that much about other people's lives, when we are on the outside looking in. Everyone's got their issues and struggles.

Friends? Social circles? don't know any single women. There are NONE in my social groups. They're all married. Sure would be nice to know how I can meet and befriend them. Ofcouse if you try to even talk to a girl you don't know you're labeled a creep. Especially when you looks like a fuckin goblin man.

"I'm going to give you a different thing to think about than the others have.  

Our emotional reactions to things are choices we make.  We *decide* to ""feel"" certain ways about things.  

What that means is that you don't have to decide to feel shitty in reaction to external things, like  
>Woman does this and that - - > yes, you go girl strong and idependent woman! Slay queen etc  
>  
>Man does same - - - - > nothing, nobody to support him.  

Stop in over at r/mensupportmen in addition to posting here.  There's good stuff happening there.  And there's no ""fake cheering"" like you said to another person here.  Folks both here and over there are sincere about helping each other out.

You can decide to see rejection as being given the opportunity to learn that people you're initially interested in - because they're physically attractive, or they have a personality that catches your attention, or they move nicely or smell nice, or because they speak to your friendly and smile at you, or whatever reason - aren't the right people for you, because you two aren't a match, or the timing is wrong, or you have different values, or different goals, or different world views, or whatever...a million things.  And that's a good thing.  You don't want to be with or spend time and energy on someone who doesn't whole-heartedly want to be with you.  So women who reject you are doing you a favor, by showing you that they're not right for you, and by keeping you free to find the one(s) that are.

If you can find different ways to *think* about things, and people, and events, it will lead you to *feel* differently about them.

Remember, r/Menaregood/ , and keep a perspective on how *you're* a good man, and remember that it's perfectly fine to feel good about being a man instead of shitty about it.  You don't have to be all blown-up levels of proud, because arrogance isn't good, but you don't have to feel shitty.

I know several people who left jobs behind and started businesses in which they: - mow grass in spring and summer/rake leaves in fall/plow snow in winter - walk dogs - do basic janitorial services for businesses after they close: emptying trash cans, vacuum cleaning, cleaning bathrooms and break room kitchenettes, maybe wiping down some common-space surfaces, and maybe cleaning some windows - power-washing stuff for people like their driveways, houses, sidewalks, removing graffiti, cleaning off boats, etc. - I know a guy who started a business by buying a remote-control camera thing on a long cable and just checking places in people's property for whatever they want to check...main drain pipes looking for clogs or breaks, in walls or attics trying to find the source of strange sounds or water leak stains or mold growth. (Looks like they're called things like ""plumbing inspection cameras"", ""borescope cable cameras"", ""endoscope inspection cameras"", ""drain pipe cameras"", and other similar names.) He originally did nothing else to repair or mitigate what he finds, he just told and showed the clients exactly what and where their problem is so they can then get a plumber or pest control service or mold removal service or do home repairs. [Here's a short video on how they work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZMTkHR0eo). He has since added a drain cleaning pressure-nozzle hose, and if he sees a clog, he offers to try to clear it with water pressure before people call a full fledged plumber, gets a waiver signed, adds an extra fee, and runs a water hose down the pipe to see if some pressurized water will help.

Those are some suggestions that may help you find more money and some happiness.

If you eventually start a business of your own, there are also organizations out there to help self-employed people get or develop benefits packages for themselves that they might otherwise get through an employer, such as the National Association For the Self-Employed https://www.nase.org/   

Hang in there, man.  Time passes, and situations pass, and tough times don't last forever.  You can lead yourself to feeling better, and others are all around you who can and will help you.  

You many also want to think about getting a counselor or therapist, who will be someone who is 100% on your side and in your corner, and a professional at helping you improve your situation, your thinking, and your feelings."

"I agree with the other guy about not being on social media. But honestly,

You don't need a woman to be happy in life. I know society has told us men since birth that unless we're providing something for women (and others in general) we're worth nothing, or that you're a loser if you don't have a woman in your life romantically. But honestly that's all a lie that we have to unlearn. 

Your happiness is within you, you've just been lied to. If women don't make you happy and you've done all you can to be a good attractive person, move on, it's not your fault. Get involved with people and things that actually make you happy.

"You realize we are all just people on this planet, right?

Some women have a good social network of friends encouraging them. Some men do too.

Some women don't and some men don't. 

Even if you are a woman, it's not like you are automatically followed around by a chorus of people chanting ""you go, girl!"". Most single women have to get up, go to work, buy food, clean their apartment, go work out. Without anyone singing and dancing their praise. If you have people encouraging you in your life, it's because you've built up mutually supportive friendships. Strangers rarely care about you.

I'm sorry about your abusive ex. However women aren't ruined by the dating apps. If you meet some women who aren't into you, it doesn't mean anything is wrong with them. You just aren't their type. And even if you are not one girl's type, the next girl you meet might think you are awesome.

Relationships are meant to be equal though. You aren't meant to just put in a lot of effort for someone who shows no interest back. What usually happens: you meet someone, for example at a small party with your friends. There is a vibe, you flirt with each other. Then you continue flirting via text. And then the guy might ask her out, but it's clear that you both are into each other. And then you date, but both people put effort and energy into that.

Dating apps aren't real life though, they are 70-80% male and it's hard to find a girl there. So it's better to join some hobbies and activities, make more friends, get an active social life. That might also make you feel less lonely and more like you have emotional support in your life. Everyone needs that and I can tell you miss it. 

Most couples meet in social settings, not online. And through friends is the most common way.  That doesn't mean hit on girls on the street though, that's not a social setting.

"Reddit is a hell of a place to ask for help, but here goes.

I'm 26 with chronic back pain. L4-L5 protruding disc pressing on nerves. I'm taking the logical steps to reduce the pain. Dr's, specialists, I have referrals ready to go for physio and getting a cortisone injection, yet I have a lack of urgency even though the pain affects me every day. I take Panadeine every so often when it gets really bad.

What I find myself stuck on is the ""why?"". Why should I do all of that? Why do I deserve to not be in pain? Why am I worth fixing? Which is arguably more debilitating than my physical pain. 

I loathe myself. I hate how I look, hate how I feel and hate being in pain all the time, yet I feel like the ""why?"" is the brick wall in front of me.

I'm at a 4."" except that pain was there so I'm actually at a 1.

"I’m a 23 yr old male. We’ll keep this brief. There’s this girl, we’ll call her S. S is one of the managers at my job (a car dealership). She’s well loved and untouchable. We have a semi toxic work place. We joke, say harsh things as you’d expect at a car dealership but it’s in good fun usually. It usually stops at “fuck you” tbh. Then we all laugh and work 

Since I started this job, I’ve been the quiet little brother. My co workers are slightly older than I am. So I often share my situations in life to get their advice. And, we’ll, I overshare sometimes. But S is the only one who uses it against me. When I started the job, I had no car. I didn’t have the credit to get one and it’s no secret that my credit isn’t the best. Long story short, I worked my ass off four months to afford a new Dodge Charger (my dream car and she knew that) . I was so happy, drove it around for a few days..only for S to “joke” with me and tell me that there was a problem with my paperwork (S’s sole job is financing paperwork) and I had to get a different, cheaper car.. I damn near broke down right then. Someone saw the joke wasn’t received  well and said she was only joking.. 

Since then, S has been more and more demanding and rude. I told her I might’ve gone back to college because I wanted to study philosophy. She just started going in on me. “Let’s see..you’re 23? You have nothing going for yourself? You barely sell cars. You do just enough to keep your job…” the list goes on. She’s not wrong. I’ve had a rough life but I’m trying to make the best of it..still, ts stung. I’ve noticed S talks to me in a way she wouldn’t to other people. I’ve rebutted a few times but always in a joking manner. I don’t wanna lose my job.. but I don’t want to be a wimp either. I dread going to this job I used to love because of her comments."

"Start graywalling her slightly and increasingly with time. 

Make sure to strengthen your relationship with everyone else, do not let her presence make you avoid other people in the group.

 Feel free to drop innocent sounding sentences to your other coulleges either in private or smaller groupes ""Man, (her name) is not in a good mood, she just ripped into me for saying I want to go to college"".

She probably said something that bothered someone else as well so with time they will chip in. Make sure not to make yourself look like a victim of bullying but rather a workplace problem.

Be careful with it in the beginning. Don't drop 5 complaints in 5 days. Give it time, do one every 2 weeks or something like that.

"A joke and banter are only a joke and banter when both parties mutually are enjoying it and no feelings are hurt. Your feelings are being hurt. This is no longer fun and it's affecting your mental health and making you question yourself and your feelings. 

Considering you tried to express yourself in the past and it didn't go well, it's no wonder you're unsure if you should seriously say anything. 

I will say, if you decide to respond with extreme emotions or actions in retaliation, it will make everything worse. When dealing with abusive people and bullies, they will weaponize any emotions and actions against you. Also if you gossip about her like someone here suggested, that will also eventually be weaponized against you. 

The best thing to do here is just completely stonewall her. Don't respond to her or anything she has to say, just pretend she doesn't exist. Only respond to her if it's strictly work related. Talk to other people who are actually nice to you. And do not say anything further about your personal life to her, or whenever she's around. 

If you can, go to the boss above your boss and try to discuss with them about her behavior. Gather evidence if you can. Or if you have other managers that could possibly assist you or are nicer to you, try to talk to them in private. 

If this continues even after stonewalling, then you should perhaps look into a job where they treat you better. All the hopes and dreams you have are not stupid or wrong, never let anyone convince you of that. You can get there as long as you take the steps towards those goals and persist despite these negative assholes.

"When I dealt with something similar -  I borrowed advice I heard on line.  


I noted 2 specific incidents that I didn't appreciate - and I waited for a third. When the third happened and I asked simply and in the moment.

""Why do you think it's acceptable to speak to me that way?"" 

""What way? It's only a joke.""

""Well no, because this isn't the first time, and then (without anger and emotion) I outlined the two other specific incidents. now I like you and I like working here and I don't want to fall out with you but I don't appreciate being spoken to in that manner.""

  


They didn't say much just kinda grumbled a bit but they didn't ever speak to me that way again.

Of course, if this is the workplace culture there might be a couple of other things in the mix - have you been laughing along with the boys at her expense? You might not have earned that right yet.   


She might also, given she's a woman feel she has to come down hard on you to get respect from the rest of the office.

"Been a while since I've done one of these things.  I'm 30, short, fat, ugly, another sad emotionally lonely virgin, and newly crippled in one leg. If you couldn't tell I hate myself. I tried to be better especially in my 20s. I worked out, I ate right and made an effort to meet new people. IT NEVER WORKED. I was 25 when I got a very cozy job. It came with housing in a beautiful yet ISOLATED location. My job is about THE only thing I like about myself. It allowed me to buy a car. I also have a good yet distant relationship with my family. All of this I was okay with until I became 30 and felt like I waisted my 20's  

My younger brother has a wife and kids. A car accident at work shatterd my knee cap. It have me the opportunity to visit them and it was then that I started to realize just how crippling lonely I was. This last December I got diagnosed with diabetes and may car needed a transition rebuilt. 

First I tried to buy a car that should have no trouble surviving my work conditions but Instead this thing sucks so much money from my bank account especially with rising California gas prices. Dispite my job this I never have any money to go anywhere. And traveling is ofcouse one of the few dreams I thought I had left. I'm never going to leave the awful god forsaken desert.

Second being diagnosed with adult onset diabetes was bad enough. It ment that my years trying to live a healthy life style ment nothing. But on top of this it has made me impotent. Now I am an emotionally lonely virgin. A part of this is because sex was never that important to me. But you are lying to yourself if you think sex isn't important for a healthy relationship. Intimacy and eventually having family to call my own, is all something I wanted to experience eventually... And I think that's gone. I've never had any one love me or express companionship with me... And I don't think that will ever happen."	TheLostCoyote	post	29.978233333417265	male	White	0.9985163807868958	na	na	na	4	malementalhealth

But this last time I got down I have not been able to come back up yet because the push downwards was too heavy.

Long story short: I was left by my so-called friends, my gf turned out to be a tool. My promotion at the job kept getting pushed back... all of of this over the couse pf 2 years made me feel alone and so I got addicted(gradually over time) to the devil's lettuce.

"There is ZERO tolerance or patience for inexperienced people. Whenever I think about whether I have a chance or whether people are more open than I think, I’m instantly reminded of things like [this thread](https:/np.reddit.com/r/ihavesex/comments/10p5ith/these_guys_out_here_trying_to_collect_em_all/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Sex is literally everywhere and literally everything comes back to sex. People all around will endless talk in detail about how much sex they have and how they do not tolerate anyone who doesn’t. So many people are obsessed with sex and base a good amount of people’s worth around how much they get and how good they are at it. Even the most sex/body positive people around are focused on people’s sex lives and how it defines their worth. If you are sexually inexperienced at an older age it’s basically fucking over. At 22 it is 100% abnormal for me to not have had sex yet when the overwhelming majority of people my age and slightly younger have done it. I’m SUPPOSED to have gotten it by now, it isn’t negotiable or arguable it is an unshakable societal standard. Virginity is one of the absolute worst turnoffs for anyone and a massive red flag for anyone. Who tf wants to waste their time with a virgin? Who wants to instruct a sloppy weirdo who doesn’t know what to do? If you are not fucking like a rabbit in your prime you do not have any legs to stand on later in life. Most people will 100% abandon you in a heartbeat for someone who is more experienced and interesting. I had my chances with losing it naturally in high school or if I went to college, but now those are gone and now I’m left out to dry.

No its not. Those are your hormones talking. Fake it until you make it. Women can't smell virginity like you seem to think we can.

"Every day I do the same thing - I go to work, I come home and play videogames for a few hours, then I go to sleep and repeat. It's been like this for years, even back when I was in school I studied and stayed at home by myself.


It's like I HAVE to stay in this soulless lifestyle or I'll be punished for trying to change. I try and buy clothes I actually like wearing? I have to deal with certain relatives making comments as if I'm making a mistake wearing something they didn't choose out. I try and talk to someone and befriend them? They straight up ignore me as if I'm not even sitting across from them. I go to the gym? I make no progress whatsoever and everyone around me lifts heavier weights as a fucking warmup. I try and speak up for myself when certain people in my life are trying to manipulate me? Suddenly I'm the abusive one and if I don't start kissing their ass again my siblings are at risk of having their home taken away from them. I can't even fucking move out because there's a fucking housing crisis and I can't even afford the cheapest place even if I ignore groceries and electricity+water bills.

I'm so tired of people around me doing better - they're studying and getting new cars and moving out of their parents homes and hanging out with friends and getting laid and here I am sitting in the same corner of my bedroom playing fucking gacha games because spending my entire paycheck on weapons and anime girls is probably the only thing I can reliably look forward to.

I'm trying to change things for the better and nothing fucking works. I want to believe it gets better but it feels hopeless when every attempt I make ends up failing."	dandy_dandy_dandy	post	17.61647141196478	female	White	0.9994878768920898	na	na	na	6	malementalhealth

"I’ve recently been caught in another bout of suicidal thoughts and feelings over being alone. Like many other posters here, I’m a virgin in his early 20’s and it really bothers me. This isn’t due to the lack of sex thing, but rather the lack of connection, the idea that no woman even wants to be with me is a depressing prospect and it’s getting to me more and mote every day.

This may cone off as whiny but this is legitimately how I feel, I can’t talk about this in my life amongst my friends and so I post on here. No one knows that for the past week I’ve been living minute to minute as I’m about as suicidal as I’ve ever been. I have a plan and feel like I’m on a hair trigger from doing it. I feel like I’ve failed at something I’ve wanted so bad for so long.

This isn’t for a lack of trying, I put in the work. I put myself out there, I’m outgoing and talk with people, I take care of myself physically, I ask girls out on dates but I’m still at square one. I’ve been spinning my tires for a while and I’ve gotten nowhere. I also can’t just “not care” about it as some have mentioned as this is something that I’ve really wanted for a long time now, if’s so ingrained that the idea will come up and I’ll feel shame for not being successful in it yet.

I barely care about anything else in my life at this point. I don’t see any point in doing anything if I’m gonna be alone forever.

I wish I could give you some sure fire solution, but I can't. In my twenties, I was lonely and hooked up with a lot of women that, in retrospect did me more harm than good. It's almost impossible to expect someone suffering from loneliness to be be selective about who they get involved with. Most people of both genders are at best poor companions and often are self-serving predators one way or another due to their own issues and insecurities. The long term strategy, sadly, is to be selective and critical about who you get tangled up with, be as authentic as you can be, respect your own welfare but find ways to circulate as much as possible. Many women are naturally cautious of getting involved with men they don't know. Circulating socially and making friends with a lot of women means that their friends can safely vet you over time and decide if they want to get to know you, rather than being put on the spot by getting asked out by a stranger. In that respect, being in one woman's friend zone Isn't that bad if it introduces you to her circle of friends. I can't remember where I read it, but I once saw love defined as mutually complementary psychoses, and when I look around, I think I see this a lot. So there is a chance what you see as deficiencies in yourself may be the key in the lock for the deficiencies of some woman you meet. It might sound sad, but I think it's often the way for many people. If you can be authentic to yourself, it's the best way to find a fit with someone else. If you try to snare someone by being inauthentic, then it's a bad fit and a formula for eventual failure.	wwavyBoi	reply	na	na	na	0.9915012121200562	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"Hi All, just found this sub. My question is simple. For those who have received and have successfully benefitted from medication, when did you know or come to realize that you had a mental health issues? And when did you know that medication was the best course of action? 

I’ve put aside my mental health for awhile, have sought treatment via therapy once before but did not help me in the slightest. I feel like I have anxiety but know (or feel like I know) that I am depressed. My mind runs 25/8 and it’s exhausting. Sometimes I do feel like medication is the right thing, other times I don’t. I would just like to hear from someone with experience. If I find that it is time, what’s the next step to getting medication? What do they typically prescribe for someone with possible anxiety and depression?

I can’t speak for how the process operates in the civilian sector, but for me I realized I had issues that needed dealing with when I was considering going AWOL or offing myself. Had one previous attempt before I enlisted that went un-noticed, so if anything, I’d say it’s time to reach out as soon as one has even considered it an option or done some basic self-evaluation and realized they find themselves ruminating a lot. That being said, getting a good psychologist and psychiatrist are the initial keys to putting a good mental health journey on track. Figuring out the right meds and therapy style follows after.	_cedarCrest76	reply	na	na	na	0.019992848858237267	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"The first sign was my unwillingness to wake up in the morning. Wanting to hide in bed and not live life. I then started googling depression symptoms and I discovered that I had many other symptoms I was not aware of. Foggy brain check. Amplified problems check. Decelerating memory check. Inability to enjoy the small happy things check. Inability to sleep check. Loss appetite check. The only symptom I never had was suicidal thoughts.

These symptoms are different from one person to the other. But what is in common is the ""inability to achieve daily functions"" as you normally would.

I tried therapy but it did not help. Or at least it needed a lot of time. While I needed to be up on my feet quick to not be a pain for people around me.

That is when I started my gradual treatment on Escitalopram (Cipralex / Lexapro). The doc got me started on a low dose. First three weeks were a bit weird but he asked me to stay the course. Then we gradually upped the dosage until I felt ME again.

My brain fog cleared away. I was able to better take decisions. I started enjoying the small happy moments. I just cant explain it other than...this drug made me me again.

It's not all rainbows and daisies as I tried to wean off three times so far. And it worked until I had a major stressor. Then I had to go back on the meds. Not that its addictive, its not, but it seems I might have chronic depression and I might need to stay on this med for good.

It does not bother me as it doesnt have any major side effects on me. (Except for lasting longer in sex, not complaining here if you know what I mean).

All in all, I am grateful I started my medication. Throughout the past few years I have met many people whove been through this path and had similar stories to tell. 

Obviously each case is different, but if you feel you are struggling and want to be up on your feet again, talk to your doctor, take a second opinion, and then decide.

So my boyfriend is very quiet, typical guy, who works mid week and plays ps5 around that. He’s just out of college and doesn’t know what to do with himself. He’s not a drinker and as a result has lost contact with almost all of the people he considered close friends. He doesn’t reach out and his schedule doesn’t deviate from the above much. He hates exercise and going places where he is not 100% comfortable. He stays in his room during most of his free time and doesn’t interact outside of work with anyone but me and his family.

"First, this would be best handled with a therapist. It's really hard to give suggestions on what to do with getting him to open up about what exactly he's struggling with.

One thing is clear. He's found comfort doing the same thing every day. Any slight deviation from this routine is scary and potentially painful for him. The only way out is for him to decide he wants to change it. He has to put himself in those uncomfortable zones over and over if he wants to get better."	b4b1e	reply	na	na	na	0.9977263808250427	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"Some of the advice on here is really bad...  
Please do NOT put a potential ultimatum in front of him by telling him you will leave if he doesnt get better.  
Dont take away his escape tools without being sure thats the cause or accelerator for his unhealthy behavior. Its more likely thats the only thing that he can think of doing, or can get himself to do. If you take it away its gonna be replaced by Phone/TV/Sleeping the day away. Tho once he is in a better place it can be smart to make them harder to accsess.  


One thing is def. to talk to him, straight forward and direkt, without belitteling/accusing him. Ask why he doesnt feel like reaching out to his friends, why he does not want to be physically active, even just to go for a walk.  


Be aware that helping someone with mental problems is WORK and is not something done without effort... from both parties ofc. But its a lot of taking that person by the hand and guiding them closely. It gets impossible if they dont want to walk at all (which is where the  asking, talking and making him aware that stuff CAN be better for him is important), or if you dont want to walk with them. Often as soon as you let go of their hands they stop, cause they dont know what to do or are afraid to continue. Like a child who stops peddaling once the parent stops to runs next to them when learning how to ride a bike.

What you want to do is show him and guide him on how to be more sociable and show him that the effort of reaching out and getting out of ones comfort zone is worth it. Stuff like asking him to go on a walk with you (where you can talk to eachother), take him with you when you go grocery shopping, ask him for small favors (""can you fix this/bring me this"" feeling usefull helps a lot of men even if its small things, it adds up). Show your appreciation of him to the fullest you feel comfortable with. Hug+Kiss for bringing you a glass of water etc. for example.  


On those walk+talks, ask him how he feels with stuff is going currently, if he thinks stuff could be better, if he has any plans on how it could be better. Im sure he has some thoughs on that matter but they are probably all bleak to him.  


Once hes in a bit of a more healthy state, try to make him arrange something with his old friends. Maybe ask if a little grill party with some of his and some of your friends would be nice. Make him help out with the planning but dont put the burden on him if he falls back into a bad mental state. Or arange double date with another couple you know and feel good with. These are steps to learn how to resozialize. With you as a partner to make him still have someone around to be comfrotable with.  


After those social events ask him how he feels (directly after probably a bit spent, so maybe the day after that), if he would like to have social gatherings like those more often, what was good what was bad in general about the social experience (not necessairly ""oh the burgers were bit bland or something"").  


Thats where you can hopefully convince him that reaching out to friends to be social and outgoing is worth it even if the initiation is scary/takes effort/makes one potentially uncomfortable. Men often dont want to come across as someone who needs others/needy in general which is why they dont reach out. His friends might even have similar issues with being stuck at at home.  


Anyway... hope this gave you some ideas. Be compassionate, loving (and express that love), and guide him out. It will take time and effort from your part, dont expect ""i told you this. you should be fixed now"".

Goes without saying, but if he somehow mentions that he can't feel free talking to you for whatever reason, a therapist is the best and maybe only way for him to see and belive he can change. And also even if the stuff you already do is working and Helping: a therapist might still be Good to guide his thoughts a tiny bit extra.

"My childhood wasn’t the best. I’m fortunate enough to have parents and a sibling, but back then we were all divided and at war with one another. It stunted my growth and I could never talk to people my age normally because of how different I was due to my upbringing. In high school I toxically tried to catch up and be better so I could compare to the people around me but I never felt good enough. After high school I tried to live my best life as me but wherever I went and whoever I met I just couldn’t let them see me. 

Now in college I’ve learned a lot of lessons, I’ve become much more aware of my strengths and I know I can overcome my shortcomings. I’m still behind in a lot of areas but I’m ahead in a few too. I can see the holes in the people around me and all I want to do is help fill them up. I know who I wanna be and I know where I am. I know what it’s gonna take and I don’t care how hard it’s gonna be. I’ve caught up and I don’t need to make up for lost time anymore. I’m going to blast ahead of everyone else and nobody is going to stop me from getting it done. 

I’m still scared to learn what I’m capable of. I’m still scared of people seeing me for who I am. I still make lots of dumb mistakes and I still embarrass myself. Regardless, I can’t hide anymore I gotta get tougher and adapt. This is the year I turn every last lesson, experience and advice I’ve internalized and I manifest it externally.

"I hope this story motivates others, but 2 years ago at the start of the new year i had everything a guy could want an awesome career and a very sexually active gf. everything was going great until i got fired from my job due to not enough business which was tough, that itself felt like a break up because i thought highly of the boss, it was a small business where you knew everyone and it was minority owned, but anyways you know i applied to other jobs that same week i got fired ignored my pain and frustration i thought to myself id process my emotions after i got another job and well i got another job a better one in a months time span 

and then in that same month my gf of 2 and a half years left me we had planned a vacation as well but had to cancel it due to her breaking up with me, you know i had no hard feelings because we both helped each other out from a dark place in our lives we were both rebounds to each other after our previous relationships and well it was bound to happen but not even two weeks later i saw her snuggled up in bed with another man and boy did that hurt, i texted her who was that? and she told me someone she knew and at least it wasnt a total stranger and i just told her to take care of herself and that was it i blocked her on everything, but  i couldnt get the image of her doing the things she did with me but with that other man out of my head i thought i was going crazy, so after the break up i was working and working out and trying not to let it influence my work but it was hard thats all i thought about that image of her and him, ofc i blocked her on everything so i wont see anything related to her, i tried not to think or do anything really that reminded me of her. 

i was hurting so bad man i called up a few chicks i use to mess around with to get over her and well it just hurt me so bad to do those things with them, i felt like crying while getting head man like it was that bad, i had this deep feeling of just wanting to hurt myself so i just started working out instead to feel something, and i got my first tattoo as well idk why but the pain made me feel better, you know i did those things instead of just cutting myself because im mature enough to know what self harm does to you so i might as well do something positive with that negative energy, but the most harmful thing i did was immediately start the dating scene again after breaking up, lookin for love in all the wrong places was a mistake because a lot of woman will take advantage of you if youre not careful enough, 

i had some bad experiences but also some good ones too, also idk what it was but i decided to learn from each date or hook up take some knowledge worth it see the silver lining, for example this ""poor"" girl that was using me for rides and food she would text me pick me up here take me there can you take me to my friends, well she used me but i would also help her and her friends that didnt have rides to their jobs single mothers poor people that didnt have other means of transportation other than a bus you know i felt like at least something positive came from that (idk what other polite term to use instead of saying poor), another example i talked to this girl for about 2-3 weeks i listened to her goals and ambitions which attracted me to her to make a move and it turned into a one night stand, you know i told her everything about my situation during that time and she told me sometimes its best to just sit down and take the time to process your emotions which helped a lot i still use that method now its very helpful for when i feel something negative or positive. 

so basically i looked for the positive in all those dating experiences i had that year, and well after about 8 months i met my current gf, this is just my experience my point of view you know after a while of dating i talked to multiple woman i gave almost every girl i talked to a chance but a lot of them werent it, being 27 single male wit no kids i thought id have settle for a woman with kids respectfully its not something i wanted but the dating scene wasnt giving me any other choice, i hanged in there i put myself out there, i would do meet ups like indoor soccer groups and bar afterwards id go out and try to make new friends, id explore my city be outgoing as much as possible no matter the pain and uncomfortableness i felt, i was never home only to sleep i was being outgoing as much as possible. so after a few months of doing that i eventually met my gf thru a dating app you know i was catfished heavily on that app so i didnt expect much before i met her, and there she was my beautiful angel awaitng for me to pick her up for our date, and man did i fall hard for her. i really put myself out there risked getting hurt being hurt multiple times but if i didnt do that i would of never met her or have never gotten a better job. i dont really regret anything because it all lead up to this point, im proud of myself actually very proud i went thru my own personal hell and i survived that, i know people have been thru worse but you can come back from it ive read stories of how people survived homelessness and similar stories that motivated me, you know  i started appreciating things more after losing a lot. 

i picked myself up and kept moving forward hoping for the best.

Huh??? At 27, no you don't! You're a GUY! You can just date a 20 year old and no one outside of reddit feminists will care. Heck, if you got dumped at 40 you could start over and date a 20-something. That's the best part about being male: do-overs until you're 50. I was 20 when I met my husband; he was 30.

I don't think I can bear life anymore. I hate myself and how undesirable I am because of an attribute I have no control over. I am 28 and have never had a relationship and probably never will yet the media and society constantly force down my throat how normal sex and relationships are for everyone else. I can barely go a day without a reminder of how my height prevents me from partaking in that realm. I honestly feel like suicide is my only escape from the feelings of bitterness, jealousy, resentment and anger. I have tried therapy and anti-depressants in the past but nothing has helped because I don't have a psychological problem I am simply unattractive and will always be unattractive. I feel like letting me die is merciful.	StressReliefRant	post	23.840420978552803	female	White	0.9985225796699524	na	na	na	15	malementalhealth

"[A recent Pew Research study suggests a tectonic shift in the dating and sex life of men. The study found that among men under 30 years old, over 60 percent are single, almost double that of women in the same age bracket.  Not only are more young men single but their opportunities for developing a relational and sexual repertoire have all but vanished, as levels of sexual intimacy across genders appear to have hit a 30-year low (Lei & South, 2021).](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-state-of-our-unions/202302/why-are-so-many-young-men-single-and-sexless)

""Not only are more young men single, **but their opportunities for developing a relational and sexual repertoire have all but vanished.""**

So, I want to say I can't fix this for you. There is no magic formula to change your results.

But I *can* say, with a fair amount of authority, you are not alone. You're not even unusual. You being 'undesirable' isn't rare; it's *the majority* for men your age.

Media does kind of cram the narrative that having sex and relationships is normal. And, well, for me - at your age - it was. But that's long been untrue, and even in my time I could see the signs. Growing hatred and mistrust of men, parodies and negative caricatures becoming more and more common and acceptable, etcetera. Now we're seeing this prejudice against men in full bloom, and it is every bit as awful as any other kind of bias and prejudice.

I can't say things will work out for you. I can say, it's not you. It's really, really not you. It is not your fault. People will try to tell you it is, tell you you're not trying hard enough, or being smart enough, but no. This is what societal prejudice looks like. And it is not ok."

"Hey, I’m in the same boat as you man, same age, even the same height. I’ll tell you it’s not the height, but I don’t know how to get out of this hell either. I have friends who I’ve been friends with for 13-14 years, they are all as tall as me or shorter even and all of them are either married or in a serious relationship. Them and their SOs know me inside and out, and none of them understand why I haven’t been able to be in a relationship. Sometimes life just deals you a shit hand for no reason. People in relationships don’t want to admit it because it means it doesn’t have anything to do with how “great” they are, but in reality there’s a lot of luck involved when it comes to finding someone who’s the right fit for you.

People need human connection. I know if I didn’t have my friends’ support I would’ve killed myself a long time ago. Maybe you just need some more human connection.

Your height is definitely not your issue. I emphasize with you a lot, though. When I was your age I also knew nothing about relationships. The tables will flip eventually when you are older, but let me give you some advice in the mean time.

There is a lot of relationship books and videos available online. Search YouTube and watch some. There are a lot of good books, but in your case I recommend “Models” by Mark Manson and “How to be a 3% man” by Corey Wayne.

If you are convinced that your height is the issue (which I assure you it’s not) — think about moving to a country/location where people are shorter instead of doing what you said."	StressReliefRant	reply	na	na	na	0.9985225796699524	weak	strong	strong	na	malementalhealth

"I have experienced difficult periods of time as you describe. I offer you my empathy and hope for your recovery. On a practical note, make small, achievable goals on a daily basis. Start with something like take a shower daily or change out of PJs every day. Progress to spending time out doors, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, whatever you can do. When you are ready, take a walk outside every day. 
As difficult as it is to even conceive of right now, you will need to form connections. We are wired for connection and we achieve optimal well- being when we have meaningful connections. Form connections with people around an area of interest. For example, if you like growing plants connect with people over that. Reddit communities are one way to start. It doesn’t involve venturing outside. Work up to connecting with people in your local community. Build a life around your interests.
This is important: stop spending all of your free time alone in your room researching mental health topics. I am not saying stop caring about your mental health. You have to take care of it just like any other aspect of your health, but you must limit your time devoted to researching mental health topics. Work with people in the mental health professions to help you work through your struggles. Remember, your struggles do not define you. You are not your mental health condition. It takes time, but get to know what you like and let that be your focus.
I found liberation in the thought, “There is nothing wrong with me.” This thought doesn’t deny your actual state of being. Rather, it identifies it as an experience in life instead of who you are. Where you find yourself is not of your own making. It is my belief that fundamentally there is nothing wrong with the man you are at heart. See if you can let that thought sink in and grow.

"I'm 31.  I didn't date much when I was younger, and it's been a journey learning as an adult what I think most people learn as kids.  I've always been a nerd (programming, science, finance, a smattering of philosophy, etc) and I'm religious; both of those contributed to me being a late bloomer in this area.  I've never kissed a girl, for an example.  I actually dodged, when I was 14, when a girl tried to kiss me; it was very romantic and I was very much feeling it, but I wasn't planning to kiss until my wedding.  This remained with me until I was about 28.  I read some psychology research, changed my mind, and now would like to kiss on ~a third date, or whatever she's comfortable with.

I really like who I am.  I think I'm healthy.  [Random list of attributes--] I'm emotionally open.  I have close friendships.  I'm reliable.  I am generous when I can be, and I usually can.  I'm the sort of person that people call ""a catch"" .. but only people who are already with someone else.  Some of my friends think I'm autistic; (I mention that since it's relevant to the profile, not because I agree with it.  I'm hit or miss on the symptoms; I feel pretty balanced to be honest.  As far as I can tell, I just _really_ enjoy deep thinking of the scientifically/skeptically grounded variety.)  I run a 5k most summer weekends, and it's not particularly hard.  I have good hygiene.  I floss.  I'm not aware of anything that's objectionable about me, other than perhaps my overuse of punctuation (jk).

I'm looking for a woman who is both somewhat scientifically/skeptically oriented, and approximately shares my religious/political views.  (I'm a liberal christian.)  I am aware that `scientific/skeptical` and `religious` are inversely correlated in the population.  But there are some.  I've been on _first_ dates with several of them.

Women don't tend to want a second date with me.  The most recent person who did, wasn't right for me.  I discovered about a month in that she basically believed that since she was pretty she didn't need to think, and that the times I thought we had connected intellectually, .. well, when I talked she would just sorta nod, and when I asked her questions about her work (she is also sorta a programmer) she'd answer them while wishing I wouldn't bring up work on her off hours.

It's entirely possible that I just haven't found the right person yet.  But it's also the case that the common element in these relationships is me, and I'd like to explore what might be wrong with me, so I can improve it.

Past Hypotheses:

- I'm fundamentally not a fun person.  This seems to be true from the average person's perspective, but I've brought this up and my friends don't really agree that I'm not fun; some of them sorta agree, some emphatically disagree.  So I think this isn't true from the perspective of the type of person I'm trying to attract.
- I don't really have much ego (as in, activation energy to do something).  When people ask where I want to go out to eat, I used to answer that I didn't care, because it was mostly true.  Then I read an article about decision burden.  Now I express that I don't have a preference but am willing to pick at random if no one else has a preference either.  Someone else almost always expresses a preference.  (If I was being honest, my value function for picking a restaurant has to do with right-sizing calories while minimizing cost; this correlates pretty well with minimizing fun, so I very rarely express it.)  The trouble with this hypothesis is that I have no shortage of interesting topics I want to bring up, to talk about, and that seems like a function of ego.

A friend's hypothesis:

- I do too much ""friending"" and not enough ""dating"".  I have no idea what that means.

Today's Hypothesis:

It occurred to me today that I have tried a wide variety of topics of discussion, on various first dates.  But I think I present myself one-dimensionally within the date.  For an example, the most recent person I went on a date with had put on her dating profile that she really enjoys good questions, and being listened to, as she answers them.  So I made that date all about asking her questions (I still remember some of her answers, so I think I listened).  She didn't really ask me very many questions in return, so I answered a few of mine after she did, to balance out the talking time a bit.  I thought the date went really well.  And then she unmatched me without explanation.

And that's a theme to the one-dimensionality thing -- I think the approach I take up is significantly a reflection of the other person's personality.  I act like a chameleon, to some degree.  So I googled that, and got a bunch of psychology stuff about co-dependence.  I... well, just like with basically every other psychology thing I've looked up, it just doesn't resonate with me.  Sure, I have a lot of the traits it mentioned, but I also don't have a lot of the traits it mentioned.  And I don't have any obvious trauma like what it suggests would cause it.  I really do think I'm pretty well balanced.

What I don't have is the social skills that I don't have yet.  (Yes, that's intended to be a tautology.)  If this one-dimensional thing is the issue, it's because I just haven't learned this skill yet -- the skill of adding breadth to a first conversation.  This is a repeating pattern in my life.  I walk forward until I fall on my face, I find what I tripped on, I learn it, and then I get further the next time and the cycle repeats.

Females want an easy playful interaction,while looking up and making a questions upfront might sound like a good idea,in reality it's exhausting. It's not a natural conversation. I'm currently friends with a guy who's like that. Every response of mine is met with 100 questions about details. It's not making him look thoughtful but annoying. Like if I tell him I made a sandwich. He will ask me what kind of sandwich,even if I just told him. Where did I buy the bread? Do I eat it often? In what order did I put on my ingredients? Do I make bread from scratch? Did I eat sandwiches as a child? Holy shit it's exhausting. He's a nice guy but I can see why he can't find anyone for dates. Also you seem to think everything from intellectual perspective, hypothesis and researching things online. Sometimes intelligence is about knowing when to kiss a female and how to make her laugh. I'm the one who also likes intelligent men who are excited about learning new things but if he will not make me laugh or sweep me off my feet by a random kiss,boredom will ensue. Don't overthink it,don't overburden your dates. Bring them to nice places. Be respectful but playful. Tell them that you are just looking to take care of them,not sexually first or financially but by just keeping them safe and being respectful. That's all! Best of wishes in the future.	8HtTfmnrWZc4	reply	na	na	na	0.002715775743126869	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"I am in my early-twenties(22) and currently struggling to find my purpose in life. I often find myself torn between different career paths, unsure of which one to pursue. I am hoping to seek guidance and advice from those who have experienced similar struggles or have insights to share.

On one hand, I am considering learning web development, specifically focusing on html/css/js and if you look on my post history i am doing it currently alongside with job. I am aware that this field is oversaturated at the entry level, but the potential for a high income without a degree is appealing. However, I am also intimidated by the numerous frameworks and libraries which i will have to learn, which can be overwhelming for a beginner. projects made by me are total garbage.  Also to be honest i have not any interest in this field and currently learning  it only for money.

On another hand, I am also drawn to the growing field of data science. I find  math to be intriguing, and this field seems to be expanding rapidly. Pursuing a degree in this field seems like a viable option, but I am afraid  about potentially  failing at this path and wasting my 20s.

Furthermore, in regards of my current situation  I have graduated law, but the legal industry in my country pays poorly so i am concerned about missing opportunities in lucrative field of tech and i constantly tell myself that if you work harder for 2/3 years maybe you will land well paying job. but since middle school i was not friend with numbers and performed terribly in STEM subjects so at least it seems safer path but less rewarding. 

At the same time, I desire financial stability and the ability to provide for my family. my dream is too safe up money up to one million.   I feel like i am in my turning point right now, feel anxious everyday , concerned that I may make a devastating mistake in choosing the wrong path. I blame myself to be unprincipled, inconsistent stupid, individual.

How to choose one right path to follow principally ?

Thank you in advance for your guidance and support."	No_Car5573	post	23.38344105387219	female	White	0.010889491066336632	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth
"I'm going through some of the same issues right now as well, and I have a couple things I think you should consider about webdev.

1. Yeah, there's a ton of frameworks, but a lot are very similar so if you know one, you know 90% of any other.  It's not as scary as it sounds once you get into it.
2. Yeah, your projects probably suck compared to professional websites.  Don't worry about it; you're one novice, not a team of experts.

"I've been having this mental issue for a very long time.  
Could say around 4 years. I've been trying to analyze myself, but I seem not able to understand anything.

Myself: I am a ambitious final year I.T student, interest in chess, programming and sports.

I am currently burned out, or so I think I am. I have not been able to learn/focus on a task for very long without needing breaks. After studying I need to take a nap, even if its a minor task.  
It was after working as a server on weekends that I realize I have severely burned out.   
Working 10 hours in the restaurant, made me chronically fatigued for 3 straight days.  
I'm also having a hard time forming words and doing any tasks in general.  
I stopped going to work, but I still feel drained

I tried relaxing by scrolling on Reddit/9Gag and watching videos on YouTube. But it gets boring and I still unconsciously go back to learning, but unable to focus for a minute.

I tried video games, but in the end feel more terrible. Like I'm wasting life. Probably due to my parents/grandparents not liking video games

More about me: I am an INTJ personality type. I like difficult challenges like algorithms/chess and learning. 

Lately I've been more isolated, hostile and angry toward my friends. I feel empty/drained as if I am suffering every minute. I feel like a waste of life, however I tell myself it is not true, cause I've done a lot in the previous years like learning new languages and programming languages.    
I want to change my situation, build back the relationships I lost and improve my mental health.

I usually do not share my feelings, but I feel the online community can give me better suggestion than myself?

"I hate getting up in the morning. Like absolutely loathe getting out of bed. This morning for example, I woke up an hour and a half prior to needing to be at work, but didn't get out of bed until just enough time to get to work to not be considered late. I've always kind of been like that. My wife says yes it makes sense because a lot of people don't like waking up, but when it's the weekend and she has coffee for me and breakfast and a what should be wonderful day planned out for us, I choose to lay back down. It's actually really kind of fucked, because I don't even really like sleeping all that much. I only do it out of necessity. I like being a night owl and doing work, research, or just game at night. Even the activities that I tell people I enjoy doing, I don't do as much as I believe I should. I used to love going to the gym, but because it is less convenient to go now, I don't. Going to the caverns, outdoor trails, or nature parks doesn't ever sound like fun, unless I distinctly made the idea or comment to go. My wife will ask me if I want to go on a walk with the dog and I just don't want to leave the house. I just paid for the premium version of door dash to ""save"" money to order delivery. My car works just fine, and most the places I order food from is no more than 10-15 min from home. 

Is this normal? Is this depression? Are these just bad habits that I can break? I'm completely self aware of myself doing this. I don't enjoy living life like this. It doesn't feel fulfilling at all. So, why do I continue living like this? I've tried to get help from a behavioral health specialists but the video call was malfunctioning and they rescheduled me for almost a month and a half out.

"1. Put the online dating thing on pause right now. Online dating has become extraordinarily toxic and worthless in the last 8 years, and you are clearly not in the head space to be in a relationship right now. The people you attract will be broken and abusive at best. Just put this on hold for a moment. 

2. Your parents calls for you to go to university are understandable but misguided at this point. University prices have tripled in the last 10 years, and 10 years ago they were already unaffordable. There is no reason for you to enter into $320,000 of debt. You will graduate unable to afford a house or a car with $8,000 a month payments. 

3. Get an entry level job in Manufacturing or field engineering right now. Literally right now, these companies can't hire people fast enough!! There is no experience required and the only thing you need to have to succeed is the desire to learn and not being an idiot. Defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed martin, to Mechanical construction firms need people and are willing to pay a big chunk of change for them. This is only step one however... 

4. Because step two is that these companies will also give you a free ride to college in some sort of stem major that will help them. You can go to school completely for free, graduate with no debt, only have to work for the company for 4 years post graduation, and you will make roughly $120,000 a year OR More. Be up front about your career goals when you apply so they can track you! Electrical and mechanical engineering, PMC programming, structural- you will literally be able to get a job anywhere. Your LinkedIn would be perpetually spammed with job offers. 

5. Everything romantic will fall into place at this point. You won't have to go to some hook up website, as now you will have your sh*t together and can find a relationship without swiping on people's profiles.

6. That's it. Literally all your problems have been solved.

I'm extremely bored with life but at the same time nothing seems appealing to me 😔 I feel like vanishing into the wild. I can't remember the last time I laughed genuinely. I don't know how to have fun any more. Everytime I try a night out with people, I end up in my head and extremely anxious and I always end up ruining the night. I'm married and have 3 children, 2 from previous relationship. I absolutely adore my wife but at the moment seems like all we do is watch TV and smoke weed. I need to feel some excitement or actually look forward to doing somthing. Life feels bleak at the moment and I feel miserable pretty much everyday unless I'm really busy and distracted.

You can also have a really great solo sex life you can always spice it up with devices.  They make a lot of really nice toys for men.

Hi everyone, very new here and really enjoyed reading through the few posts I saw. I need some advice/support/guidance. I am 31, father of 3, husband, and a pediatric nurse. I have bottlenecked my life into a very female oriented profession. I also used to dance ballet in high school. I have been surrounded by female friends most of my adult life due to my own choices. I find my self so starved of male companionship as of recently. I don’t know what to do anymore. I cannot claim a single male friend, and honestly my current friendship status hardly extends past my wife, whom I adore. I suffer from depression, anxiety, and pretty severe self hate. I have a passive SI. I’m in therapy and I take medications. My request is how do you guys find and maintain friendships, even with the busy-ness of life. I don’t want to feel like an island much longer. Any advice is thoroughly appreciated.	jimborn1314	post	26.40872468679826	female	White	0.0037275177892297506	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth

I  worked fast food, lived in a prison cell flea infested home with a creepy old man during my internship, cleaned boats from sunrise to  sunset, lived in a bed bug infested white trash crackhead house (got scars) where someone drugged me just for a laugh while his dog attacked mine several times, worked with racists in Texas, covid took away that job, lost my dog, then I went to live on a god forsaken island in another prison cell sized apartment that costed $1200 per month despite the shit water seeping from the ground when I flushed (I was making only  $13 per hour), then I came to a new career-launching job as a scuba diver at an Aquarium and got fired in 3 months all cuz my boss didn’t  wanna work harder or change his coaching methods for an autistic worker so he came up with a bullshit reason to fire me. I’ve fought so  hard….and I’ve been single and alone throughout all of it. Minus my dog, but now she's gone...

I have lost… I gave my diving career 8 years of my life…8 fucking years of hard fucking work. I’m tired…and autism makes the human aspect just too hard. I thought I could overcome it, but I can’t fake a personality and hate eye contact. After being fired cuz of it…I’m defeated. I have NOTHING! I'm unemployed now, relying on my savings. I'm still single at age 30 with not ONE woman ever  romantically loving me. I live in a small apartment all alone living in a fucking red state.

Unemployment benefits were REJECTED. I'm a short (5'7"") autistic, loser with an ugly face who has no friends, no lover, NOTHING! I wasted my 20s working so hard to pursue the dreams of a stupid little boy thinking he could overcome any challenge with hard work.

I failed...and now I cross the streets without looking both ways. Hoping for a car to hit me and finish the job so it's not a suicide. What's the point anymore of going on? Not like I have a beautiful woman waiting for me or a dog who needs me to care for her.

"You’re life sounds like it’s been an adventure like mine. I too feel I wasted my 20s and one of the hardest parts of my life is rumination over time lost. I knew time was passing but I didn’t know how valuable it was.

I’m 32 and feel 82 some days, I am so fucking tired. I have had one man treat me somewhat decently and another abusive asshat take years off my life and suck joy from my soul.

I too had no one to rely on me and felt like a worthless loser.l because he always told me I was. I wished I would have been aborted. I should have had my cute humble home and family of my own by now with a loving partner. 

I’ve only recently overcome the despair because both my grandparents suddenly need me to cook and shop and care for them. I moved in and feel purpose, although I am still crushed from time to time since I don’t have the life I thought I would yet.  

 Truly I feel your pain. Rest up, remain hopeful, take it one day at a time. You sound like a fighter with stories to tell. Do what you can now to try to paint the rest of the canvas the way you’d like."	Knightmare560	reply	na	na	na	0.9990347623825073	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"My (24f) fiance's (30m) mental health has slowly started to become something he trusts me enough to help sort through, but I'm only able to give him advice from my perspective.

He has unmedicated ADHD and anxiety, as well as a big fear of failure and rejection. This boy's been through so many things, and none of them determine his worth, but he's just too hard on himself. I have no idea what I could say or do to make him feel better, but him opening up in this way is just such a big deal to me, that I'm scared I'm gonna say the wrong thing unintentionally.

He says he's scared that he's not where his siblings are in life (of which none of them have been through even a fraction of what he's been through) but I can't seem to convince him that he's not them, and what he has in life is a testament to how courageous and lionhearted he is. He's the most spectacular man I've been blessed to have in my life, I just wish he could see himself in the light I see him in.

"For the self comparison I’d try asking him how he measures success for himself, you and he may find that he values success as being healthy and having interests and good relationships for example rather than having a ‘good job’ or large savings account. Then you can help him identify the ways he feels he has achieved success in the way he sees it or the ways he can work towards achieve if his version of success. From what you’ve said he is more successful than most in terms of good morals and emotional strength these things aren’t always as outwardly visible as work and money and arguably much more important.

I would also consider discussing with him how you see and measure success and all the ways in which he demonstrates that.

I wouldn’t be too afraid about saying the wrong thing, try to listen and validate and thank him for trusting, loving and granting you with the privilege of his vulnerability! 

In terms of self esteem it can be impossible to make someone see themselves how you see them. Sometimes reiterating all the positives you see in them can become an endless and unhelpful way to raise someone’s self esteem. you sound like an amazing partner so I’d just continue doing that, continue loving and supporting him and lead by example by loving and supporting yourself and trying to be ask kind and gentle with yourself as you can to influence him positively. Continue praising him for the things you are grateful for that he does and is for you. And a huge one I think with men specifically, is to specifically compliment him in things only he can do and be for you. There can be a tendency to love and praise men for their ability to provide/protect etc, but any man can provide or protect, maybe think on what he does and is for you that no one else could be and let him know those things!"	dorkydorkdork5	reply	na	na	na	0.003858767682686448	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"This is my first post in this subreddit. (32m) My mental health has been declining for years due to so many traumatic events but also improving in the last few years due to a lot of changes made in my life. I have always been the positive one with my peers' family and co-workers. 

I always knew how much my faith has been strong. Some people may think im god because of my faith and spirit.I learned fast that in life, you need to be mentally strong.but I will try to keep this short. My girlfriend and I just found out that she has the early stages of ovarian cancer, and now she has to get treatment before it begins to spread like wildfires. 

We have been together for 3 years we are happy, that's my best friend and now she doesn't even want to live anymore and keeps crying. I feel so bad. She has no kids because of this cancer, but I have two boys from a previous relationship. She loves my kids just like her owe she has been thur so much. 

I can't even imagine what she is going through all the pain and stuffing with more pain to go. My eyes cry for her. To keep seeing all my loved ones hurt sick or even dead. I've been to so many funerals. It's getting so hard to cope with all the trauma. 

The worst is watching all the pain my loved ones are stuffing from. The best part is being there for them. Even right now, I know I must remain strong for her because she will need me. To be mentally tough, in this world as a man, is a challenge because I still stuffer from my own pain"	l0ng_DaDDyjAy304	post	39.033971811544845	male	White	0.00885665975511074	na	na	na	2	malementalhealth
My Great Grandmother was born in 1920 in Mexico and came to the USA later. They lived in tents outside. Her father (my great great grandfather) worked all day and night while my Great great grandmother took care of the kids. When my grandmother was 12 her mother got sick and they were so poor they Dr. Came to see her at her camp and told her she didn’t have long. My Great great grandmother told my great grandmother the truth and said she was going to have to take charge of her mothers duties now cooking cleaning washing clothes in the river bathing her brother. We live in an easier time than they did and as a result we are not as mentally tough as they were but we can acknowledge this and get stronger. This is only one traumatic event in her life. When I am going through something I remember to suck it up because it would shame my ancestors to give up. I even look back at the stories of Moses and many others in the Bible and remember they had to fight for there lives and freedom so I must become stronger.

"I have been to 5 different psychiatrists over the course of 5 years and almost all of them have come up with different mixes of diagnosis's

One says I'm bipolar, some say I have ADHD and Autism, another says it's my dysohoria (which they all agree I do have, so at least there's that) causing mental issues along with autism, another says it's ADHD and Bipolar. 

I got tested for all of these things and the tests say I have ADHD, autism, but also ride the line for bipolar. But because they all have so much overlap, they're unsure. I get it isn't an exact science but I've wasted thousands of dollars trying to get my mental health in check and it seems like I only get road blocks. 

I fucking hate the mental health care system in america. All I want to do is get my brain in order so I can live my life. My mental health has caused me to lose friends, the woman I thought I would marry, and my capability to go to school.

"I am struggling in a lot of different ways. In school I'm very lonely and I feel alienated. I heard that it gets harder to make friends/relationships as you get older and now I'm scared that I never will have friends or be in a relationship. 

What I want most is to have a girlfriend because she can also be like a best friend. Also I'm more comfortable talking to girls because I grew up around them and all my friends I've had in my life were girls. But I feel like that makes me act to feminine and they will only see me as a friend, never boyfriend material. I also worry that when I get older, to get a girlfriend I'm going to need to have lots to offer such as a good job and experience in relationship and so on. I don't understand how getting a gf works at all or where to even start. I thought the only way to get a gf is to be friends with her first so I could really know her but some people say it's manipulative or I will just be friendzone. But I can't cold approach. I also get confused when girls say they like kind, guys who will really love them and treat them right but then they date guys who are the opposite of that I guess because it's more exciting.

"Hey, fellow high functioning autistic guy here that also grew up around women so I'm a bit more effeminate. It gets a little harder when you're older, but not really (at least imo) in school you're stuck around the same women, after school you go to college/work/bars/social activitie.  I only had 1 girlfriend in highschool and tbh it was ok but not my best relationship I've had. Growing up socializing with women more actually will give you an advantage to the guys that only hang out around other guys. Women typically don't socialize like men do, So being able to make friends with women is helpful. 

Having friends that are women is really helpful because they are great as wingmen. Having a woman be your wingman and vouch for you being a nice guy is way more credible than if it came from one of your male friends or yourself. 

The friend to lovers arch can work, but most of the time once women become friends with you you tend to become friend zoned because they only see you as a friend and built a relationship with you as a friend and not as someone they are romantically involved in. Making friends with women and being in a relationship with women required two different types of social skills. 

You can try cold opening, but that requires confidence in yourself and being ok with most likely being shot down. You can also try and see if any of your friends that are women know anyone that you'd vibe well with, maybe set you up on a blind date

I know ""your time will come"" sounds dismissive and like I'm just making something up to make you feel better, but it really will. I met my last long time girlfriend at a college grad party  When you're out of school spend time doing your hobbies, get hobbies that put you in the public. Enev if you like something That's stereotypically ""man hobbies"" like D&D, video games or football there are public table top game places, coed sports/running teams.

"Hi there,

I am sorry to hear that you are going through such a rough time in your life. It can be difficult to make friendships and find a romantic partner whether in school or out of school. I do think that it actually gets easier though because in high school and college there still is a lot of immaturity. Also, I found highschool and college to be very clicky. I had similar struggles as you but have found a few things to be helpful. Find activities you are passionate about and find groups that you can join with the activities. You already have something in common and it can make things easier. Get involved in various activities and explore your passions. The more you do and the more you try to be around people the more likely you will be to meet people and make friends. We naturally try to avoid social activities and groups but that is what we need to do in order to meet people. You are in my thoughts and prayers."	boomboxspence	reply	na	na	na	0.997818112373352	strong	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"u/boomboxspence, thanks for your post and questions.  Getting or finding a GF isn't the right way to pursue it as I've found.  Having a great community of friend and relationships...and then it'll hit you back door and a girl will emerge and become your GF.  Couple of thoughts:  
1)  Join a youth small group at your local church and do life with them.  
2)  Learn to know who you are, what makes you tick and your life's priorities.  
3)  Become the best version of yourself and in the process others (both guy and girl friends) will be drawn to you.  
4)  Stop comparing yourself to others.  While in school, focus on your academics....it's okay to be a nerd.  When you get into college or beyond HS, girls look at guys differently and it's not for looks, it's more for guys with ambition, know who they are, and have direction in their lives.  
5)  A couple of things to work towards...4 simple but very difficult to do:  
1-	**Be Impeccable with Your Word** Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.   
2-	**Don't Take Anything Personally** Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own dream.   
3-	**Don't Make Assumptions** Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.   
4-	**Always Do Your Best** Your best changes from moment to moment; Your best is different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Simply do your best under any circumstance to avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret."	boomboxspence	reply	na	na	na	0.997818112373352	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"My life has been pretty much desolate and mediocre since I was in middle school. Nothing is going on, nothing is happening, I have no redeeming qualities or talents or anything. I knew the moment I realized that I was a loser in school that my life was ruined.

It sounds silly and dumb as hell I know, but high school is gone. It’s over, I’ll never get those years back ever and have a chance to redeem them. It’s all a total failure for me. No walking with my classmates down to the local deli for pizza slices and hanging out after class, joining clubs and after school activities having fun while building up my social skills, doing dumb and fun shit with my friends in class, nervously chatting with the cute girl in class and making plans with her after school, texting my friends and crush until late into the night, no attending rallies or going to prom or house parties, and just being a normal fucking teenager with a normal fucking life like everyone else. All of those things are gone and I’ll never get them again. I was bullied and cast aside in school. Nobody liked me, I was literal gutter trash as ugly as a dead pig that nobody with even the slightest amount of awareness or reputation would ever associate with. I wasted all those opportunities and moments being a fucking loser. I don’t care how petty or “peaked in high school” it sounds, but I was robbed. Plainly and simply robbed. I desperately wanted to have a normal school life and experiences. I so goddamn fucking wanted desperately to be accepted and appreciated by my peers and to have a normal social and romantic development like everyone else. I just wanted a normal life like everyone else. I’m actually fucking devastated and depressed over this and I’ll never recover or forgive myself. I can’t watch romance movies or play dating sims anymore because they literally make me spiral and collapse. I destroyed my mind, soul and life before it even began. Everyone else gets to move on with their lives knowing that they had a great time in school being a normal person. I fucking ruined everything. I wanted to be a normal person with a normal upbringing, and I messed it all up. 

If I asked any normal person, they would say it was all 100% my fault for how I was treated for being a weirdo and not conforming with everyone and talking with people, and that it means I deserve to be lonely and miserable for the rest of my life for missing out. THEY got through just fine and everyone was nice and good to them, and anyone who was alone and ostracized deserved it.

At this point, I’m too old for college and the normal social experience there. It’s pretty much over. Everyone has grown up and is living a socially, romantically and sexually boosted life they’ve natural life cultivated since they were teens. Nobody wants or cares about the overgrown 15 year old who has never gotten laid or hasn’t had a single memory or story to tell in decades. I’m spending my miserable time punishing and cursing myself for being autistic, ugly, untalented, and never succeeding at anything in my entire life.

"Therapy will be powerful and helpful for you.
There’s also a lot of YouTube channels on integrating into life as well. Seek up people like healthygamergg (also has life coaching program), various coverage of Carl Jung, or happiness trap book also on YouTube in audio form— highly suggested. And Andrew huberman on brain health.

Agreed about developing social norms and habits that gives you continual growth is important. However, that can be learned after your early 20s.

Lots of people went through trauma, either through sexual assault, mental abuse, tragedy, and many other aspects in life where they couldn’t develop social skills. A lot of people just work hard dead end jobs and go straight home just making a living to survive. Many can’t adapt but there’s also many who found there way and try things in life to adapt. Lonliness is also an EPIDEMIC in North America. You’re not alone and there’s some solace in that. A lot of people just barely survived in their 20s and social media portrays very small portion in society where it’s all fun and growth. ITS NOT. 

What’s also important is to work and save money. That’s what most people do.

Awareness is important. And that just takes trying different things in life. Therapy really helps, because it helps you move on from the past away from that downward spiral thinking that is depression (upward spiral is a great book too)

Find small things you enjoy daily or weekly monthly. Keep at it. Have goals. Maybe it’s traveling maybe it’s hobbies that let’s you be social. If you’re under 30. You’re still VERY YOUNG. And can still start experiencing life. Working on your mental health and letting go of your past is takes a lot of work. Start now.

Take a trip and make memories. Even if you’re scared. You just got to take action. And create momentum.

Hang in there. Mental health takes a lot of maintanence. A daily practice. Exercise rigorously everyday to give yourself a routine and progression. It’s core to mental health."		reply	na	na	na	0.9994297623634338	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"So, y’all indulge me for a second. I’m a very pious person. Norse pagan, grew up with a tough family etc etc. Having parents, and arguably a belief system that idolizes strength and character has helped me some. But my confidence is a double edged sword. Let me give you and example 

So, I went to vegas recently. I bought jewelry (only 300 bucks worth, nothing too real but it looked real yk?). I was confident in them when I first traveled. When I got there, I got super insecure about the jewelry because no one else had on anything else flashy. But my brain does that with EVERYTHING. Oh you talked a girl? Well what did you do wrong? You got a haircut? Oh yeah you look nice but people probably still think you’re ugly. 

In turn I loathe even more because on a spiritual level, I’m not supposed to be cowardly at all. But I don’t have a “stop being socially anxious” switch. Thoughts?"	Accomplished_Way_693	post	31.19107150308113	female	White	0.9977660179138184	na	na	na	3	malementalhealth
I had a similar issue although not exactly the same. I would try to convince myself that there was nothing to be anxious about, and sometimes I would find temporary success.

"This isn’t cowardice, friend. It’s just insecurity, and it can be chronic/related to something like depression, not an inherent trait. I have body dysmorphia and it causes many of those thoughts - “I look strange / I stand out / I’m too fat” etc. Even about my abilities, like thoughts that I’m not good enough, unskilled, awkward etc. 

Some of these are intrusive thoughts and some are true insecurity. Both are addressed differently. Each time: ask yourself why you think it’s odd/ugly/etc? Has anyone ever told you that, or is it only your own brain saying it? Even if nobody else around you is wearing flashy stuff, does that make it bad? Stuff like that. You really have to challenge yourself. 

Personally I find it helpful to treat those thoughts like it’s my little brother saying it. Like ok, thanks, shut up now kid. You wouldn’t take that shit from a kid, so don’t take it from your brain either."	Accomplished_Way_693	reply	na	na	na	0.9977660179138184	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"I'm 21, graduated university last summer, and am still job seeking while living off left over money. I was born into a mess of a family (namely to a father that has damaged my mother in unspeakable ways). I alongside the rest of the family estranged from him a few years ago.

I found out some more specifics about him recently that left me shaking with rage. However, one thing that doesn't seem beyond reasonable doubt is that he's paranoid in some way. He for whatever reason decided he has cancer with no formal diagnosis. He said to my mum the doctors would kill him after she offered to go with him to them.

One time when my mum saw him looking angry for no apparent reason, he said ""I don't know why I do this. I think there's something wrong with me"". After he sold his takeaway (around the time I was born, maybe a bit before), he stopped going to work for years. Apparently his average day was sleeping the entire day, watching TV all night or being out somewhere all night (who knows where). 

A month or two before I was born, he called mum while she was in hospital. His mum told him some bullshit about mine. I'm guessing she claimed my mum was being unfaithful (which in reality is a dumb claim because she was hardly allowed to go anywhere and I doubt she'd have had any interest whatsoever in relationships after her experiences) and that set him off. He was so vexed by whatever he was told that he said he was going to kill himself (he didn't off himself). 

To me he quite literally sounds mentally ill. If he is, it's clear nothing was ever dealt with. I don't know what made him into who he is. His relationship with his father was described as a bit distant (as far as my mum could tell, there wasn't hatred, they'd have their arguments but it doesn't sound like anything more than not agreeing on some things). 

His father died about 30 years ago, my father was 26 at the time. I don't know how that affected him. He's only ever mentioned his father to me on one occasion: when we watched his wedding tape 11 years ago when my grandfather was on camera. My mum described my father basically as a mummy's boy, listening to everything she said. Maybe she was controlling. I never liked his mother (haven't seen his side of the family for nearly ten years). 

Why do I wonder about inheriting mental health problems? Well, my life satisfaction has been low for a long time. I have plenty of days where I'm pissed off, where I can't be bothered with anything and just want to sleep. Can't be bothered to explain why my worldview is far from positive (one thing is not believing in Islam while being in a Muslim family), but many different things leave me disenchanted. Sometimes I have villainous and violent thoughts stemming from anger. I feel no sense of home in this world, no real connection.

I went to therapy for a bit last summer. I don't know how much it helped. I found it frustrating sometimes - didn't always feel understood. Plus, just talking didn't feel like enough. Deep down I want a certain comfort (long story short, I daydream about being cocooned with some kind of nurturing presence)."	6ETTIN_BUCK	post	21.407079414139083	male	White	0.996515154838562	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth
"What you’re going through is very normal for someone who was raised under such stressful circumstances. 

Talk therapy can be very effective for some, but even for those who it does work for, it’s not enough. 

I imagine you have some neglect in your past given what you’ve described if not outright abuse. 

Our nervous systems don’t develop properly under long term stress throughout childhood. 

Slow, rhythmic movements can do wonders to re-regulate the physical side; think tai chi, Jiujitsu, yoga, rock climbing, dancing; even just dancing badly / wiggling around like a weirdo in the kitchen listening to your favourite music. 

Singing also is beneficial. 

Then there’s the aggression; anger on its own is healthy; it’s our alarm system that says *something isn’t right here* and interpersonally anger says *it os not okay for you to treat me like this*.

It becomes dangerous and harmful when we suppress it and try to ignore and don’t process it; 

You need an outlet like chopping wood, running, shouting into your pillow, get a punching bag, cry it out. Whatever works. 

Depending on where you live there are places called Smash Rooms where you get to go wear safety gloves and boots and smash some shit to pieces. 

For the mental part; writing long hand has been proven very affective; and then you can keep it or you can shred it up with your hands or even watch it burn for extra catharsis. 

You can write what about what happed, what you’ve been told, what you wish should have happened, what pisses you off, etc. anything that comes to mind; pay no attention to grammar, or spelling just write and write and let it out.

Physiologically this process shifts your brain from carrying these painful memories in our short term working memory and helps them get re-filed into our long term memory. Which is the goal of healing.

And take it slow; don’t try to heal and fix everything all at once. Start small and work your way up."	6ETTIN_BUCK	reply	na	na	na	0.996515154838562	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"Hello guys , I really need your help , I'm writing this here as I ran out of options any advice will be greatly appreciated.

I'm a 25 year old male coming from a lower class family from a 3rd world country , I'm not financially independent and I never was throughout my life , I failed myself and my family too many times , they're actually very lovely and caring they spent a huge amount of their life savings to enroll me in a private university , I'm supposed to be preparing my end of studies project by now but I have literally just stopped functioning months ago , I have shown various symptoms of anxiety and depression disorders throughout my life since 2019 I save a little money now and then to talk to a professional and they mostly try to force medication on me and I was never convinced with that , last week after spending 3 months avoiding any responsibility I have , I had a sudden wake up call but all the time and opportunities I missed for no absolute reason sent me into total panic and I still can't function , I went to two different therapists with some little money I saved and they both said that I suffer from depression , that it's getting worse and my only way out is medication,

I refused it at first , but yesterday I started my first dose of antidepressants and it made me feel unbearable for the rest of the day , highly agitated , easily irritated and I couldn't control myself that I had to leave the house and wander the streets late at night for some time for my family not to notice anything , I talked to my therapist about it that maybe the dose (10mg) is a bit too high for me or that maybe the medication is simply not for me but she insisted that I take it and she prescribed me with more medication ( anxiolytics ) to go with my antidepressants I couldn't afford any more therapeutic sessions nor medication on my own , I don't know if I should tell my family for fear that I might scare them or that they might not understand and blame me for taking the decision on my own , and also out of fear that they might support me financially just so I can let them down once again, I'm a very discrete person especially when it comes to my problems I always try to deal with them in silence to protect my surroundings but now things are simply getting out of hand,  I'm at a crossroad in my life where any decision I may take can be my salvation or simply my doom , I'm going through extreme stress levels that I've never experienced before in my life and I'm writing this as a last resort ( note : I'm not at risk of harming myself or any others around me , I'm fully aware of my actions ) any insight would be greatly appreciated and I invite you to be as honest as you can even if it means hurting my feelings.

Thank you in advance :)"	JustayRandomDUDE	post	25.039070636925914	male	White	0.49221253395080566	na	na	na	2	malementalhealth
"Antidepressants have a tendency to throw you for a loop the first time you take them. Good on you for going for them and giving them a chance. As far as I know it's normal to feel bad for the first days, even weeks. They start to have positive effects after prolonged intake and after your body adjusts to them. So I'd say to trust your doctor and if they don't settle down after a month or two mention it again to them. Cause that's when it's more likely that it's just not the right one for you. On The financial aspect I  don't know what would be helpful... I think if you have supportative parents it's not a bad idea of bringing it up to them that you are getting professional help. Mentioning that it's professional is good cause thay conveys that you are doing the right steps.

Perhaps find a way to introduce such clients to massage with their clothes on? I would LOVE a back massage without the worry of doing it shirtless!

"As previous statements, I (21M) am an incel. I have to disclose that i got enlightened on some aspects of inceldom, like, as you can see, basically every person who self identyfied as one always start saying ""im an incel but i am not a hateful person"" and thats true. And look, im one since r /braincels were still a thing

I started as just a lost guy wandering on the internet and wondering why i never got to experience normal teenage things like teenage romance and shit (and no matter what you say, every normal person had a teen romance or at least a teen girlfriend/boyfriend)

And you know why the blackpill is so addictive? Cause it is true, thats why every incel has things in common, shortness, ugly baldness, framelet. And although it can make me feel the want to change ourselves, it dont work at all. 

Im currently at 3 months from going to the gym for 2 years and you know what? Right now im already decided on not going anymore, after all, it actually didnt help me one bit on leaving inceldom so theres actually no need to do it (no i dont care about my health at all) 

Things that didnt help either were therapy (oh yeah i want so much to get to a total stranger and say ""hey i want to kill myself everyday because i cant find a girlfriend"" and i bet the stranger will try and help me get one instead of trying to put that ""you need to love yourself"" shit into my head. I hate myself, and this hate grows every SINGLE DAY, CAUSE IM REMINDED EVERY TIME THAT YOUNGER PEOPLE ALREADY HAVE IT BETTER!)

Oh yeah i love to hear my cousin say that i have it so good since i dont have to deal with breakups. Yeah i like to know a girl threatened to cut her wrists cause my nephew didnt want to kiss her. OH YEAH I JUST LIKE BEING MOGGED TO OBLIVION BY EVERY GUY WHO I MEET. YES I LOVE IT, CANT YOU SEE? I LOVE BEING LESS THAN TRASH.

Also when i say gym did bullshit to me people tend to think i know little about it. I SPENT HOURS WATCHING BODYBUILDERS PODCASTS ON STRATEGIES TO GAIN MASS. I WATCHED HOURS OF TIPS FOR BEGGINNERS. the only thing i didnt do was steroids and thats just because i couldnt find any way to get them easily. Heart attack at 22? COUNT ME IN

Uglyness wont go away with self improvements. If you have an ugly face and is short its simply game over. I wish my mom had been successful in aborting me cause i would be better off dead

And before people coming rushing to say personality shit, guess what? In school i had a lot of friends who were girls, but of course none found me attractive, and no one ever will. ""But but statistics say that..."" Bullshit, with Tinder, good looking guys can AND WILL pull 3, 4, 5, 10 girls at the same time, ensuring that they wont SETTLE DOWN for someone like me. Spending time with friends just makes me have to put on a mask of my past self that was lead to believe that love would happen when youre not looking for it, another bullshit, as you can see by chadfishing on Tinder. Also talking about Tinder, 2 years use, no conversations ever.

No, clubs dont work, parties dont work. The only thing who can solve my problems now is the barrel of a 12 gauge AND THIS FUCKING JOKE OF A COUNTRY HAS GUN LAWS! The fucking country with the highest absolute number of homicides HAS GUN LAWS. 

In conclusion. Do not ever look into your problems cause you might discover they are unfixable for a poor person and youll start hating yourself so much that just remembering how NAIVE AND DUMB you were to believe everyone would find love would make you hate yourself even more.

BRO!

There is a LOT of hate and venom in your words. The title of your post is quite correct, and you're saturated with it.

I was hesitant to comment because I know the first thing you're going to want to do is lash out at anyone trying to help you.

Instead, I'm not going to help you.

I'll give you a brief summary of what happened to me.

Couldn't get laid. Went to the gym. Got jacked because ""bitches love a jacked dude"". Realized there's only so much muscle genetics will allow me to put on.

Got an average girl on Tinder. Was more lonely and desperate than anything. Ended up being... Not a bad relationship, but we definitely didn't fit right.

Anyway, started doing Brazilian Jiu-jitsu. Got stronger than I ever was just lifting. Suddenly the flashbacks and PTSD from years of bullying were gone.

Realized ""Oh, I am not longer putting off subliminal 'kick me, Im a victim' signs that everyone picks up on"".

Got an amazing girlfriend and the only reason we broke up was she wants a family and I don't.

Started using psychedelics, realized losing her was an error. Oh well. Started to *embrace* who I really am which is a semi-shy dude who loves nerdy things and Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and unapologetic of all that I do.

Now I'm just single because lack of options.

Also, stay the fuck off the apps. The male to female ratio is 9:1 and it's EASY for women especially to decide ""Nah, there's A FLAW I don't like with this one. Oh well. Several hundred more to choose from"".

That was my journey. Maybe you can try some of the stuff I did. Or just sit in your stew of hatred and embrace the poison of the incel reddit thread. I can't tell you what to do. 

But damn is it hard to watch people take the easy path of hatred. I do get why though."	SsRapier	reply	na	na	na	0.9987766146659851	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"Dude after looking at your pictures I can confidently say you’re an incel because of your AWFUL attitude. You are so miserable and it OOZES out of every word you’ve written on this thread. Even your face pic screams misery. You didn’t even bother to smile. How can somebody be attracted to a person that can’t even be bothered to smile for a picture? Open your eyes more and put on a happy face, it’s not hard. You know it’s not hard, but you don’t want to. 

I am willing to bet money that the reason girls avoid you like the plague is because you look like you’re going to kill them. Nobody wants to be around a person that is so angry and hateful. Your appearance has nothing to do with that. Your physique is nice, you’re not ugly in the face, and your hair is fine. It’s your HORRIBLE attitude. Your therapist was right, but you’re so invested in your own misery that you can’t see it. It’s like being miserable is your whole identity.

"Dude you're not even ugly, definitely average, but not ugly. I've seen guys WAY uglier than you having girlfriends. You have a good body too, 10x better than my body and i go to the gym somewhat regularly, obviously the gym is helping how you look. But then again I know plenty of women that would prefer a guy with a great personality and a ""dad bod"" over the guy with a muscles body and an incel/blackpill mindset. You could be the hottest dude on the planet and have the mindset of an incel and NEVER get a girlfriend, maybe get laid, but no woman wants a guy that's blackpilled. 

This  has to be a thing with the way you're approaching and talking to women, or you're approaching women out of your league. 

Get your confidence up (yes this includes self love) if you're confident in youself you won't feel so bad if you get shot down, so you'll shoot your shot more. Get off incel forums, you say they're addicting and negative so start going on them less and less. If you don't like how your hair looks, get a good curl routine. A curl routine is important with curly hair, especially if you want it to look ""good"". If you're good at making friends that are women, ask one of them to be your ""wingman"". One of my best wingmen post breakup is one of my female friends, if a woman is vouching for you being a ""good guy"" it comes off as way more genuine, cuz when a guy says ""I'm a good guy"" that's a huge red flag for women. 

Tinder is a HORRIBLE way to gauge how many women are actually attracted to you. It is literally a proven fact that unless you pay for Tinder as a man, they hide most of your likes from you and hide you from the women you like to get you to pay. I probably get a match on there 4-7x a week tops, and swipe on like 5 women a day. I paid for a month of tinder on a prepaid visa just to see if it would change things and DAMN, when they say ""99+ likes"" in that one section, they mean it (depending on the size of the city you live in). I had never seen any of those women on my feed and they had all swiped right. Unless you're a objective 8-10, you're not gonna get many likes on dating apps."

"I used to be an incel. I almost committed suicide in college.

But I found something that saved me. I started paying for sex and dates. After a while, I learned how to talk to women and get dates normally. In addition, making a woman cum will significantly boost your confidence outside the bedroom. So maybe you can try that. There’s nothing wrong with paying for sex. Men have been doing it for millennia. If Mother Nature gave you a bad genetics draw for looks, you gotta compensate somehow. 💰

A few other things that helped me:

alcohol - If you’re shy or introverted, alcohol can make you more social. I usually do two shots before a date in order to become extroverted. And then I usually have a beer, cocktail, or another shot during the date, depending on how much my partner drinks. Match what she drinks, unless you’re hitting it off, in which case other whatever you want. Also, learn how to make drinks and keep a home bar.  

weed - This is useful for when you bring someone back to your place. I usually ask, “Do you smoke or anything?” then go from there. I prefer edibles, but some people prefer smoking 

fashion - learn how to dress! If you’re not fat, be sure to wear non-baggy clothes. It’s alway better to wear clothes that are too small rather than too big. If you are fat, lose weight. Also, shoes. It took me a while to realize this, but women care a lot about shoes. I made the mistake of thinking “lol, women aren’t gonna look at my feet!” Wrong! They do look. At a minimum, your shoes shouldn’t look dirty and they should match the rest of your clothes. Always wear shoes that make you taller, like Doc Martens. Finally, if you need fashion advice, check Instagram or Tik Tok.

autism - if you’re on the spectrum, as I am, learn about autistic habits. Work on your eye contact, don’t ramble, don’t fidget, etc.

health - obviously, shower before your date. Brush your teeth, especially if you take the alcohol advice. Wear deodorant. Wear cologne or body spray. Doesn’t matter which brand. Axe does work, despite claims to the contrary 

sex - learn how to put on a condom quickly. Always keep a condom in your wallet. Always keep condoms near your bed. Always engage in foreplay before sex. Always go down on your partner. Be sure she cums! Learn how to loosen a bra quickly. It requires a slight pinch.

clubs - clubs do work. But you have to drink first. Never ever go into a club sober. My usually strategy is get tipsy first. If I see a woman at the bar, I’ll offer to buy her a drink. Otherwise, I’ll just go to the dance floor and dance. Just let things happen. If you seem to be enjoying yourself, women will kinda just end up near you. It’s weird.

conversation - ask questions. Make the conversation about her, but don’t let it feel like a job interview. Don’t talk too much about yourself; be a little mysterious. Unless she’s a nerd, don’t talk about nerdy things, no matter how much you like them. No anime, video games, Star Trek, or any of that shit. However, philosophy, international politics, media, current events, and history are totally okay. Avoid politics if you’re a Republican. Don’t go on political rants.

Even if a guy that looks like you can’t ever find a woman who ur attracted to that feels the same is there really nothing else to enjoy in this world?

This may not be much help OP, but I believe you're misunderstanding what a relationship is. Regardless of what movies, media, society, and celebrities may have you believe, relationships are not about sex, clout, or children, they're about love. And love is pretty blind. I am a fat (probably obese), short (5'2), and relatively unattractive person (never had anyone show intrest in my from my appearance alone). My only redeeming trait in my eyes was that I have the personality of a golden retreiver, sickeningly positive and borderline annoying, but I like people. I met my girlfriend online, not through a dating app, but through a game we both like playing. We were friends for a good 5 years before we got together, and she had a crush on me for a long time, even though she only found out what I looked like a month after we got together. In fact that was how I met most of my ex-partners, online through hobby spaces where people could appreciate me for me and not what I looked like. It's different for everyone though. My stepdad is shorter than my mom and met her at a mall, my best friend is shorter than me and he met his girlfriend through work. Life is pretty weird. But always remember that misery loves company. I'm not gonna sit here and tell you to change your personality/appearance/outlook/etc, but I definitely beleive that you'd have it much better in distancing yourself from the incel community. Any fringe community built on negativity and hate will absolutely love bringing others down to their level much like a cult, until you start to see everything their way. Before you know it, you've cut your own shoes before the race could even start, all because they convinced you that you never had a chance. I saw your picture, you're attractive and I'm certain that given time, you'll find someone perfect for you. Regardless of what incels may say, treating other humans kindly and being friendly is far more valued than appearance in everything from relationships to careers. Finding a small, positive support system of friends can do wonders, better than therapy at times. Try r/bropill.	SsRapier	reply	na	na	na	0.9987766146659851	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

Now they all have certain thoughts on what that one family member that doesn't even think therapy does anything. My perspective is that the current state that specific family member is in is one that they are content with living inside. Why else would they not seek support of any kind from anyone?

"I'm sorry your life has been hard. However think about how loneliness and hate are two different things. 

To hate someone you have to think: this is their fault. And it's not, is it? 

If I like a guy and he doesn't like me back, I'm not angry with him. Bc he can't help not liking me that way. It's not his fault.

I think also you hate yourself a lot and you don't need to. Your value as a person isn't if you have a girlfriend or not or how well you do on Tinder. It's about being a good person, that's what makes someone worthwhile. It doesn't necessarily get you dates, but it's how you should measure your worth.

Then I think a big part of it is how you feel the way things are right now are the way they'll stay forever. I know plenty of guys who were incurably single in high school and their early twenties, but found great relationships later. It's often just about being lucky enough to run into the right person.

"yes and that's true that mean's mental health isn't talked about enough or ""socially acceptable"" enough yet. but when women say it, it's out of fear for their safety or life it's because they have either been assaulted, raped, stalked, harassed, or abused, or know someone who has.  if you are not afraid for the same reasons (abuse happens to all genders), you're probably afraid or rejection, loneliness, family pressure, etc. which are legitimate problems that deserve to be addressed, but they are not as brutal as literal beatings, rapes, and murders. therefore garnering different levels of support reactions from different people. finding a local support group or fun events for singles  may help!"

"It's seen as a different situation because with women you assume they are talking about feeling physically unsafe. Women are a lot smaller than men and many have already experienced sexual harassment or assault. 

With men they'll assume that it's more of a social anxiety or insecurity thing by default. Since men are bigger than women and it's more rare that men are sexually harassed and assaulted than women. If that's not the right interpretation of your situation, I think just explain it better to the people you are talking to. People often jump to conclusions.

As a side note I don't think ""be confident"" is a great thing to tell someone with social anxiety. It's better advice to tell them to seek out a good therapist and work on the issue.

Edit: point is just that people just think simply. They will go for the most common explanation. So if I posted ""I'm a girl who's insecure about my weight"" I'd get weight loss tips.

The fear of failure and ridicule looms over me so much. I can’t drive because I’m afraid of other cars and I’m so self conscious about what other drivers think of my driving. I don’t trust myself to have a job because I can’t get past the idea that someone is paying me to do something that I don’t feel like I’m doing good enough to warrant being paid. Even going downstairs and interacting with my family is painful because I feel like a complete loser doing nothing all day, trapped in my room and living off of my parents money. I have like no irl friends anymore cause they all moved away for college, I just feel like the way the world works wasn’t made for me and I don’t belong here. I legitimately think I won’t make it past the age of 30 at this rate given my health and mental state, either my lazy lifestyle kills me or I kill myself later on. I have like no human connections anymore, I don’t talk to anyone outside of sending memes and shit. I’m so scared of taking responsibility of things because I have no trust in myself to do a good job even though I’m a legal adult. Being a man doesn’t help much either.

"It’s not unusual for a person to think they’re doing worse than they actually are. Some of us are pessimistic, others have limiting beliefs lurking: I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy – progress is just luck, setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.

### Consider these positive signs:

· **You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviours. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes

· **You’re clear on what you want – and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

· **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. 

· **You’re making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

·**You’re not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others.

· **You’re committed.** You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.

· **You consider other’s opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. 

· **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.

· **You’re authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.

When you’re clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and you’re spending your time wisely, you’re doing well – and better than most! This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

**Genuine Desire + Effective Strategy + Consistent Persistence = Authentic Results**

"Good evening, people. 

I debate things in my head as a distraction method. Occasionally it doesn't work out and I get stuck on something I would rather not be thinking about, but this question feels pretty harmless in my head and I came to my own conclusion.

I don't think it's controversial to say that certain types of mental illnesses have been romanticised in the past decade or so. People's experiences with them are different which I try to keep in mind, but I can't help struggling to believe a large number of people I've met that claim to have mental health issues. I get the impression that many people exaggerate or are faking it completely as they see it as some sort of romantic illness. 

If you disagree with my assessment then I'd also like to know, but if you agree then I'm curious if you agree whether or not feigned mental health problems or a negative or a positive. 

In favour, I feel the stuff in our heads is taken more seriously by society just based on the numbers. We may have been heading that way regardless given how bad the world is, but I can pretty much talk to a doctor now without feeling like I won't be shrugged off. 

On the other hand, there's a history of people being shrugged off and if people with decent mental health think there are people exaggerating their problems then that might exacerbate that. 

For the record, just depression for myself. I'm English and have been able to pretty much request specific medication from doctors because they don't understand it, but still take it seriously. I fall into the ""Net Positive,"" section of my poll, despite my suspicions about a lot of people that claim poor mental health.

"Well, here I am.

I've been bouting with anxiety and depression for a long time, but there is something I never really talked about to anyone. It's about my size. I know that according to stats it should be in perfect average (17 cm), but many of the women I've slept with off handedly remarked that that was no way the real average because they usually date larger man. Infact, turned out that the Italian average is quite a bit higher.

Anyway, since those instances I've started developing an intense anxiety about sex, something I already lived badly because of performance anxiety etc. In time I stopped dating altogether, I even stopped masturbating and finding other human beings attractive.For a short period I had this weird online thing with a girl from abroad, who probably had very similar insecurities as me. She never showed me her face and was extremely private about her appearance BUT she we were into one another she insisted at least sexting and sharing nudes with me.I tried to take pictures of myself but as I did I felt so ashamed because it looked so tiny that I stopped right there and quitted that relationship too.

I’m a super skinny white dude probably about 5’9 , no tone you can see my rib cage and I’m just good to my woman and it works. You gotta turn up bro that meat is above average , and while most girls have been with bigger (if they’ve been with 4+ men) , a lot of girls haven’t and a lot of girls are cool with even 5 inches	NadiaBlueWater	reply	na	na	na	0.9924660921096802	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
Female here ✋️ I Initially clicked on this post because my husband of 15 years has similar insecurities. But ad far as I can tell, they come from watching porn, which of course mostly shows men of bigger proportion. You know what I tell him? Those look like they would hurt! He is the average size, if not a bit bigger, and I thoroughly enjoy being with him. It isn't all about the size! When you have a true, intimate connection with someone, it feels amazing to share that intimacy. Plus, a females g spot is about an inch or so inside the vagina, so why do you need more than the average. If you know what you're doing to pleasure your partner, you don't have to worry about size.

"I've been trying to break up with my partner for a while now. It takes me so much energy to have the talk. At the moment of the talk, she cries and doesn't want to break up, but by the end of the day, she realizes that this is best for us.
We go our separate ways, she goes to her bed and I to mine.
And the next morning, she pretends nothing happened.

We moved abroad together, kinda are stuck here.
The past few months, she's been dropping hints of not wanting to exist (but she is not suicidal).
During our relationship, she has always been really dependant on me, to the point that I am fairly certain she doesn't know how to do the laundry. Let alone thongs like taxes.

I cannot just up and leave, that is physically impossible.
I am at a loss and don't know what to do.
It's not that I don't love her anymore, although the spark is gone. It's just that I am not in a good space, mentally. And I am bad for her in many ways, and I hold her back with all my issues. She's not ideal for me either, though.
But she's afraid of being alone. And that is one of the main motivators for her to not break up.

"That’s a difficult situation to be in. Looking at the relationship you feel the connection you initially had is gone and you’re both a detriment to each other. You know what it would take for things to work but you don’t have it in you. You know there’s no future the way things are but at the same time you can’t bare to leave her to fend for herself. You still care so much for her despite the situation you’re in. I think that’s a really deep connection the two of you share.

If I were in your situation I’d plan a night out with just the two of us. I’d try to make it more intimate or romantic to really show how much I love her. Tell her all the things you see in her and the nice things you did together. But also tell her how much pain I’m in and all the things I’m concerned about. I’d want her to understand that even though I care for her so much, staying together is not an option due to circumstances. I’d tell her I have to leave, but I’d stay by her side until she can calm down even if it took the entire night. 

I’m a corny kind of guy and I don’t know if this is what you would want to do, but I think you should find a way to show her how much you care. Its a beautiful thing to care for someone more than yourself it would be a shame to bury it underneath the grief and distress without letting her see the rawness of it. There’s no shame in doing what you got to do, but maybe you could be a helping hand along the way for her as your lives continue to unravel? Just a thought."

"I've been where you are, 20 long years ago ... the road is long, young padawen, but remember; certainty is for the dull of wit and slow of mind.

People are rarely certain, until they are.

The trick is to carry on into uncertainty while learning to enjoy the journey.

You're still young, you have not yet leaned this parlour trick, but don't too hard on yourself; those you see who appear so certain are either dim witted or lying to themselves. 

You're smart, so you're already ahead of one group; and let me tell you far better to face down this uncertainty and forge a life now, while you are young, than to wake up in your 40's one day and wonder how the fuck you got there.

Just like it got better in highschool things will get better again & they will also get worse & then better again. I’ve been where you are & now that I am in my 40s I understand that happiness  is fleeting. It just is. As someone who struggles with anxiety uncertainty of the future at times can be debilitating but it can also be exciting. You still have your whole adult life ahead of you. Anything can happen & that makes life interesting. Instead of looking at things from the perspective of nothing is going right for me I might as well just end it try understanding that the human experience is a mix of light & darkness. It isn’t about happiness or your profession, academics & social life. It’s an accumulation of experiences both positive & negative that lead to wisdom.  Life is short so why not take it all in. The good, the bad. The light & the darkness. Experience it all. Eventually you will see that hard times are necessary to grow & evolve as a person. Looking back now I am glad for it all. All these experiences make a life fully lived. When things aren’t going well for me now I try to stay really present in the moment. All day I tell myself to just be here now & not think about the future. It takes practice but it helps to get thru the tough times. Best of luck to you.

"The cool part about losing all sense of self and hitting absolute rock bottom (for reasons other than self-destructive addiction)...

You have nowhere to go but up from your current position. You have no obligations to anyone or anything, so you may choose how you wish to rebuild yourself.

If you can't think of what path you want to take, try this exercise...

Think about a hypothetical version of yourself at 75+ years old. This version of yourself has tried and failed at dozens of things until he found something that worked for him to live a happy life. This version of you is more eccentric, fully self-realized, confident, and just a cool person to hang out with. What is this version of you like? How does he dress? What are his daily habits? How does he decorate and maintain his home? How would he handle conflict and adversity? How would he deal with sudden problems?

I feel insignificant and useless because I have made mistakes in my life, which are entirely my fault. I take full personal responsibility, no blaming on women or on capitalism or other such thing  so this is why i hate myself. I feel that I won't achieve anything remarkable in my life and will forever be stuck in an average, low-paying job. As I get older, I'm losing hope of achieving something remarkable. I want to write machine learning algorithms, explore space and the secrets of nature, become a millionaire, and escape the 9-5 routine. I also want to feel intimacy from women without having to pay for it. As time goes on, it seems that achieving these things becomes less and less possible.  I feel like I am 100% replaceable by AI, and I hate my paralegal internship, where I have to review crappy contracts and lawsuits. It's clear that ML engineers and scientists bring much more value than what i do. However, this is my only source of income, so I can't quit.  What am I doing to change my situation? I'm learning front-end development part-time, but my progress is slow, and even building basic JavaScript projects is torture, let alone complex web apps that could get me hired. Beginner-level web development jobs are oversaturated, so it's nearly impossible to get hired without some experience or a degree in 2023. Nobody will want an incompetent, self-taught code monkey meanwhile myfriend with CS degrees and impressive(at least for me)  angular projects cant get hired for half of year. On the other hand, going back to college for a math or CS degree and hoping to become an ML developer seems very risky. Since high school, I was terrible at solving math problems even now i am zero at elementary college algebra but you have to know calculus and linear algebra for this stuff, and if I graduate at 28, I'll have decades of gap while other math-savvy children will gain years of experience and be at their peak. Meanwhile, I'll be the oldest junior. I don't want to be left with college debt in case of failing. I hate myself for choosing a law degree five years ago , and I hate myself for being incompetent at attracting women since i missed out teen love no one want inexperienced socially incompetent  male . I have suicidal and self-harm thoughts for example i always imagine how i scratch myself with knife but i wont do it for sake of my   mom .

"Wondering if anyone here has the same experience as me, the reason I am asking this, as with many I have been struggling with various mental health problems. I have major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder; this is from my understanding my psy have not actually given me a proper diagnosis but getting treatments And more importantly, I have ADHD, which I also getting treatments for,. I have done a lot and a lot of readings, to understand what is wrong with me, I know I am no doctor to self diagnose, but as much as I would like to get treatments, I would like to know what I am being treated for. I mean I am sure most of you can understand, if you break you legs, thus you get a pain in your leg, the doc will treat you for your broken leg. But like more many of us, I don’t know what I am being treated for, expect “there is something wrong with me “

I have been on medication for sometime, and I am trying to get around the main cause of my issues, right now I am leaning towards These are medication that I have been on

1. Quetiapine aka Seroquel; the box did not say Seroquel though. It said Quetiapine Effects: Did not like it as it made me a zombie, made my anxiety worst, which in turn made my depression worst. But the psy back just kept upping my dosage, over and over again. I woke in the morning in a spinning but zombie world, I would feel extremely nauseous when I was on my way to work, and just zoned out at work the whole day, thus drinking a lot of caffeine, thus causing my anxiety
2. Mirtazapine 25mg, worked my like magic in the first week, felt completely like a different person, and I thought to myself, “wow is this what being a normal human being felt like?”, was on this meds for some time, anxiety disappeared one day, and then poof everything came back like a huge speeding train

Zopiclone – for mainly sleep, didn’t help much TBH. I took it rarely

3)	This is what I am currently taking, been 4 days Pristiq 25Mg, will be taking 50mg in a couple of day as instructed by my doc Concerta 26Mg – will be taking 37 mg in a couple of days as instructed by my doc So far it has been good, but worried about upping my dosage, after reading horror stories from other on reddit mainly about Pristiq

Let me explain my symptoms,

**Depression**: 

I think after over the years, I have become accustomed to the feeling i.e. used to it. It is not gone, but neither it is screaming at my face as it used to, it is just hovering, occasionally, it will tap my shoulders to remind me it Is there. Like a “hey you still remember me, I am still here you know” kinda way

**Anxiety:**

My anxiety is not there all the time, it is like a burglar who constantly just robs you. And when it hits, it hits hard. I have noticed that especially in recent years, it usually goes like this Everything in my life will be normal. Perfectly normal. And then in my mind, I will start thinking of certain situations, and the worst possible outcome of it.

Like for an example,(this didn’t happen, but I am narrating so that you can get a better understanding):

Lets say I got into a fight with a dude when I was a teen, and I hit his nose and it bled. I will randomly get reminded of it. There would be no obvious trigger. But somehow I will get reminded of it, I will think about it, without even me realizing. And then BOOM, my anxiety will be back in, and I will be obsessed about it, like I would start to think what if he is out to get me, what if he bring me to court and try to sue me, then I will start going down this rabbit hole of asking people can someone sue me for something tha t I did to them in the past when I was teen, start thinking how my life will be ruined. I will be obsessed with it for a few days.. and I will get extremely exhausted mentally and physically. And the poof as randomly as it came, it will randomly disappear.

**ADHD**: 

I have the obvious symptoms of ADHD as most people with ADHD. But these are what stands out, My brain fog is constant, and it has gotten worse as I grow older ( I am 30 now) I feel as if I am in my 90s My dyslexia is bad, and getting very bad, like sometimes I can even spell simple words, and I cant comprehend numbers as well. My eyes randomly lose focus on things. As usual, I can’t concentrate, but when I try to concentrate, instead of just getting distracted, I get nauseous.

I have cut down sugar, I only drink water. Maybe once a month, I drink a can of soft drink Absolutely 0 caffeine, not even coke, not even tea. And I used to be daily coffee drinker since I was in my teens, I would easily go 3 cups in a day.

I have significantly cut down on alcohol and I only drink beers and no strong beers. I don’t go more than 2 -3 beers a time.

Just like my coffee, I used to be a heavy drinker thanks to my ADHD, I would easily drink a whole bottle of jack denial’s by myself in one seating (2-3hrs) with only water as my mixture, and not be drunk or even high.

I have started exercising, meditating. Practicing all the things in book. But I am still stuck. Does anyone experience this?

I can relate to those feelings to some extent. My advice? Realize that being overly intense and eager can be off-putting, try to make plenty of friends so no one relationship is critical to you.

"Sometimes people are busy with their lives, especially if they're working adults who have families. It's very hard to make, keep, and maintain relationships as an adult. It's honestly why most of us are alone these days and live on the internet. 

I think the biggest thing to learn is their behavior is often not intentional, and has nothing to do with you. You can try your best to be likeable, but sometimes you're just not meant to be close to that person. Maybe there's another person better suited to be a friend or partner or who has time/interest that the person you're currently focused on doesn't have. 

It's good you're able to be self aware and realize you've been projecting. As someone who has projected/been projected on to, both are quite crappy to experience. It's good to be enthusiastic and excited to talk to people, maybe you need to find people who have the same energy as you, who are just as excited to talk and hang out. 

It could also be that they're introverted or low energy. If you're the opposite, it can be challenging to arrange a chat or hangout.

"All of us get to a point in our lives where we say “is this it? Is this all my life is going to be?” You had dreams and aspirations and not all of them are going to come true. We can look at our own lives and it might seem mundane or underwhelming, or look at other people's lives, even people quite close to us and see that they seem to have everything we want. Its a really easy trap to fall into in the age of social media, seeing people’s lives literally through a filter that makes it seem better than it is.

Its easy to cling tightly to our dreams - we get told all the time to follow your dreams, don’t give up on your dreams. Its good to have aspirations but if our happiness is attached to them then we suffer when everything doesn’t pan out as we would like. Its a cliche but it’s really important to try to enjoy the journey of life rather than focusing on the destination. Whats the point of grinding towards something off in the future if we can’t be happy in the present?

And here's the thing: no one's life is perfect. It might not seem like it but everyone is suffering. Everyone has their struggles and challenges, no matter how picture-perfect their Instagram feed might be. The key to enjoying our lives is to cultivate gratitude for what we have, rather than focusing on what we don't have.

When we practice being aware and present in our own life, our own mundane existence, we can start to notice the small things in life that we might otherwise overlook. Taking a moment to appreciate the warmth of the sun on your skin, or the taste of a delicious plate of irish stew. A bird landing on the fence. Sharing a joke with a work colleague. A child laughing because you're so incredibly funny.

These small moments of pleasure might seem everyday, ordinary, but that's where life is hiding. Its hiding in plain sight in the wonderful, miracle of our existence. When we feel gratitude for our little joys, we’re walking the path of happiness.

The key thing to remember is that joy isn’t like the good silverware, something that we only bring out when there’s a special occasion. We can apply it to the little things in our small little boring lives - in doing so they become miraculous.

I can remember that it was a summer afternoon in 1988. I was at my first residential treatment facility, and I was upset about not being able to be with my family. We were all standing in line like good little children, when I noticed another kid wearing a shirt my grandfather bought me. I was so angry, I had never felt like that before. I imagine I thought, why am I so angry I take the meds they give, so why is a shirt making me so mad? Anyway, I ended up decking the kid and taking my shirt. Next thing I know, I am being slammed on the floor, and a needle is going into my backside. A few hours later, I woke up locked in a seclusion room naked and terrified, not knowing what happened. At that very moment, I knew my life was never going to be the same, and it hasn't. At 7 years old, I learned that there were drugs that could make time disappear. Drugs like amitryptiline, thorazine, mellirill even intramuscular benadryl. No child should ever be injected with these drugs. 

The stuff I remember from my childhood are mostly happy memories, but I couldn't tell you when they happened, where they happened, or who I was with. What I can tell you is that the psychotropic medicine that was used on me as a child has permanently destroyed my memories. 

So, as a result of my outburst, they put me on a wonderful drug we all know and love Ritalin. You must have ADD/ADHD. We're not sure, but let's try this and see how it works. Well, I'll tell you how it worked for me, I got violent, and I mean the kind of violence that is usually in movies. I ended up in seclusion and injected so much that it's a blur. How do I know that I was violent? Well, without ever stepping foot in a courtroom, I somehow ended up with 32 counts of 4th degree assault on my record by the time I was 12. In those 5 years, I was placed in five different facilities, all with different methods of treating troubled children. 

In one of those facilities, I was raped by my roommate. I was 9, and he was 14. After this event, I tried to kill myself twice. Both failed hangings. Wouldn't you know that 2 years later, I was placed in another facility with him. I was even forced into doing victim/abuser therapy with him. By 11 years old, I  had been raped, drugged, and unsuccessfully tried suicide twice."	BloodBruin	post	31.19641422229844	male	White	0.9425673484802246	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth
"I am so sorry ❤️‍🩹

This one is definitely above Reddit’s pay grade, but I’ll take a stab at it, since I’m here. 

I’ve got a long fucked to story too, but a few things I’ve learned so far; 

You can’t hold it in, or push away what happened, or intellectualize it, you’ve got to fucking cry your heart out.

 You’ve got to go through the stages of grief; including and especially anger, when I finally allowed my anger out it’s almost burnt me to a crisp; it was biblical levels of rage. It hurts like a motherfucker but you’ve got to let it out. 

You’re going to feel dead and depressed and deflated when you’re done and it could last weeks or months of getting it out. 

But it’s like pulling out the knife and burning out the infection; it’s gonna feel worse before it gets better. 

Then you’ve got to weep and take care of yourself like a sick baby. Sleep, and soup, and hot baths and fuck the world for a while. Watch some cartoons you loved as a kid. 

It’s not your fault. It is not your fucking fault. You deserved so much better. And it’s not fair. And the people who put you through all this deserve anything bad that happens to them. 

It’s okay to be pathetic for a while; and be selfish and just do the bare minimum for while, you don’t have to fix everything all at once. 

Learn to ask for help. There’s a lot of fucked up cruel sadistic people out there as you very well know, but there’s also so many of us want to help. 

Start small; watch a campfire, or stargaze, or get a fish (human eyes/brains love watching fish). 

Get a dog if you have the energy to take care of them. Or a cat. Humans are really good at disregarding ourselves but will literally live longer if we have someone who depends on us. (They did studies of cognition and life expectancy in old age homes and found amazing results ) 

Get back into your body; find something rhythmic like swimming, yoga, Jiujitsu, rock climbing etc. that gets you out of your head and into your body. 

“The Body Keeps The Score” by Bessel Van Der Kolk is a dense read but very helpful and informative. 

And lastly, don’t try to do all this all at once; pick one small thing first, don’t burn out trying to heal, it’s also good to just say fuck it sometimes; just don’t live there. 

If you’re going through hell; keep going. ♥️"	BloodBruin	reply	na	na	na	0.9425673484802246	strong	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"I'm at a loss as to what to do.

The hunger is too much again.

I've been waiting since September for disability, here I am, my first payment finally due Monday after such a fight and yet I want to drag a blade up my wrist and end it all tonight. Hell, I most likely will. 

I just can't cope anymore, I need support.

The pain from this biting hunger is too much, the food banks won't help as I've ""had too many parcels in the last few months"" claiming it's to prevent abuse. I have no power, no gas, no internet so I'm sat her bored and hungry in the cold. My phone's data all I have to keep me distracted. That too will be turned off at midnight in 5hrs time as I can't pay the bill and then I'll be truly alone.

"My dreams if I ever have any are still nightmares, I’ll wake up feeling like a ball of anxiety. The dreams and thoughts of self harm/ending it all never get better. 
I have cried myself to sleep off and on for  around 15 years… the self harm as in cutting stopped years ago due to me being tired of people talking about it. Getting told it’ll all be fine soon. Just keep trucking on. All those people left my life. Multiple stating I’m to depressing to be around/talk to. Idk I guess it just seems like no matter what I have tried or thought about trying doesn’t work at all. Idk what causes me to be such an upset mess. Childhood/teenage trauma or just my brain being wired wrong. I’m tired of living and basically everything in my life. 
The only reason I’m still alive is due to not wanting to hurt my family.. mainly my parents who spent my entire life just trying to give me the best life they could afford/give me. The thoughts then get worse thinking about how all the people who left my life due to me being a sad/downer. Anytime anything goes good something comes and crashes to make everything just feel hopeless and helpless. I’m definitely a person who has a lot of mental health issues. Being autistic doesn’t help at all…. if anything I feel it makes everything worse. The suicidal thoughts and dreams never get better, I don’t feel comfortable talking to anyone about it since no body truly cares enough to listen. They’ll always just tell me to “think better thoughts”, “change my scenery” , “do more things out and about instead of being home alone most days” yet even if I try to change things everything falls back to how it was. 
I’m 26 years old. I never expected to live past 21. I couldn’t see a future or could never come up with a plan that made me think I’d have a long life. I know I’ll end up taking myself out. The only thing idk is when I’ll do it. Sisters who truly don’t give a fuck about me. Yet I always just wanted to spend time with them. Parents busy with work. Led me to isolate myself all day everyday when I was 8-15.. 
due to as said above I never felt confident or comfortable with anyone to talk about my SA/grooming I experienced as a child/pre teen. Which hyper sexualized me. Still besides talking 2 1 close friend who was always sexually assaulted.. which means I basically admitted it ti him. But never got into details about who or how many people it was. Having to see 1 of my groomers multiple times a year and sharing a bedroom with him/them when I was 15-18 anytime my parents let them stay the night.
I truly want to be happy, not just content in sadness. Idk why I can’t just find my happiness yet. It seems and feels like I’m meant to feel this shitty my entire life.


It seems like the only things I haven’t tried yet is taking myself out.
Maybe I just don’t belong here, maybe I never have. I feel like such a burden on everyone I ever cared about. Not smart, failing at almost everything I try. The more I try to be happy the more problems seem to come my way. Idk .. who knows maybe I should just give up and give in. I don’t believe many will even notice. I just seriously and honestly have nothing left to try and I doubt it’ll make a difference. I been having these thoughts and dreams since a teen.. if anything they just been getting worse as the years go on.

"There is actually a paradox that the harder you ""try"" at being happy the harder it is to become happy. If your always ""trying"" to open the door you'll never actually open the door because that requires you to stop trying and actually do open the door. (Btw there's nothing that says you even have to imagine that door in your head being closed, or even you having to open it, it can be an automatic door that open instantly for you whenever you want it to. This is the beauty of the mind, at its best and worst it's only ever a suggestion to YOU who is listening to the ""brain"". Which, btw, is a thought factory and not everything that is made at the factory is good for use, right? ) Instead work on doing things that make you happy and allow happiness to be a byproduct of what youre doing. This is what most people mean when they say  "" think better thoughts"" or ""change the scenery"". What there saying is quit focusing so hard on being happy and focus on stuff that makes you happy. They are just trying to relay that idea but through their own filters. 
  Also, I think happiness is super great and everything but it's not the end all be all of the emotions. Curiosity, Equanimity, passion, wonderment, resilience, and enjoyment plus others are also equally valid emotions to switch out with happiness imo and in some cases even cause happiness.

"I've been quite suicidal lately. 

Well very.

I've been struggling, fighting the British government for the disability payments I'm entitled too since September, each time it got delayed and delayed when I was close.

Yesterday it went to a tribunal, and I was there for a while, a good few hours.

Presenting my case, my arguments, they made theirs and then. Finally after 6 whole months. I got the award.

Monday I get all my missed back pay, court ordered. Then every 9th of the month I get what I'm entitled too, with another PIP payment every 4 weeks exactly from the 14th. 

For the first time in a very long time I'm stable. 

Sure I'll struggle till Monday, I won't be able to eat till then most likely, but after that there's finally a light at the end of all this.

I'll be able to pay to have my power and gas supply restored with the back pay, go and buy some food, eat a warm meal for the first time in a very long time.

I'm finally free, because I held on even when I got close to the edge and the support of many here.

"Hi!

So I’m not sure if this is the right sub to post this in but I’d like to learn to dress better or in a way that would make me feel better about myself. 

For some context I grew up in a neglectful environment. My parents had money and my mother would buy me expensive clothes, that she chose for me to wear. I wasn’t encouraged to explore my likes or dislikes or express myself. I’ve also been training at an elite level in sports all my life so most of the time I’d just wear sweatpants and a squad T-shirt/hoodie. I never really considered matching different types of clothes to create a “fit” and I never minded until now. 

Today I wear the same two pair of worn shoes. Same rotation of 5-7 T-shirt’s and sweatpants.
I’m in my late 20s starting University again and I’m just embarrassed by what I wear to my classes. The idea of shopping for myself is overwhelming but I want to change this. So I was wondering if anyone has some tips on where to start?"	BeemosKnees	post	13.699160401062993	female	White	0.9966421127319336	na	na	na	2	malementalhealth
"As someone who was never taught to dress and later leaned in to a personal style I can tell you that wearing a good outfit does incredible things for your confidence.

People compliment you more, people make more positive assumptions about you, you attract people who put similar amounts of effort into their own appearance.

A good style is life changing IMO.

I strongly recommend this YouTube channel. It has tons of good advice (but the video titles don't really help) https://youtu.be/1W7Osk5C5PI

Lastly, they say you don't need a lot of money to have a nice outfit... Unfortunately, that is largely a lie. If you want clothes with quality construction, durable materials, and stylish cuts, you're going to have to drop some money on good pieces. The number one thing you should do is invest in a high-quality pair of casual brown or black leather boots. https://youtu.be/9kuHyyefNGE

Looking to improve my English speaking skills to start online therapy, and I'd like to talk with anyone who needs me! (For free of course, this is  NOT an advertisement, and I won't make you pay later!)

About me being able to help you:

\- People naturally talk about their life to me IRL and share thoughts, for me it's natural to ask them the right questions and reflect on their fals beliefs and give a reality-check how they can change and how their perception is distorted negatively. I have a natural talent for psychology.

\- I am very respectful, attentive, kind person who would honestly want to help.

\- I'm in a state where I see Oneness and truth values of life which I follow.

\- I have very serious mental illnesses which I completely healed naturally by myself and now I live in peace even in hard circumstances, I'm in control of my reality.

\- You'll be feeling free and accepted - I have raised many people's self-esteem and changed their world view radically, but this only works with people who are open.

\- Relationship, communication (self-expression and understand others), career, mental illnesses, just any advice needed to understand your thoughts even if it's a small problem...

"Seems you haven't met your aggressive/vindictive side yet.

It's not just you man, we all have it, although not everyone is aware.  
Mine for example almost lead to me killing my own sister, I was always the meek kid who shrunk away when picked on, so people took me as an easy target.  
Well that shit was gathering up in a nasty ball of resentment, one day my sister went too far hitting me and things turned in a flash. The meek boy shrunk away completely and then the aggressive side was all that is left, even tho I always felt small physically I was 2x the size of my sister and 3x her strength, when that all pours into aggression people get hurt.  
Luckily I also have a side that recognizes hurt, so I snapped out of it when I saw the pain I was causing.

So if your aggression never gets a chance to play it's sort of like a dog that has been locked in the basement all these years, you can expect it to be ever more unsettled.  
I would consider it the side of you that wants to get some play time, even if it frightens you it's best to take it out for a walk before it busts the door down in a critical moment and really hurts someone.

If you’re still bothered by them, therapy or meditation can be affective. But what helps me the most is vocally acknowledging the thoughts as though they were someone else.

"Hi. Around 3, maybe 4 years ago now (I was either 15 or 16), my friend showed me the horror film ‘Gerald’s Game’. I’ve always been someone who’s terrible with horror and my overactive imagination would prevent me from watching the tamest scary things without struggling to sleep at night. I was told the film wasn’t much scarier than ‘Get Out’ which I loved, but upon watching it I found they were severely wrong. It played into a lot of what I’m scared of, and still 3,4 years later, it keeps me up at night. I’d say around 90% of the nights since watching that film I’ve had to try and calm myself down from being too creeped out to go to sleep or walk around the house with the lights off. It genuinely terrifies me and I can joke about it but when I’m alone it does affect my sleep, not to the highest degree, but going to bed frightened, checking under my bed at the age of 19 and struggling to calm myself to sleep is getting really boring now. I was wondering if it’s possible this is a sign of trauma or something, because this is more than just been creeped out if it’s been this long. I’d really appreciate help for this.
Thanks a lot. I wasn’t sure where to post so I hope this is ok."	TopNew1798	post	30.048818516658066	female	White	0.01985994353890419	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth
"I think that's valid and/or possibly that it touched on something you experienced before (maybe prolonged exposure to an emotionally volatile home that felt unsafe).

I remember being triggered by seeing American Beauty because some of the abusive dynamics and dysfunction was so similar to what was happening with my family.

Maybe it connected with other experiences and amplified your anxieties too plus not being able to really process it all with others or for yourself can add to the dynamic.

Trauma tends to happen when someone is so overwhelmed that the experience skips conscious processing and gets dumped into deep memory (kind of like archiving an important email before even getting to read it while the sender still wants to know or hear from you).

So even if someone was already tired and they see something shocking or disturbing, then sleep on a way that encodes the memory but never really got to work through making sense of everything happening there's a possibility that it could have been trauma. And while the dsm5 might have changed, the difference between acute stress vs traumatic stress disorders used to be just about how long someone was living with persisting symptoms. And they don't account for complex PTSD that can come from developmental adversity/neglect/trauma either which can happen in far less overt ways like lack of emotional support/child neglect or starvation and chronic hunger or housing insecurity.

You might get good perspective from asking or crossposting at r/PTSD r/cptsd and maybe r/cptsdfreeze r/cptsdfightmode (plus r/cptsdnextsteps to see how folks who are in later stages of processing sharing solutions).

I hope that helps get you started in finding what can help you with your path on healing, wishing you the best."	TopNew1798	reply	na	na	na	0.01985994353890419	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"I am not implying that I got 100% okay from just 1 pill. That would be stupid. But I still want to share my story in case someone else benefits from it.

One day in January 2020, I woke up with a severe back pain. I didn’t think too much about it and thought I probably pulled a muscle at the gym. The pain got worse and worse overtime and started interfering with sleep. I was getting 3 hours of sleep due to the excruciating pain. So decided to go to the doctor.

He ordered several bloods tests and the results shook him and me. He told me he suspects blood cancer. That news put me in severe depression. As a 24 year old, I lost all the motivation I had for my dreams and aspirations overnight. My girlfriend at the time left me because my mental health led to me spending less time with her. So she called it quits. So not only was I depressed about my health, I also was heartbroken from the breakup. I was all alone during lockdown and decided not to give the bad news to my family just to avoid them from worrying about me. I didn’t tell them about the breakup either. I thought let me first confirm if the diagnosis is accurate, and then I’ll come clean.

Over 4 months, the results came back normal and the possibility of blood cancer was dismissed. However by now, I developed chronic sleep problems. I could never sleep for longer than 3 hours. I spent my day with extreme headache, foggy brain and occasional fever. My cognitive levels went down to that of a 5 year old and my work at grad school was getting compromised. 

I decided to extend my graduation since I couldn’t handle it anymore. For the next 2 years, I tried several antidepressants, gabapentin, Hydroxyzine and nothing worked. By this time, my memory was nothing but mush, my motivation had died, and I could see all my friends getting jobs, getting married and having children. At the same time, I lost my own self respect because I am single again, lost my scholarship and am once again dependent on my dad financially at 26. 

Even though my father has never stopped supporting me, I can sense the worry he has for me. I hate making him feel this way. Deep down I know it’s really bothering him and given that he already has hypertension I really want to take the load away from him. I’m so glad my mother is there to take care of him. 

Anyway, I was finally prescribed clonazepam yesterday. I took 1 mg and oh god what can I say. I feel like a baby again. No more headaches or anxiety. My brain fog is still there but hopefully the exercises and meditation will solve that completely.

I am aware of all the risks benzos possess. However, I only wish some doctors weren’t this strict about it for the fear of destroying a person’s life. Well guess what, not prescribing sooner destroyed 3 years of my life. I hope more people understand the benefits of benzos and not suspect every patient to be someone who’s only  seeking drugs to abuse them.

Anyway, I only hope the worst is behind me and I can now focus on making up for my lost time. I don’t expect my problems to go away overnight but I can now at the very least see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I wanted to share this for the slight possibility of someone benefitting from my experience. Take care everyone."	Location-Such	post	28.320375100983135	male	White	0.03267407417297363	na	na	na	4	malementalhealth
"Alternative to some other comments: use the meds temporarily to get a handle on your life day to day. Depression, for me, is a spiral. And meds can help break the spiral and return control to me.

So this 14 year old kid is going through a heck of a lot. His parents went to Singapore and he became a citizen there. So sadly by NS laws he has to join the military no matter what he does. Not only that but his parents support it (they’re the bad guys of the story) they say that it will help him learn how to deal with hard times. They genuinely believe because according to him his mom gets depressed whenever he has a breakdown. She’s forcing him to learn piano and karate but he enjoys piano so u can scratch that. and is always nagging the boy about school which always gets him in a bad mood. He’s going through a lot and vents on the daily. Which has been draining me. We have 2 other ppl who try to help him though for well over a week now we have made no progress because he refuses to take any advise. We did everything that we could think to do with no progress. We even tried getting him to get an actual therapist which we tried today. He then acted like he was going to actually commit suicide (he says that a lot sadly which we have been trying to fix) but then after I almost fell back into depression he admitted that he only said that because he wanted to make us feel pain. Which shocked me. I questioned everything. How many times could he have done that? Is his depression real? Is this just some sick joke? I thought about it and confirmed that his depression is real. But these days it’s getting too much for me to handle. Not to mention I have a tutor now while homeschooled. I’m not an actual therapist. I’m a 16yo who wants to be one and I know damn well I’m not qualified to do this. Neither is anyone else. He also has a plan to commit suicide by the age of 18 because that’s when he’s going back to Singapore to be forced onto the military.		post	3.2892605055170137	female	White	0.9986874461174011	na	na	na	4	malementalhealth

Honestly seems like his parents are just trying to get him to live life and be stronger mentally, why is that such a bad thing? Obviously I don’t know the whole story or hell even most of it but from what’s given the parents seem to care a lot and want to help him feel better and if the mother gets depressed when her son is hurting then clearly they care. But to answer your question, others decisions should not take priority over your own health and well being, if he truly decided to hurt himself after the situation is not on you and you need to prioritize making healthy decisions for yourself but from the sounds of it him as well. This doesn’t seem like it’s a very healthy dynamic and could cause more damage than good long term unfortunately.		reply	na	na	na	0.9986874461174011	no	no	strong	na	malementalhealth
"Progressist media usually pushes women's struggles as a priority using a false need for austerity to justify it, as if there weren't enough resources to include men in the budget or, worse yet, as if about half the population suffering can wait because productivity is going fine in spite of that.

Then we've got the absurd denial of circumcision being this barbaric procedure intended to hinder men's pleasure, further enforced by a refusal to address the prostate in favor of calling women's sex experiences 'mystical' to close the orgasm gap. No wonder orgasm envy based on media hearsay is a widespread problem among men (look up 'female orgasm envy reddit').

And when such factors result in a marginalized minority of guys with poor mental health, they get shamed as incels, told to just live with their problems as privilege 'tradeoffs'.

This... I don't want to live in a world like this. I want to know that there are women out there who actually desire and crave men feeling good and being happy as much as the other way around is peddled in songs, movies, and books.

"I don't believe that feminism or progressive movements are the primary obstacles to improving mental health among men. Engaging in gender wars is unproductive and nonsensical. However, it's clear that neither feminism nor the discourse around gender equality recognizes the unique challenges that men face. The focus is largely on women's issues, with the assumption that solving those issues will also benefit men.

Men's mental health discourse, recognition, and concrete legislation attempts to remedy are where the women's equality movement was in the 1950s. As a result, men who are struggling with mental health issues are left with few resources and little hope for solutions."

"I agree with your points, although your post does come across as blaming women and feminism for these issues which I think misses the mark.

Surely religion and conservatism are to blame for circumcision (in the countries that do that) and homophobia (when it comes to ignoring/shaming the prostate)? And surely the lack of focus on men's mental health is a result of mental health not being treated seriously across the board, combined with patriarchal ideas that men need to be strong and manly and NEVER have emotions? Some people call this toxic masculinity, but you could also consider it an outdated gender norm. 

All the things you've listed are issues that feminists (generally, women) care about dismantling. I just worry you're making an enemy out of an ally here, and the real thing we should be rallying against is conservatism/outdated gender norms that negatively impact both men and women."

"edit: I think a  number of OP's ideas and beliefs are a distortion and are not helpful to live by. I would say this about anyone making the same kinds of assumptions. I do think that his frustration is legitimate regardless, and I do think that men deserve to have their problems taken seriously, just like any other person. that includes wanting men to have a healthy connection to their identities and sexuality, and believing they deserve to feel like their sexuality is something sweet and sacred, just as more women are doing with female sexuality.

dude I'm sorry but circumcision (unlike female genital mutilation) is not ""intended to hinder men's pleasure,"" where on earth did you get this idea? there is other rationale behind it, although yes I agree that it is a form of genital mutilation, and if I have a male child I don't want to have this done

I'd also like you to remember that in the past it wasn't even acceptable to talk about women's orgasm. it's elevated and brought up so much because it has been and still is for many women something that is treated as less important in their sexual interactions, or something they feel more shameful about exploring and understanding. not long ago many women didn't even realize they had a clitoris because anything related to female anatomy was so shameful, and many women feel like they don't know how or have to fake orgasm so as to make sure their male partner doesn't feel insecure or some shit. not that male anatomy hasn't been treated with shame too, but at least it was considered normal and expected for men to like .. come during sex.

there's all sorts of really weird stuff about this. often when things are suppressed to this degree, yes you will see the pendulum swing the other way and see more things that celebrate what was suppressed (kind of like how gay people were ostracized forever and now you have gay pride parades lol .. something that people who feel threatened by lgbt people also complain about). of course you're going to see women treating their sexuality as something beautiful and magical, they're reclaiming something that throughout so much of history has literally been treated as inherently impure, evil and morally wrong. (again, men's sexuality has not been that much better, but it has at least been treated as ""eh men are men, they're sexual, it's to be expected,"" it's a given. but a woman being horny? obviously she's in the grip oF THE DEVILLLLLL THAT WHOOOOORE)

and I mean, is it men who started this 'mystical orgasm' narrative? because it's my bet that it's moreso been women -- as I said -- reclaiming it. men need to reclaim theirs too. sexuality not as something predatory, but as something beautiful, an act of creation. because it certainly can be! (I mean it can be both unfortunately, but that is 100% true of women's sexuality as well -- something that also needs to be understood more. women can be predators too.)

that all being said, yes I agree men's mental health and happiness matters and needs attention. they're humans like everyone else. I am a woman and I crave men feeling good and happy and like they're worth something, just like every living being has worth endowed upon them by the fact that they have a conscious experience"	GreedyCounty6149	reply	na	na	na	0.9979552030563354	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

As a girl I agree with this post but I don’t think progressist media is the issue. Of course I might be wrong and I’d be glad to hear your opinion on why but I think it’s general society and it has been like that for a long time. Since the ideas of men having to be ‘strong’ and ‘brave’ are in place and heavily supported by people a lot of men end up feeling like they aren’t allowed to cry or have any of what we’ve decided to label as ‘femenine’ feelings. It develops an idea of having any sort of fragile emotion of happy emotion as a female emotion which is completely wrong. However woman also have expectations and stereotypes put on them to be ‘submissive’ and ‘fragile’. The difference is is that like most other prejudice events we experience which lead up to larger scales of discrimination, we get so focused on not offending those communities we ignore the fact that other groups can experience disadvantage because of gender etc	GreedyCounty6149	reply	na	na	na	0.9979552030563354	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
Since coming back after Christmas, my lab partner at university has been increasingly rude towards me. She has always had selfish tendencies, a very skewed belief in equality and been short during conversations but recently she has been legitimately horrible. I calmly told her that she is being rude and it isn’t fair for her to treat people the way she is doing and now I am a social pariah at uni, with many of my course mates telling me that I was rude to tell her and I am immature for disagreeing with them. Am I going completely mad? I now want to leave this course as I have no support from anyone here, I haven’t been able to sleep or eat or look after myself properly and I don’t feel enjoyment from doing anything and no one seems to care.

The equality thing doesn’t matter too much to me, just frustrating hearing how she just rinses men for money… the disagreement happened when she claimed I had done nothing to help her with a piece of work that I had spent a lot of time assisting her with, even behind after uni to support her so I just told her that isn’t true and she started shouting at me and telling me I’m a lier and embarrassing her on purpose. She has since talked to people and lied about me to make them think I am a bully and she is the victim (again something she has said before about lecturers when they have given her a low mark for something).

"I had a mental breakdown yesterday and I was close to taking all of my Seroquel, and just walk into a forest and fall asleep. My mother has MS and heart problems and is a smoker. My dad committed suicide and had a 16 hour standoff with police. This was after I was SA'd two years previous. I'm only 26 and I really don't want to bury my only parent and be parent less by 30 yrs old. My GF took me to my grandparents house and I just broke down and told them I was suicidal and I had a plan. My uncle (dad's brother), came over and talked me down from the ledge. 

I suffer from bipolar depression, anxiety, PTSD, and I kind of like auto pilot life. Days blend in with each other and I can't remember something I just read 5 minutes ago. When I try to do school I zone off into space thinking about nothing and when I snap out of it, I get frustrated. I used methamphetamine from 14 years old to 22. I stole from my family, and I did bad things in those years. I went to rehab just 2 years ago for 3 months, and then moved in with my now GF. She really helps me and is very caring and does so much for me even though she has muscular dystrophy and other problems as well. 

I have the desire to better myself, I often daydream about hitting the books hard, or exercising, or reading a good book. But I don't. I just come from work, I'm a line cook, I'm hot and tired and I just want to play games, so I do until I go to bed. As Ian Curtis of Joy Division sang, ""I got the spirit, but lose the feeling."" And that's exactly how I feel. I imagine myself doing things to better myself, yet I just choose entertainment that doesn't really benefit me in any way, but just used as escapism. I don't want to self diagnose myself, but I feel like I have low testosterone levels, and I just kind of sink myself into the muck and mud of my mind as I ruminate on things because I'm also an alcoholic as well, and I just overthink everything, and I see the bullshit in everyday life. Nuclear warfare, doom, and such runs through my mind as I see the news show me the latest in the corruption of mankind. I really want to focus on the positives and try to rewire my brain into not being so negative and forcing me to relive memories that I honestly don't want to envision. I want to read more, I want to learn more, I want to be able to actually push myself instead of giving up before things even happen. I just want and wish to be a better me."

Have you ever considered that you might suffer from [CPTSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder)? r/CPTSD has a wiki and lots of newcomer resources at their page. With your SA, your severe emotional neglect, genetic dispositions and a lot more, it's possible you find yourself or parts of yourself in some entries at r/CPTSD. Generally you seem to know very well how things work - at least you give sound advice to others! As you had to endure unimaginable amounts of negative things, probably some lack of energy and the ever interrupting/disturbing/interfering ricochets of the past make things hardly endurable.

"Earlier today before I left work, I was working with customers at the jewelry counter when I had a pair of teenage girls very obviously giggling and laughing at me behind my back and even taking fucking pictures of me behind my back. Then when I noticed they sarcastically say “have a nice day” and leave the store. Those little piss goblins legitimately upset me and pissed me off and made me realize how much of a goddamn loser I was. I felt like I was making some mental progress with being able to control my intrusive thoughts and talk with others, but now I second guess myself. Am I such an inherently contemptible sludge bag so unworthy of respect or basic human decency that I have to experience that? It makes me wanna go up in my bed and sleep in the rest of the day

the point being, those teenagers are like that little kid. they're kids. their opinions about you are not really a valid bar by which to judge yourself. and this,

"" I know that every single one of them is far far far superior to me in every way"",

is a huge assumption with so many variables that you don't actually have any information about whatsoever. I understand why you'd feel that way but try to be aware about when you're creating stories based on your beliefs rather than real information that you have about the situation. our minds love to trick us into telling stories and then believing them.

btw how are you certain they were laughing at YOU and taking pictures?

also as u/loools pointed out, if you're working at a jewelry store you did SOMETHING right to make yourself seem fairly reliable/customer relations-capable lol. this interaction with little kids who, depending on their position in life, sometimes have nothing better to do than look down on others (and adults do this too of course) ... it does not say anything about the other interactions you've had recently that have led you to feel a little more confident and able to deal with intrusive thoughts.

also try not to worry about ""controlling"" intrusive thoughts. I know that sounds weird, but try to just let them come and go rather than trying to like .. cage them up in a dungeon and telling yourself they're bad and need to be controlled. recognize them for what they are, ""ah, had a bad experience, having some difficult thoughts again now.

2-	Don't Take Anything Personally Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own dream.   
3-	Don't Make Assumptions Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.

M 20 here both diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. I felt pretty great half the day today, then I got hit with a random wave of tiredness, like HARD, I felt RLLY tired that I want to sleep. But I pushed through and felt ok, went out and did some errands with my brother and friend and it went well. I get back home and I feel so off, I feel so out of place, so out of touch with my surroundings and I just don’t feel right. I feel so blunt, yet I feel so nervous and ugh idk how to explain it. But I was searching up all kinds of things like do I have dissociation or do I have schizo or do I have this. And I just kept thinking and thinking, what if I go insane, what if I go crazy and I kept thinking stupid things that sound so unearthly like what if Im not actually here, what if im somewhere else. What if im still back at this place(the store I went earlier when running errands)? I just feel so disconnected and it’s driving me nuts, I’ve felt like this for an hour and it’s still going, im so nervous, im scared I just want it to all cease. I want the thinking to cease and feel normal again. I’ll never get better at this point. I literally have a job interview too tomorrow bro, like I’m never gonna be able to hold down a job in this condition…	sailorxcosmos	post	19.773105899704284	male	White	0.999262273311615	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth
"Unfortunately with depression and anxiety you have two major energy drains. Those disorders force you to invest lots of energy into spiraling dismal thoughts and ever threatening fears. Of course it's not your fault and also you can't change it in the near future, but your only chance to prevent more damage to your mind is to balance your energy. Like if you feel this hard tiredness, get some rest and avoid energy consuming things like doing things with other people. You need to learn to say no and postpone things to better times. After you did those errands, of course you felt better, because you've accomplished something. But at the same time you forced you energy reservoir to an exhaustive/total discharge. Total discharges take a lot more regeneration time than normal recharges (like from 10% to 20% takes two hours, but from 0% to 10% takes a whole day). 

Consider taking behavioral talk therapy in addition to your medication to learn those everyday skills/coping strategies. Those are your tools to accomplish all the tiny steps everybody recommends all the time to get better/battle your disorders. If getting talk therapy is no option atm, there are online resources for [CBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy#Methods_of_access)."	sailorxcosmos	reply	na	na	na	0.999262273311615	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"Hi! I'm a psychotherapist interested in participating in some discussion about people-pleasing/approval-seeking/codependent behavior in men.  


I've overcome a lot of this in myself and in my relationships. I'm interested in knowing about your experiences of it, either in yourself, or in men you know.   


Some ideas I'm landing on are:  


1. People-pleasing is an impulse most of us have to deal with.
2. People-pleasing tendencies can be reduced through reflecting ad managing one's emotions when they feel the impulse, instead of acting on it.
3. People-pleasing behavior can be manipulative: the goal is not to promote another's pleasure or happiness, but to earn their approval. 

Here's an article I recently wrote about it: [https://mg-counseling.com/approval-seeking-part-1-counseling-cedar-park/](https://mg-counseling.com/approval-seeking-part-1-counseling-cedar-park/)

" Hi there,

Basically, due to various layers of ""coping against nevroses I developed growing up"", I'm not that thoughtful... And I am generally ill-at-ease when others begin being thoughtful to me, too. I'd rather their not being thoughtful and not expect anything in return, but it doesn't work like that when I bond with someone new.

As a result, I'm off-mood whenever celebrations, events (a birth, a wedding), surprises or gifts are observed. Even in my professional life... I just never really feel proud of myself for anything, so work-goal-celebrations are not exciting either.

Otherwise I'm generally nice, I engage in conversations, I'm regarded as a kind person, I never intentionally hurt someone, no criminal record, no heavy cheating or lying, I am there to listen to friends if they come to me with bad news and need attention. On the gift side, I'd rather pay for someone's item if they ask me to, rather than to prepare a surprise, so I wouldn't say I'm not generous. Regarding birthday cards and other consumables, I just see them as something that takes space and eventually gets thrown to the bin, so I'll say my best wishes orally if the occasion comes.

That one bit of indifference to good moments puts me apart, certain people can grow resentful. My family on my father's side has been pissed off a lot about my behaviour when I was a teenager. And I was pissed off too because, after my parent's divorce, these \*hypocrites\* used to hate on my mother, to wish her ill. And expected me to treat them good because they treated \*me\* good. That's one of the roots of my nevrose. My mother has done a number of things that became nevroses too, so she wasn't a saint either.

I'm doing therapy. I am moving at a slow pace. I am not sure how to communicate to others that I still love them and to please respect how awkward I am around the fact I'm not as thoughtful as one could expect. My girlfriends asks me what I want for my birthday, I answer I want nothing. It is true, I have all what I want, is something is missing, I'll buy it. This pressure is terrible and it paradoxically makes me feel not worthy of anything.

I think the people around me could teach me how to improve, but if they teach me, and then I am thoughtful to them (who taught me), then ""it's not spontaneous anymore"", because they had to tell me, so, they won't be as pleased as if I had been thoughtful without their **prompt** in the first place... I am at loss, and obviously not very motivated for a change because of this reason.

Why do people need this thoughtfulness and the surprises to keep going in life? I don't. I'm the weird one. Sorry. If someone can offer judgement-free advice, I would appreciate it. Thanks,"	eyewave	post	31.264017644067184	female	White	0.995048463344574	na	na	na	4	malementalhealth
"For some people, receiving small gifts is the clearest way to express, ""You are someone I care about"".

I learned that these gifts can cost you exactly $0. 

I started writing letters to my friends on holidays. Just a fountain pen, paper, and a little spray of a nice fragrance. I sometimes slip in a sticker too. My friends send me messages back telling me how my letters brightened their whole day.

Buying gifts are nice, but taking a few minutes out of your day to craft something small by hand can show someone that you really do care about them. You're giving someone the physical manifestation of the time and effort you took out of your day to dedicate exclusively to them.

These small gifts are ways to express, ""Out of the 7 billion people on this planet, you are one of the few people who occupy space in my mind."""	eyewave	reply	na	na	na	0.995048463344574	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"I feel like I’m some ways we are similar.

I don’t feel like I need people to celebrate things like my birthday with attention and gifts. It seems silly and excessive. But I understand there are people in my life who really do value that. And while it may not matter to me, it matters to them. 

Why are you and I the “weird” ones vs them? I would argue we aren’t weird. That people are just different and that is totally ok.

There is a book about “love languages” that spells out the idea that people give and receive love in very different ways. For some people, it’s important to receive gifts. For other people, compliments, or spending time together, acts of service, etc. 

Conversely people demonstrate their love for others in different ways. 

It sounds like you know how people in your life prefer to receive love. Even if it’s different that what you prefer to give or receive. The fact that understand this and meet those people’s needs means you are both emotionally intelligent enough to understand those people and kind enough to give them what they needs.

It sounds like the people in your life don’t necessarily understand you as well as you understand them. And that’s ok! 

But you may have to teach them about you a little bit. Think about what matters to you. About what makes you feel good. Share those ideas with the people in your life but keep in mind that some of the other things they “give” you may be important thing for them to give. 

Long story short… if you can help people understand you a little better, you may see real improvement in your relationships."	eyewave	reply	na	na	na	0.995048463344574	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"Hey mate,

have you ever read about the 5 love languages? If you did and thought it was stupid feel free to ignore. If not, feel free to read on.

[https://5lovelanguages.com/](https://5lovelanguages.com/)

In short: They are the way that you like to show and also want to receive affection. While primarly intended for your spouse it works similar for all your loved ones and (platonic) friendships. Even casual or distant relationships like coworkers.  
The link I've posted above let's you take a simple test to figure out your love language(s). They're not mutually exclusive. While you may be leaning towards one more than the others you may also appreciate more than one.

You started your topic with ""I'm different"" and of course you are. Everyone is different. What you appreciate someone else does not.  
From what you've written receiving gifts is not one of your love languages. The same way you don't really want to receive gifts you also do not want to gift someone something. And that's totally okay.

Educating myself about love languages has helped myself tremendously, with my private love life but also with friendships.

"Ok, wow.  Frankly, I'm so grateful for your post man.  I relate to this so much.  I think I'm older than you and for better or worse, here's how I've chosen to view this.

Thoughtfulness is just a weakness of mine.  In the spirit of continual self improvement, I'm trying to be more attentive to people's like's and dislikes.  My wife and I have been through the 5 Love Languages--those recommendations are spot on.  Learning to spot people's Love Languages is almost like a cheat code.  And it's been so helpful to my marriage.  But as far as my own growth in this area is concerned, I have my peaks and valleys but I try not to overthink it and I also try to be graceful with myself.

Be more graceful to yourself than your father's side of the family is being with you.  Even though you're clearly trying to be nice about them in your post--for them to be guilting you that hard sounds dysfunctional to be frank.  It may even be a little entitled on their part as well.  Even still, try to be graceful with them and your mom's side too.  I think a key part of this is to not let deserve or not deserve enter the equation.  It's about being better at gift giving, kindness and empathy in general because that's what improving yourself in this case means.  Don't let their behaviors, one way or the other, get in the way of your being a better man.

\>now it's like the tension's snapped and a switch has flipped. i feel incredible. everything is going to be all right forever. i could do literally anything. i could become a renknowned philosopher or something even. i don't care if it's an asshole kind of thing to say, it's probably true and i've never felt this way before and god it's nice to finally have any amount of self-confidence and it's not like you work for them or have any power over me or anything. i could literally survive being hit by a car right now. i genuinely feel like i could and should try this, i am 100% vcertain this isn't going to go wrong. i'm not being ironic. i'm not telling a fucking joke. i'm immortal. i need to prove i'm immortal. i could literally walk out into the highway in front of my apartment, get hit by a semi, and survive. that's how fucking powerful i am right now. my hear t is beating so fast.

Do you journal or otherwise come to terms with your inner life in a non-judgmental way, as though a good friend or loved one was venting to you? Do you take special care to acknowledge even the tiniest things in life you're thankful for, even when everything is miserable and feels like it will never get better?

I want to be perfectly clear: none of these things will make you happy or magically transform your life. I'm not trying to sell you on fake positivity and I understand you probably have a hundred excuses why everything I just mentioned is meaningless. I've also been there and I struggle hard not to get to that point every day.

These are not strategies or tricks to make you a better person so you'll be more desirable or attractive. They're a few of the signs, side-effects, and consequences of someone who is trying to make themselves more tomorrow than they are today, a better self than they were yesterday, even if it's only by a tenth of a percent. 

I beg that if anything I mentioned is something you've not tried, that you at least give it some thought. As an absolute starting point: write a letter or journal complaining about everything you mentioned in this post and everything else you're frustrated about and hate about life. Write it by hand on paper, if possible. If the same thought keeps coming to you, just keep writing it over and over with all the frustration and fury that comes to mind.

Keep doing it. Fill multiple notebooks if you need to. Keep coming back to it every morning and night if you have more to complain about. Don't stop until you're so disgusted with the process that you feel like you can't write another sentence.

Again, it's not a magical cure for anything, but from personal experience I think you'll find it pretty relieving and you might end up writing down some complaints about life you never knew you were harboring.

"It's completely understandable to struggle with feelings of unworthiness, especially when it comes to intimacy. However, it's important to recognize that these beliefs can become self-fulfilling prophecies. In other words, if you continue to believe that you're unworthy of intimacy, you may unconsciously sabotage your chances of forming deep connections with others.

Instead of letting these negative beliefs hold you back, it's important to actively work on changing your story. This means challenging those negative thoughts and replacing them with more positive, empowering beliefs about yourself.

Most importantly, please know that you are absolutely worthy of intimacy and love. You are deserving of all the good things that life has to offer, and your struggles with self-worth do not diminish your inherent value as a human being. Take the time to care for yourself and prioritize your own well-being, and know that you are capable of forming deep, meaningful connections with others when you're ready."

"You'd be surprised by how many people seek it actually! Are you ready to give it to them too? A lot of people are super awkward about it. An obstacle is that they read many intentions into platonic affection.

An interesting way to go at it, that I've tried with success, is to just state it. That you're awkward, and have not had much if any of that intimacy but would love to try it, without any further intention. And always ask if they're okay with it! Hugging people out of nowhere can be bad if they're for example survivors of sexual assault, and it can be *anyone*, even that tall burly guy. There are many other reasons too, not always this dramatic.

Even for platonic intimacy the notions of consent, boundaries, and communication are very useful. That creates a reassuring frame too.

Another thing I've been doing is to represent touch, even if it's not actually doing it, through online interactions. If you put a lot of meaning behind it, you can work on your fears related to it in a safer and less overwhelming way.

You’re no burden bud and I know how it feels to go through what you are going through. I’m in the same boat but I don’t have the kids and wife and I’m sorry to hear about your son.  I don’t have any friends, no support from my family at all in fact they are making it worse and my father is the whole reason I’m going to an inpatient treatment center as he’s a severe narcissist and I’m the only one out of 3 in my family that can’t support myself and still needs help. I’ve been battling some sort of mental illness since i was 7 it never was addressed correctly. That being said I’ve been trying to figure out what is wrong with me for about 15 years and with my father’s emotional and mental abuse it’s just gotten to be waaaaay to much for me to get better without clinical help. I sit alone in my house for days on end and have developed agoraphobia which doesn’t help.  I know for a fact that if anything happened to me I wouldn’t be found for at least a week or more and the only reason is I wouldn’t be posting on Facebook. Hang in there and my suggestion if you don’t mind that I add it is research the clinical ketamine programs that have become available. My therapist says her daughter did it and she was finally feeling 100% better after like 4 treatments I believe. Drs and other’s are reporting an 85-90% success rate. It’s just a suggestion and ultimately you’re gonna do what works for you and you absolutely should because recovery from depression is extremely difficult and each individual’s needs are different. I wish you best of luck and keep your chin up and don’t be afraid to admit that you need help, it shows an incredible amount of strength even if your brain tells you negative things all day long. Yes, people may judge you but those are the wrong people to be around in that case.

Bingo. It sounds like you're doing a lot that is both healthy and working for you for the time being. Because progress doesn't come so fast, it often doesn't feel much like progress at all. I think feeling the way you do is completely normal, for what it's worth. I have days, sometimes weeks even, where I feel pretty similarly.

It might be good to like, force yourself to acknowledge what you do have going for you, and to express thankfulness.

PS: You might need to consult several endocrinologists, because doctors are people and thus come to different conclusions. Also, many are overworked and thus might not be inclined to give your case much thought, so ask for a copy of the lab results and do your own investigations, i.e. learn about the underlying issues."	dandy_dandy_dandy	reply	na	na	na	0.9985634684562683	strong	strong	strong	na	malementalhealth
 You are short, you can't change that, but you can make myself bigger by eating more and working out. Don't give up, people will see the work you've put in and be impressed. Just be consistent and don't give up.

Sorry to hear you're having a tough time bro but it does sound like you're trying to do what you need to do. Keep going to the gym. It is supposed to be hard. That is the point. Eat like crazy and put in the work every single day. Don't do it because of what other people may or may not think/say about you because that is in a mindset of indirectly letting other people control your actions. Do it for yourself my friend. If you do this, even when you don't want to, don't feel good, are tired, you can be proud of that. Your discipline will grow and make you powerful. If your body is your concern, and you have the ability already to go to the gym, you have all the tools you need to solve that problem. The only thing that can stop you from achieving is yourself. Master yourself.	dandy_dandy_dandy	reply	na	na	na	0.9985634684562683	strong	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"I feel you man. I dealt with the same shit, and still do to some extent now. In my freshman year of college I was 5’9” and about 115 lbs. I had always been skinny and then had a chronic stomach issue develop.

I now have it managed so now at 22 almost 23 I’m about 160 lbs. normal weight but I do still look skinny. I try to remember where I came from and how I’m doing better now than before. Even if I still have really bad body image I can at least say im improving.

"Keep going to the gym and eating more man, you'll get there. If you haven't already, go on r/gainit and read the FAQ to make sure you're working out in ways that will actually help you.   Your worth is absolutely not based on how you look, but you're right that it can ease your passage through life if you look athletic.  Everyone has to start somewhere, and there is absolutely nothing that says you can't make significant progress because you started out small.

Being short doesn't have to be the disadvantage you think it is.  It is *far* easier to get a muscular looking body when you're shorter because of how your body will be proportioned.  Tall lanky guys will have a much harder time looking big, so really there's pros and cons of both.   I'll also add in that you still have growing and filling out to do - I was one seriously skinny kid at 20, to the point where people asked me if I was ill. That isn't my body type at all at 28.

"I’m so sick of going online every day and seeing all men get lumped together in derogatory statements. I have horrendous self esteem and self worth issues, and have all of my life. So every time I see one of these comments or memes about how men are useless, how we’re scum, how we mistreat women, etc., it kicks me down even further. It makes me feel like if there are so many people who would hate on me just for my sex/gender then what’s the point of living? So I can have my already low self worth smashed even flatter? And I can’t even speak up about stuff like this outside of places like this subreddit. The moment i do I’m met with “there is no misandry” and accusations of being an incel, as though voicing concern at having my psyche whipped everyday could somehow make me think women owe me sex or mistreat them. No. I just makes me think a lot of people out there hates me until they get to know me. It’s shit like this that makes me immense grateful (not proud) that I’m a straight, white, cismale, because I’d have offed myself a long time ago from the increased hate from others for being anything else.

Edit: It seems I need to clarify some stuff. I understand why people say these things. My ex wife was assaulted once as a child, my mother was multiple times, and so were my cousins. I understand some people’s reasoning behind distrust of men in general. I also don’t feel like they are addressing me personally when people say these things. My issue is that it makes me feel subhuman that it is socially acceptable to make derogatory blanket statements about men or to attack men when they express how such statements make them feel. And don’t even get me started on how much it hurts that there are people that would try to get others to fear me by default simple because of what’s between my legs.

"The reason why this is happening is because the current trend in our society is uplifting women by putting down men. The majority of people are sheep and the government, the consumer industry, the entertainment industry, the media, and social media all know this and use it to their advantage to control people. The reason why all these outlets are doing this is that they know females are the biggest consumers and spenders of money, so they will do whatever kind of manipulation to get on females sides to have them spend more money in anyway possible. Women are so easily indoctrinated to follow whatever trends that are current at time because they are naturally biological followers. 

We are seeing more misandry and man hating now because this is societies attempt to get more men to conform by shaming men to the point of submitting to the gynocentric agenda they are pushing, this is why you see misandry being glorified and misogyny being vilified. What everyone has to understand is that the media is controlled and regulated by the government, so if all the media outlets are controlled by the government and people are controlled by the media, essentially people are controlled by the government. 

The reason I say all of this is because I am a man that has always been an very observant person and opened my mind to see things from the outside looking in. I see the blatant misandry and female empowerment that has flooded our society in recent years and it's easy to put those two together to see what the agenda is and the narrative they are pushing. This is how the government wants to control people by indoctrinating and brainwashing them with this narrative until it just becomes the norm.

The media is going to force feed female empowerment in every way possible which is why you see more and more things being feminized in the movies and on TV. You see the shaming tactics being used on men by putting shaming labels on a man if he is a certain way or does certain things that aren't masculine and don't live up to what society considers masculine or manly.

"the question you need to ask yourself when you see those things is ""is that me? am i part of the problem?""

seeing someone say ""men are awful they mistreat women"" can certainly hurt, and you are entirely valid in feeling that way. we can't control our feelings as they're just not rational and instead rooted in things much deeper than our rational mind. what you DO with that feeling, however, is a choice and can lead to self-reflection and growth. you may say no, i dont mistreat women, but as a straight cisgender man, there could absolutely be blind spots where you may unknowingly be causing harm or perpetuating patriarchal attitudes that do hurt and mistreat women.

the thing is its very, very easily for those who don't want to hear that message to see something qualified appropriately and then go ""that's not about me!"" when it actually is. we see a lot of men who mistreat women in say, ""manosphere"" type spaces who very much mistreat women but fully deny doing so, even though the message is directed at them. people sloganize things because it gets the message out there that there is a problem, and those who then want to engage with that message get to move beyond the intro course into an actual discussion of ""here is what we mean"". it's a lot easier and snappier to say ""men suck for hurting women"" than ""there are a great deal of men who cause women pain, whether by overt misogyny or through more subtle means such as ignoring the impact of this pain, that all work to perpetuate societal and structural pressure and oppression on women"". 

more often than not, what is shared it shared from a place of personal experience and pain. men have hurt the people who say these things in a whole myriad of ways. so approach it with empathy, for both that person and yourself. understand that they are allowed to feel hurt for what they experienced, and ask yourself if what they're describing is something you might be doing. then, rather than allowing than internalizing that, go ""okay, i dont want to be that person, let me see what i can do better so im not that person"". you will not only show yourself to be an empathic ally, but also come out as a better person. a win-win that can be easier said than done, but it is very much possible.

also, i would be remiss to not recommend the book i recommend to anyone who self-image and self-worth hurdles. healing the shame that binds you by john bradshaw. he has an hour long talk that gives you the basis of the book that's a good way to see if it resonates with you. https://youtu.be/UBAAgdRHWlM

I on the other hand I don't hold my friends hands , who are girls, except to greet them or a small hug while meeting after a long time, because i know that i have someone special now and I am not interested in such things.

"This is kind of a weird thing to admit, but it's a problem I noticed awhile ago and it makes it hard for me to trust people and make friends. I'm 25M, and I've realized that I don't really have any desire for male friends if I'm being honest with myself.

I have social anxiety which unfortunately makes it hard for me to form relationships in general, but when I think about it, the only relationship I really want outside of my family is a girlfriend. 

I don't know why this is, and it's something I don't like about myself. I want to *want* to be friends with other guys, but something in me just makes me feel intimidated, judged, inferior, and not trusting of them.

My parents divorced when I was young, and I never had a close relationship with my dad (not a bad thing) which I'm sure plays a part, although I've always been close with my grandpa on my mom's side and he has been more like a father to me. Still, I spent most of my time with my mom growing up, so maybe that's why?

When I think about other men, I get this image that they are cold, aggressive, and unforgiving. I don't think that's very fair or accurate, but it's unfortunately the conclusion my mind has come to.

I'd really appreciate some advice on this if possible. It's very strange to feel lonely and also not want to make friends at all. It doesn't even make sense. I want to change this about myself, but I don't really know how.

For me it was working out at the gym. I wanted to want to do it, but I didn’t actually want to do it. Probably because —like you— it was not something I had much exposure to. 

I fixed this by hiring a personal trainer for 10 sessions over 10 weeks. It forced me to go during the week because I didn’t want to have to tell my trainer that I didn’t work out that week, but it also put me in a setting where I wasn’t expected to know what I was doing while learning how to do it. 10 weeks later, the next time I had the feeling of wanting to want to work out, I suddenly actually wanted to work out.

"I think I mentally scared my little brother. He’s twelve years old. We both come from the same broken household, where everyone lacks ambition. There’s no positive father figures (both of our fathers bailed). I try my best to work my ass off because our mother is too poor to afford basic things like toothpaste, and socks and shoes.

I sell cars. I bust my butt day in and day out to provide for him when I can because as the only positive adult in his life (who keeps a job etc). I buy his socks, shoes, pay for everything and it’s honestly a financial feat I don’t have the money for.

Either way, I have a trip to Vegas planned this weekend. It’s my first trip ever (first plane ride too) , and is celebrating my 23rd birthday. I bought a $300 chain as a present to myself less than a week ago . I invited my siblings over (both kids) and come to find out they’d gone into my room and broken this expensive piece of jewelry I had bought for my trip.

"My 2 cents, take it or leave it :)

This sounds like an upsetting situation to go through, and it’s kind of you to try and get advice on how to handle it and share that you did something you regret. That shows that you care about your siblings and want to make things better. 

It’s understandable to be angry after spending that amount of money and having that new chain broken. You’ve said money’s really tight, and that’s a big chunk of change, plus it’s a treat for yourself for your birthday, and it sounds like you work really hard to provide for your little brother and probably don’t get to treat yourself like this much at all. 

IMO, it’s difficult to give advice with things like this because everyone’s different—plus I’m not sure exactly what your goal is—but I suggest taking a few minutes to think about what you want to communicate to your siblings and maybe write a letter out first so you can clarify your thoughts and cover everything you want to say. You could also potentially turn this into a learning opportunity by explaining that sometimes when we feel upset, we do and say things that are hurtful without really meaning them. 

I think one part of being a man/adult is recognizing when we’ve screwed up and owning that, and you’ve taken a big step toward that already. Now it’s time to figure out how to phrase an apology in your own words to your siblings. Maybe explain what was so upsetting, acknowledge that how you communicated (and perhaps assumed they broke the chain intentionally?) was wrong, and let them know that you love them and value your relationship with them even when you’re upset (again: tailor this to your own voice and dynamic with them).

They may still be scared and upset, and try to give them space to feel that. Whatever they feel is valid in the same way that whatever you feel is valid. I believe we have to do our best to control our behaviors, and it seems like you fell short in this specific instance, and that’s ok: you’re human and nobody’s perfect. 

Try not to be too hard on yourself. It isn’t possible to act exactly right all the time, and you’ve had an immense amount of unfair pressure placed upon you by having to be a surrogate father and provider to your little brother at such a young age.

"In response to the question in your subject:  Yes, literally all of us have.  As far as what to do, there's only one thing to do:  apologize.

Also, just a suggestion, it may be better to avoid buying non-essential luxuries like expensive jewelry at this point in your life.  I'm not saying that you don't deserve to enjoy yourself and buy nice things for yourself.  You do.  But when it comes to non-essentials, if you can't afford to lose it, you probably can't afford to buy it.  Jewelry generally is a flex, and spending your money to flex when your income is limited isn't typically a great idea.  This likely factored into why you had such a strong emotional reaction.

We also sometimes have a habit of splurging on material things to make ourselves ""feel good.""  It doesn't really work that way though.  It's a cheap ego boost and doesn't really give us any meaningful fulfillment, and it actually sets us up for emotional stress if it puts us in a bind financially in more important areas, or the stress of losing it or maintaining it, etc.

What she means by that is it's natural that we disagree, and even that we get angry at each other and need to cool off. But don't let it be to the point where you don t speak to each other, or where neither try to understand where the other is coming from. It's ba two way street and it's not to say that you should put up with absolutely everything but just that at the end of the day you are siblings and it's safe to say you don't hate them nor do they hate you or are incapable of seeing where their mistake lie."

"In my life, the thing that gives me the most anxiety is not being 100% certain of something. I like to be in control and be prepared for exactly what's going to happen, but unfortunately reality makes it so that I cannot always know exactly what's going to happen next. To give an example of the extent this goes to, if I buy something online that I don't want anyone I live with to see I will never have it delivered here. I'll always go pick it up, just in case they were to open my package. No one has ever opened a package addressed to me, but I still have that fear because I can't guarantee it's not going to happen.

"I am a 22 yo male, just graduated college last year, and I have had a very normal life with great friends and family, so nothing to speak about there.

However, 4 years ago when i was a freshman in college, i never related to someone more than when I had a friend start getting deep about things he struggles with. And he said for example, he could watch a documentary on something like a pedophile, and then he would start feeling like he could be one too - he’s most certainly not. So when families bring kids on campus, he would switch sidewalks to avoid them in fear he was a pedophile.

What i’m trying to get at is i feel the exact same way and regret not ever talking to someone about this before… i will watch something so incredibly morally reprehensible and disgusting, and although i know i would never do such a thing and i am disgusted at it myself, i just can’t help but associate myself with that evil. I will watch the same thing (like the reason i am posting now is i watched a tiktok on a girl who was held captive and raped by her father for 24 years) and I honestly worry i am that person deep inside. And even though i can say i know I’m not, it’s like I don’t believe it and i am just so disgusted by myself.

I hope someone understands this and can relate, because I really feel hopeless sometimes because i’ll just watch something sickening and start identifying myself as that sickening person even though the worst thing I’ve ever done is get a speeding ticket.

Thanks everyone."	Imaginary_Line_5669	post	19.47635025322061	female	White	0.004478819668292999	na	na	na	1	malementalhealth
"Well, there are active pedophiles. Undoubtedly one of the most despicable forms of human beings. Although their genetically determined dispositions are not their fault, their actions are 100% - and anything possible should be done to keep them away from society, especially children of course.

 Then there are pedophiles who feel those evil urges, but never would act on them in any way and hopefully would seek therapy/guidance from a professional. Again, their genetics is not their fault. But they act responsibly and keep themselves away from potential victims. Often their therapists are the only ones who know of their severe problems.

Then there are people with different amounts and forms of anxiety. Their basic approach to things/events in life often is: ""What if?"". What if I acted in the same way as those villains, just because I am a male as well? What if I jumped down from the visitors platform at the Grand Canyon or the Eiffel Tower? From those 'what if' fears often growing fears derive, that in many cases develop to huge limitations of their quality of life. The real threat that those individuals become villains or jump down from the Eiffel Tower, are zero. From what you've described so far, I assume that your friend and you belong to this group. You never have and never will pose any threat to anybody, except maybe to your quality of life. Also, there are efficient therapies for anxiety, e. g.

"Hi, there's only so much text here, but I can relate to some of it.  I largely patented myself as child, I got into fights and bullied in school, studied well to earn scholarship to university, but made no friends there, and my work is tolerable & provides good income, but little joy.

Do these depressive thoughts or feelings come in waves often? Does motivation comes and go, but suddenly you're weighted by a thought(s)?  I can relate.  Writing helps me get out of those 'funks.'

Learning to have less 'expectation of outcome' may help. You may want friends, casual sex, love, and other things, but sometimes those expectations and desires will only leave us disappointed.  The less you care the more you win.  Also, 'jumping through mediocre relationships.' Ultimately, you decide what you need, want, or will accept out of a relationship with someone else. You decide who is and who is not a part of your life. If she does not meet those basic needs it's perhaps time to end that relationship.

"So I met a ""friend"" here. And I believe he used me. I feel like I became a target once I bought into his pity party. I don't mean to, but because of my big heart, I invest so much of myself into a friend,  even if we just met. If they're in need, I do whatever I can to help. I give time, care, concern, money sometimes. But in my current situation, all I can do is offer emotional support, but that wasn't enough. I know he's struggling financially. But I'm broke! I did cashapp him 20$ that's all I had at the time. 

I've blocked this person because I realized I wasn't the only one who was fighting like heck and donating funds to help. It was that moment when I saw how many people have given money that I felt used. He would post the same post (copy paste) in like 8 subs, like casting a large net yet not taking any advice on resources or advice at all. But would gladly accept cashapp. 
I'd message to check on him. He'd never return the favor. I'd listen to his woes. But I never felt like i could tell him mine. It was definitely one-sided. 

While I was in my own personal hell, I was trying to stomp out the flames in his. Allowing myself to be constantly anxious over someone threatening suicide. Waiting for him to reply to my messages while my adrenaline is pumping (I'm a heart patient) and having palpitations! 

I'm aware that this is my fault. I kept trying to save someone from themselves and thats not my job. But I've truly attempted, myself. And I never want anyone to ever feel what I felt.

"I'm proud of you for being willing to help someone else , a stranger even, with emotional and material support. That's really cool and the world needs more people like that.

I'm also proud of you for recognizing the imbalance and reclaiming your space and setting a boundary to protect yourself.

Also for having the courage to tell your story here, as many people might be too embarrassed or angry or ashamed to acknowledge that they might have made a mistake or gotten fooled.

Not that I think it's a mistake to be compassionate and kind. It is important to learn how to do those things also for ourselves and to balance where our effort and attention goes, so that we don't help others at the expense of our own wellbeing.

I really like this quote a friend told me years ago:

""We're all just walking each other home""

"Throwaway, obviously, as my primary account is very much identifiable. I originally posted this on TrueOffMyChest, as i just needed to get it off my chest. However, it was rejected automatically. that made me feel really good. go figure :D So now i'm posting it here. i hope you don't mind. I need to vent. I don't know what I'm trying to accomplish with this post other than that.

I'm having trouble writing this post. For two reasons: 1. just comparing my story to what I read here makes me think I just need to man up; 2. I've never told anyone this, nor do I have someone to talk to about, but I guess that's the point of this subreddit. I'm not looking for sympathy, I really just want to get this off my chest.

I live in a smallish country. A very corrupt country. I was a journalist. And I stepped on some very wrong toes. A couple of years ago I woke up to police at my door, who dragged me out and arrested me. Yeah, fun times. Without getting into too many details of the case, as it would be very recognisable to my fellow countrymen, the guy I wrote about didn't like it, so he accused me of trying to extort him. And he's at the top of the corruption pyramid. What followed was a media spectacle making me out to be a criminal, which was very confusing to me as my colleagues very well knew the accusations were false, but said sorry buddy, you know he's the biggest advertiser in the country. The guy then went on a media rampage against me, calling me every name in the book with every media outlet giving him as much space and time as he wanted, followed by ads for his company.

I wasn't too concerned at the time, believing that it would blow over and that the charges will soon be dropped. It's now been four years and the charges are still pending, and I'm a criminal :D My wife took this very hard. Like, very hard. She couldn't understand what and why was happening, but we kinda got through it after i promised her I won't work for any media any more and I'll try to do something else. Right after this whole thing happened we found out she was pregnant with our first child. I was sure it was all turning for the better - we have a kid on the way, I'm finally going to make a change in my work and stop working 15 hour days and we started renovations on our old apartment.

The next three years were kind of hell on earth. I found out who my friends were, the power of money and greed and how difficult it is to try and start a business. I am not a guy that is easily overwhelmed. But this has been too much. I can't get a job in my country, as I am very publicly charged with being a criminal mastermind that extorts people. I can't start a business here as well, as my clients would have seen the same coverage. I tried and tried and tried to start a business with international clients but after three years of trying and absolutely zero success, that's hardly happening. On top of all this our kid can't go to kindergarten yet for a number of reasons, meaning that I have to take care of her all day and then try work at night.

I'm exhausted, I'm defeated, I'm broke and have three, soon to be four liens on my bank accounts - two from banks for unpaid loans in the past two months and one from the government for back taxes which I have no way of paying. We will most likely lose our car very soon. I'm down to two friends, but they are in no position to help me out (not financially, but in any way) as they are dealing with their shit. My parents want to be supportive, but they have their own problems. My wife says it will get better and is trying to stay positive, but I can't help but see the terror in her eyes every time the doorbell rings as she thinks it's the police coming back to re-arest me or the phone rings, thinking it's another call from the bank. I failed as a husband and I'm failing as a father.

For the past month I have woken up every morning with the first thought in my head being: ""will today be the day I end it all?"" And I do want to end it every single day. Then my daughter wakes up and calls for me from her room and I break down crying. Like, sobbing giant tears. Because I don't want her to grow up without a father. I see how much she loves me and it would break my heart if she would have to ask her mom: where's dad. But I'm also scared that she's obviously the only thing stopping me. The urge to convince myself that maybe she doesn't need my shit in her life is very strong. And I know, she's a kid, she doesn't know the shit we have to live in, so she's better off having me in her life. But, you know, is she? That urge is very strong.

Again, I'm not looking for sympathy, not really looking for anyone to say don't kill yourself. Don't even expect anyone to read this. I just wanted to get this off my chest and put it out there, as I have absolutely nobody to speak to about this. And it hurts just to type it all out, let alone talk about it. Took me an hour and multiple crying breaks.

My approach would be to analyze my situation and try to find causes. For all those causes of my findings which I think I might be able to change, I'd go further on, like defining what I want, how much I'm willing to invest etc. In the end there probably will be some sort of plan. In the past it seemed to be helpful if i broke those plans into tiny steps - as tiny as necessary to make them easy, so they didn't build up new barriers. Sometimes it helped if I put my ideas into a written plan, flow chart etc. - seeing my achievements there sometimes gave me some motivating positive feedback.

"Remember that you are not alone in the mental struggle. And it doesn't matter if other people are in a worse situation than you, you are in your own battle and it's all about you taking things in small steps and praising yourself for achieving these small goals. It doesn't matter how quickly you improve, even if it's a gentle slope to increase mental strength, it will get easier in the long run.

Do these things the best you can: Eat, sleep, keep hydrated with water and try to do some exercise on a frequent basis (walking or gym if possible). These strengthen mental health and make you more resilient to depression and anxiety. It can be hard at first to regulate and stick to a routine, but I believe you can do it and although you won't be fixed, it will give you that extra hand to assist you getting through each day. Every time you do any of these tasks well, praise yourself for it, make yourself feel good about it.

Do this more often than negative responses and you will notice a difference as it breaks the negative cycle.

You aren't going to get help from anyone, however every bit of help you give to yourself now or your future self, will make you feel proud of yourself. 

You will have your own challenges, some harder than other people, but sometimes achieving things with the most difficult challenges is the most satisfying of all. 

You have an ability to find your own path and your own solutions that work for you. You might not see them, but you will discover them in practice.


Last of all, don't compare yourself to other people, everyone is trying to look like they got their stuff together, but you don't know their challenges or struggles behind the curtains. More often than not, the people trying to show that they have their life put together, usually is because they have something negative in their life that they are trying to make up for. 

We are all in the same storm, some people get hit by things harder, but continue to be kind with each other and fight through it."	Prudent_Pea_8751	reply	na	na	na	0.9888916611671448	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"Props to you for being open about all that. If it's any consolation, just by reading your post I can tell your odds of your situation improving are higher than you might think. The fact you've reached out at all to share your struggle shows a healthy level of introspection is going on, despite however else you might be struggling mentally.
So if mental health and employment is the issue, then that narrows down your problem, and you can go from there. But of course it's complex. Whatever mental health issue you've got will make some avenues harder than others, so you're not crazy to feel daunted or overwhelmed. It's more normal than you think.

You don't have to take advice from nobodies on Reddit, but if you do, maybe try:
1. Know where you want to be; try making some long term goals so you know where you want to be, and some short term achievable ones to keep you going in the immediate.
2. Prioritise mental health; if you don't look after yourself mentally, you may struggle to succeed in other parts of your life.
3. Draw support from your network or community; there may be support closer than you think, so try reaching out to people who help those in the community (as and who you're comfortable with), and if you have friends or family who you're still in contact with, ask them for help and support, as they know you best.
4. Physical health; try exercising and eating as healthily as possible. For anyone struggling mentally, keeping physically active and healthy is key to supporting yourself in your endeavours.

"Might just be me, but like do you ever get caught up in the moment with other people and you say rude things etc and you find it funny etc, yet later you regret it a lot, yet you crave for more of the sadness that you felt? I'm a 15M yr old I started feeling this since I was 13,14 but I also don't know whether I could classify myself as suicidal though because you guys know how you get those people who fake Tourettes or something, like I just don't want to like be faking depression, because I have cut myself with a knife a few times not that deep or anything, and I got 21 scars from a compass. 

But also another question is that, compared to earlier in my life I feel happier, but do you guys like feel more desensitized and like ""dumb"". Sorry if this is a rant but I was just wondering? And I find that watching people die is kinda funny yet also calming regardless of the way they die or what they've done wrong, is that normal, because everyone says I'm weird and all? I just feel hopeless but the only reason I've kept myself properly uplifted is that I know people are suffering worse than me so it makes me "" feel better"".

A lot of this stuff anger, impulsivity (saying stupid shit) is hormones and learning to be am adult.

Trying to be more mindful will help with all that. 

There are pretty good apps that will teach you mindfulness meditation, don't be confused though,  that shit is hard and challenging and you'll be confronting dark and difficult parts of yourself.

For the last 7 years my life has been a mess. I tried my best to keep everyone and everything save. But I almost lost every person I really cared about. I still try my best everyday, I work out, go to therapy and eat at least 2 meals a day. I live in a big flat, which belongs to my parents and i dont need to pay except for food and my usual bills. One month ago I lost my job and it really hit me, since then my parents give me money and I feel bad about it. Dont get me wrong, I know i live in very good conditions. I am really thankful for everything what I have, but this also makes me feel really bad. The break-up from my ex still haunts me, the Ptsd and bad memories I have from my abusive brother and the feeling nothing to accomplish makes me depressed. I really dont want to feel like this anymore and i cant change it. I feel my heart breaking everyday and bad memories and dreams haunting me while i sleep (If i get sleep). I dont want to keep going like this and every attempt i take to change, knocks me down back to the bottom where i started.

It sounds like you're going through a very difficult time right now, and I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling so much. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and hopeless when you're dealing with so many challenges and difficult emotions.

However, it's important to know that there is hope for you, and that things can get better. You don't have to face this alone, and there are people and resources that can help you.

Here are a few suggestions that might be helpful:

Seek professional help: It sounds like you're already going to therapy, which is a great step. If you're not already, you might consider seeing a mental health professional who specializes in PTSD and trauma. They can help you work through the difficult memories and emotions you're experiencing, and develop coping strategies to manage them.
Connect with others: Isolation can make depression and anxiety worse, so it's important to stay connected with others. This might include joining a support group, volunteering, or finding a social group that shares your interests.
Take care of your physical health: Eating healthy food, getting enough sleep, and exercising can all help improve your mood and reduce stress. You're already working out, so keep it up, and consider adding other healthy habits to your routine.
Practice self-compassion: It's easy to be hard on yourself when you're going through a tough time, but it's important to treat yourself with kindness and understanding. Try to be gentle with yourself, and acknowledge that it's okay to struggle.
Remember, healing takes time, and it's okay to take things one day at a time. You don't have to have everything figured out right away. Keep reaching out for help and support, and know that things can get better."	Subject-Metal6645	reply	na	na	na	0.9956943988800049	strong	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"You’re lacking in purpose brother. You’re living a life where things are provided for you so you feel like you haven’t earned them.

You string together 3 good days only for it to fall apart in minutes I’m guessing?

You need to start small doing kind things for people and after a few days of a week of that, you need to take on some onerous tasks to challenge yourself to rise to the occasion.

Like a fish, lizard, snake, etc., you’ll only grow as large as the cage you’re in. Write out a list of principles and follow them to a T. That’s your mantra, your ethos, your creed. You live your life according to this code you create for yourself. That will give you discipline and then you can periodically revise it but you don’t waver from it."

"Ugh. Where do I begin? 
Got married almost two years ago, and overall our marriage is good. 
Since we've married, on my second job which is finally allowing me to pay the bills and even have a couple hundred dollars left over at the end of the month. 
Now, I'm feeling down because I see people my age (not friends, well call them acquaintances) buying homes (yes In this sellers market), having kids, and just overall doing well. I just turned 30, so perhaps it's a 1/3rd life crisis.
Anyway, I've been super stressed and have had couple of panic attacks (didn't have any in a couple years) due to my mother living 8 states away, and becoming a recluse. My brother isn't so close to her, and she is suffering. It's hard for me to take off work, especially since I started this new job 6 weeks ago. 
I've gone into a new low, I finish work at 3 and sleep...and still tired when I wake up.

"Hey man, thank you for sharing this here. You’re not alone. I’m sorry to hear about the stress you’re dealing with and that your mom is suffering. 

As far as supporting your mom, I’d suggest the analogy of putting on your own oxygen mask first. It’s really tough to support someone else when you’re in a constant state of stress, so be gentle with yourself and take care of you.

More specifically with your mom, leveraging technology if she’s able and willing to stay in touch. My mom and I exchange a daily good morning text, just to let each other know we’re there. Can you plan a trip to see her, can you video call her once a week or once a month? Can you and your brother brainstorm some ideas for your mom?

Last thing I can say is to be kind to yourself. Try to be patient with yourself, and if you feel yourself spiraling, you need to reach out to someone. The hardest part in the process of getting the help you need is reaching out.

I hope you stay strong, and know that things won’t always be so difficult. You can get through it, and you’re worthy of happiness, just gotta keep trying."	FloridaPhil93	reply	na	na	na	0.9920541048049927	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

We can offer a casual place to hangout, how to figure yourself out, we can offer peer support when it comes to mental health issues, we can help you with social skills, self-esteem and issues that are often looked over and brushed away when it comes to men.

Let’s find ways to encourage each other to be better men, healthier men, more positive, understanding and supportive men. Men that are not looking to flex, ridicule and pull down others, but rather be a positive force in their own lives as in the lives of others. 

We aren't any professionals, just regular men looking for a more positive environment among other men.

"I have been holding this down my chest for too long, I just want to pour things out, I am lonely, and I don’t have anyone to talk to. Not even people close to me can understand. This is getting very exhausting and draining. 

I am 20 years old. I have been a victim of abuse and bullying for my entire childhood, I suffer from emotional damage caused by my family, and just when I thought it would get better when I enter the outside world, I was definitely wrong. I was physically and verbally bullied at school, for 7 years until I joined university, it sort of stopped, however, outside the school circle I still get bullied, I feel like it will never go away. 

I have always been portrayed as the weakest, most fragile and sensitive among my peers. I was the one who has always been the easiest to be picked up on, because of my weight. My severe depression and anxiety made me lose ton of weight, thus becoming fragile and not functioning. 

Nobody cared, not even school counselors, headmaster, teachers, etc.. I always reached for help to no avail. My bullies have never been punished, or get grounded for their behavior, not even by their parents. 

I felt hopeless my entire life, I was so eager to be done with highschool, and when I went to university I felt so relieved. Little did I know bullying would never stop, it always follows you around. 

I developed C-PTSD, depression, anxiety, OCD and ADHD due to my severe bullying outside and inside my house. I am now remembered as “the person who got his ass beat on a regular basis” by my hometown. I am ashamed of myself to even go outside, the anger that’s built up inside me cannot be comprehended. I pity myself, how were I not able to stand up for myself, how I always sat and let the abuse happen to me. 

This world is awful, I don’t wish this on my worst enemy, everything inside me is shattered, my self esteem, self love, my identity, my living purpose. I wish I could stop existing. Being a man didn’t help either, I was always told to be a man and bottle things up, or sometimes I’m a man I should’ve defended myself."	ahmedduh	post	19.973777997164333	male	White	0.9980428218841553	na	na	na	5	malementalhealth

"I'm not very well with words but I'ma try and resonate with you. When I was in middle school I was heavily bullied, but my bullies were mainly girls. Yeah I was in a few fights with guys boys cause I grew up rough and I can take a hit. The verbal abuse was hard on me tho. I couldn't fight back cause they were girls and I wasn't quick witted with words to defend myself. The depression was physically painful. Going back I was thinking to myself I would fight every single day then feel this, hell I would rather be sexually molested than feel this type of pain. 

Going into highschool. I would watch a lot of anti sjw/ redpill content to try and find why I was so teased and abused the way I was. The videos would tell me it was my fault, but I had the power to change that. My depression turned into anger and bitterness. I wanted nothing but revenge for the way they treated me. All it did for me was turn into the same asshole than like the ones in middle school. I regret the way I treated people. I was scared to be seen as that kid from middle school. I put on this big tough personality and I regret it. 



Now I'm 23. Going to therapy, and hoping and praying I would find answers to why i was treated like so. Why after a decade I still wanted to physically hurt a 5'2 120lbs girl that used to be my bully. Why am I still thinking about the past. Finding my own conclusions I want to share my answers with you,   you'll not like them, but this is what has been helping me heal.



There will never be an answer to you were treated the way your were. Your bullies will long forget about you. Even if you someday confront them and demand an apology, it won't change anything. The past is the past, it's already been done. Please cry about it, let out that emotion, sit in it, don't let it fester and turn into something you'll regret. If you have the means please talk to someone about this. You making this post is a giant step to healing, you being vulnerable made me vulnerable. You are beautiful and deserving of love and affection. At some point, as much as it hurts, I hope you let go of the pain, and be able enjoy you life the way you want.

And if you talk negatively in your own mind, you're going to have a bleak view of life and people around you--including yourself. This may also bleed into you becoming a toxic person to others around you. 

So what's the best way to combat this? For me, I've found that complimenting myself on a daily basis (I average around 12 self-compliments per day and count said compliments on a [lap counter](https://www.amazon.com/Oligei-Counter-Four-Digit-Handheld-Counting/dp/B09GM56893/ref=sr_1_8?crid=1OI32Z5979Q0&keywords=lap+counter&qid=1676562563&sprefix=lap%2520counter%2Caps%2C102&sr=8-8)) has really turned things around. Fake it until you make it applies here. This self-love ideology needs to be applied in tandem with removing *just one* negative thought per day. Start with just re-framing one negative thought with a positive self-compliment. The next day, work it up to two and so on. Over time, the negative thoughts you have in your head, which will still pop up btw, will seem alien and weird, as you'll have become more accustomed to positive self-thoughts as the norm. This will help you banish the negative thoughts more quickly when they arise, which is the whole damn deal--you clear out the clutter. One step at a time, brother. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Growing up with ADHD, I unfortunately got bullied by quite a lot of people growing up (still do to a degree, even as a 21 year old man). Something that I’ve come to realize about myself is that I find women to be somewhat intimidating, and I’ve always asked myself why. I did some searching and came to understand that it’s because growing up, the things that the girls that bullied me said/did to me affected me far more than the men, and it lies mostly in the fundamental differences between how boys/girls bully people. I distinctly remember being around 4 years old and bursting into tears over something a girl said to me and being so embarrassed. Boys are far more consistent with the way they bully and primarily rely on mockery. Girls, on the other hand, are more blunt and tend to say things that are *true*. A girl would typically say something to you that they *knew* would hurt you. A guy would say something to me that would hurt at the moment, but I’d move past it. A girl would say something that won’t hurt me in the moment but as I sit and thought about it, I think “fuck, that really hurt my feelings.” It also feels like a social and biological disapproval with women, because I feel as if I’m being looked down as a person and as a man. Now, I feel this massive fear of being judged by women and i just wish I could move past it.	rickjames334	post	9.766121816414458	male	White	0.006760920397937298	na	na	na	10	malementalhealth

"I don't know if it's really the words that were said that are truly hurtful, but the context in where, how and why they were said that added to it. From what I remember hearing, the brain relies on emotion more then raw information. 

So this part sucks (cause revisiting it sucks) but through therapy, you can revisit those emotions and weaken the link until it's stops hurting. There's a new form of therapy, EMDR and I've heard good things about it. It's apparently more effective then talk therapy (classic) and less re-traumatizing. If you can, give that a shot.

Humans are social creatures, and part of living in a society is controlling your words and actions to get along well and be liked by others. That said, your concerns have clearly evolved into full-on anxiety, and I would dare to bet from your decision to include a childhood story that the anxiety is partly/entirely trauma driven.

Thankfully, therapy is really good at helping you process past trauma and reprocess them to avoid anxiety and subsequently interact normally with all members of society.

"This is a question I have about myself.  Basically I know what my problems are, and I know my life would be exponentially better if I would just do the basic things that I need to do to better myself.  However, for some fucked up mental reason I cannot.  

Let me start by saying my life is not hard.  Its not bad and there is nothing I have to complain about thats any worse than any other average person here.  In fact my life is probably better than most others on this planet.  (I say I am grateful but maybe i am not......)  

This piece of shit --> Me a single 43 a year old male man child who cant get their shit together and has been contemplating moving on from this planet daily for the past year.  (Fortunately for the handful of people that seem to tolerate me; my children keep me from making good on that promise.)

The shit I have to do.... most of it is not hard, none of it is a mystery and most of it wont even take me that long......  I really have zero fucking excuses to not do the things i have to (basically an irresponsible man child.)  

The problem I have is I BLOODY KNOW IT, but even with knowing it, talking to myself about it I STILL ""CHOOSE"" NOT TO (I put choose in quotations because in reality I am making the choice not to, Im not a puppet.  However it is weird because sometimes its like I cannot control the choice....  i know, cant really wrap my head around that either, hence the question to the dangerous internet advice.  No i dont think im possessed or anything.  Nor do i believe anyone or thing is controlling me.  Whatever my problem is, its all me.)

99.9% would say grow the fuck up or man the fuck up and take care of business, and they're right...... I even say that to myself constantly, in the mirror, when I attempt to meditate, and when I write it down in hopes some affirmation shit will help.

I just cannot figure out why I get home after work and just sit there, I walk my dog and then make reluctantly make something to eat, then I just sit there, alone, in the dark.  I have stuff to do, but i wont.  I make impulsive decision on eating and/or purchasing things.  So I've made my financial health a nightmare.

Ive got nothing to be depressed about or sad about.  Ive got nothing physically from doing anything in this world.  I am not stupid but I am not smart.  I am your average middle aged man who is lost and cant get back.

I need to find out why I refuse to do the things that will better my life, mentally, financially and physically?

Apart from the obvious suggestion to seek mental health professional help, better if they can prescribe medication,  I would suggest to take a different approach to yourself not taking good care of yourself. You don't owe anybody doing things that will increase your well being. Don't beat yourself up for it. Instead of aiming to do all the not so hard things that you are not doing, just do some of them. Maybe you are getting overwhelmed by the sheer amount of those little things that 'mature adult' should be doing and it is fine. Pick one thing that you are constantly procrastinating and do it. Maybe start the next thing if you feel up to it. Do some physical excercise no matter how little, it will make your mind more grounded. Again, do not push hard, make a very small goal, achieve it and do a little extra if you feel like it only. The goal is to create a helpful habbit, listen to podcasts or music or whatever puts you at ease while doing it.	TurbulentKitchen7024	reply	na	na	na	0.9976819753646851	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

they asked questions to see if I was depressed, also asked me to do a test for thyroid issues, 
and referred me to a psychiatrist to be checked. 

with a thyroid family history I suspected it may be the case, I was told I had minor depression, and later after more evaluation I got diagnosed with ADHD which made perfect sense when I looked into it, been getting medications and it's been better.

"I relate hard core to this. Like in reality my life is pretty good. I'm 24, have a pretty decent apartment, one roommate who I really like. A somewhat stable job, pay's not great but I get by, I have minimal debt. 

But I know I could do so much more than scrape by, and if I did I wouldn't be so stressed and depressed by living paycheck to paycheck. I have 1/2 a bio degree and 1/2 a chem minor. If I would just set up appointments to get back on my meds, I could go back and finish my degree and get a job I actually enjoy and doesn't make me feel useless. If i stopped spending so wrecklessly to save money for surgery I need, my dysphoria would be so much better. But I just don't do these 2 simple things (appointment and not spending so much) to even get to the big goals to better my life (school and surgery) 

 Those two aspects of my life make me so heavily suicidal despite my life being pretty good, especially compared to the rest of the world; yet I don't do them

I've chalked my problem up to being content in my own ""slight misery"". Growing up I was forced to be ""ok"" with being SUPER miserable, and got used to it. When I moved out for college I became an addict and again was super miserable through addiction and getting sober. Now that I'm only slightly miserable, it doesn't seem too bad. 

My mind would rather take the small pleasures of not paying for doctors and meds that I don't like, and letting my AuDHD brain buy myself things and some weed (reducing my usage gradually) for the slightest bit of serotonin. All because being slightly miserable is so much more relaxed than before

I always feel lethargic and tired and drained yet I don’t do anything physically demanding so I shouldn’t feel like this and I reluctantly do my chores and the necessities to keep my life going but then will lay down and scroll on my phone for hours not doing anything productive and I hate myself for it but lack any discipline or motivation to fix it I guess. Suicide is an often reoccurring thought that I have as the way I view it is almost like I romanticize the thought of it because if I go through with it, it means everything is over no more stress or worry no more disappointment just peace and bliss. Only reason I haven’t done it is because of my family and how much they care about me. They haven’t given up on me but I have given up on myself. That said I know that there is realistically ways that I can better my life but I just can’t seem to. If you find out a way to fix this let me know.

"As one might expect on a sub dedicated to help and support, I've noticed that many folks on this sub suffer with having a sense of worthiness, love and belonging.  The discussions often center around factors like height, weight, attractiveness, fitness, money, etc.  ""It's hard to be accepted and loved in this world because I'm too short or unattractive.  Attractive people have it so easy!""

So what is the key to having a strong sense of worthiness, love and belonging?  Is it height?  Attractiveness?  Money?  Intelligence?  Researcher and social worker Brené Brown had this same question, and so she decided she was going to spend a year researching this topic in order to get to the bottom of it.  

Well, one year turned into six.  She collected an absurd amount of data - thousands of stories, hundreds of long-form interviews.  She she determined that there was only one single variable common in all people that had a strong sense of worthiness, love and belonging.  What was that variable?  Were they all attractive?  Did they all come from supportive families?

The variable common in all people that had a strong sense of worthiness, love and belonging was this:  they all ***believed*** they were worthy of love and belonging.

That's it.  They had it, because they believed it.  There was no other commonality in their background, history or circumstances.  Just that.  They *felt* love and belonging because they *believed they were worthy of it*.

It calls to mind the cliché ""You have to love yourself before you can love others.""  Now as someone pointed out to me recently, that's a reductive statement.  Well yes, of course it is.  You can't summarize the entire human condition in ten words.  But as we're navigating through our lives, sometimes we need some quick direction in a pinch.  It doesn't need to be perfect, but it needs to point us back in the right general direction.  That statement can help serve as a signpost for us.

Our happiness, our sense of love and belonging -- it's not dependent on external factors.  It's dependent on us - on our belief of whether we're worthy of love and belonging.  And we are.  You are.  

But none of us will ever achieve that if all of our analysis involves looking at other people.  Having this sense of worthiness  does not require looking at other people - it requires looking at ourselves.  Self-reflection.  Our validation must come from inside us.

"Recently, I heard some stand-up on the radio where a comedian said he had ""resting rich face"" and economic dysmorphia.  He implied everyone just assumes he's successful and gives him an attitude, or worse gets angry when he brings out a coupon or something.  

I too believe that people only seem to care about me when I'm doing well, which at 35 has often just come down to luck, and it seems society doesn't even try to enable a healthy support system for men's mental health so that we can not rely on luck.  Team sports, dating rituals, boss/employee dynamics, and popular hobbies all seem like they just expect men to be stupid and easily manipulated immature boys.  And it definitely doesn't help that my avg height and generally non-threatening stature don't change people's assumptions of thinking I'm immature.  But I've tried this phrase, I have resting rich face out recently. It seemed to disarm the stranger, to reconsider I'm a Bill Murray-esque irreverent spendthrift and instead  I'm an avg male where money is something to me that I put in terms of time worked to earn that money.  I'm not saying that would work on a closer family member that has long ago mentally blocked out ever treating me as a fragile emotional person but on a day where I'm running errands it's making my interactions with cashiers a lot better and I feel seen a bit more at the end of the day.     
But yeah, its pretty fucked that I'm sure you'll agree, the people who know me the most are the worst at assuming I'm money-bags Murray, heck I'm even the youngest child, but I've got two older sisters who had drunk the ""feminist Karen"" juice and brainwashed my parents too, not that my parents weren't easily manipulated being a part of the boomer generation of Americans where things generally were okay with finding, staying at jobs, staying out of dept, growing savings, etc was a piece of cake.

a few years ago, I heard a different comedian say something that has always stuck with me.  He was from the middle-east, I cannot remember who exactly. He said something like there's a stereo-type that his culture is ""full of cheap bastards"" that haggle on price everywhere they go.  But the punchline was... something like... I hear all the time "" the Muslims, the Mexicans, and Jews are cheap, etc. etc ...or maybe, AMERICANS ARE JUST FUCKING INSANELY IRRESPONSIBLE WITH MONEY, and the REST OF THE WORLD is normal!!   Yeah! I'd say this for the most part. I'm half hispanic but essentially was raised very much American, living in America, living in a suburb where 90% of people were essentially white and multi-generation american, and grew up in the 90s where there wasn't all the ""woke"" casting choices that you see today.  But I have indulged in that Hispanic side more recently, which as Ive said isn't that much of a leap when I went through years of struggling and now that I'm just another average rat living in a city there's more of a Hispanic population around me and like I said the ""making a budget and rat race"" mentality is something that is accepted as normal life to them and I alike.  Sorry, that just the setup.  my point is that I too would be just as depressed as you and was. until I finally got out of that suburb.  There is very little healthy reactions beside despair now with the anti-leading-man everything in entertainment, including just watching how undervalued male anchors are on news so that I've sometimes just switched to the Spanish channel, knowing I'm just gonna be staring at my phone screen anyway and passively hearing what's going, and the important stuff is still learned visually like weather or traffic.  So anyway, I took a little Spanish in high school, but I have also watched a few game shows or telenovelas (again, passively) in the last few years, and re-learned a bit, and one day I had a breakthrough noticing that Spanish telenovelas get a stereotype of being predictable and poorly acted, but I turned the channel back to an English one and it was Law and Order, a critical darling. And realized it's all a matter of perception.  If you didn't know what the characters were saying on L&O you'd be like... wow, over-dramatic music, actors chewing the scenery, almost no wide-shots-just close-ups to capture ""the tension"" lol, that is a soap opera if I've ever seen one.

  Sorry, I guess this is getting off topic of your mental health. I guess my point is to stop watching entertainment that is all just feeding into the American cultural establishment.  I called a female doctor rude the other day, cause she was rude, she didn't listen to my story and filled out my ""account of the injury"" wrong.

"I am an average 5'10 male.  I know many guy friends 5'3-5-8 as well. I often do think that men that are shorter than average are the MOST discriminated against ever. Way more than non-white races. Imo. 
I try to stand up for these guys all the time and downplay height in general, (Literally don't say 1 word about it), especially when I'm around them. Because honestly it really DOESN'T & SHOULDN'T matter at all. 

It makes me mad when I hear dating women say, ""Height is important to me"".

"I feel this hard core. I have one guy friend that reaches out to check on me (he's the most aware of my mental health struggles) and a couple friends who are women that reach out, but all of them only do so when if affects them. They'll ask if I'm ok when we are hanging out and I'm not enteraining enough. Or they want to go out with me but I keep having to say no because I don't have enough money that week. 

I work 40+ hours a week, every week and I'm barley making it with bills, and my schedule is shit so it rarley lines up with my friends. So I often feel isolated and alone. Most of my guy friends don't seem to care if I'm suffering, but for all I know they are too. I feel like a lot of us feel alone because most guys don't talk about their emotions with one another, so we mostly don't know when each other are struggling. If I knew my buddy was struggling I would reach out, but they never do. Only women tell me they're struggling in life.

I'm honestly just starting to weed people out. I don't need people in my life that I don't care if I'm around or struggling.

"Working out is something you have to do with discipline, not motivation.

Literally everyone who goes to the gym regularly has days where they don't feel like going, but if you rely on motivation or only going when you feel like going, that fades away quickly and soon you'll stop going altogether.

Biggest thing I learned in life is you can't let your feelings and emotions affect your actions otherwise it leads to doing something you regret and ruining your life!

You said you ""would like to look better to improve my own opinion of myself, that seems to get worse with each passing month"" - so then you have to start going to the gym and eating healthy regardless of how you feel.

After years of wanting to start working out again I finally just joined Planet Fitness.  It’s 5 minutes away and $15/month.  This is after buying a home weight set I used maybe 5 times, dip/pullup bar, and treadmill that I used twice and now sits in a closet.  I just made myself go to PF for 20 minutes and do 5 machines for a few weeks.   I was sore as hell but the soreness is now gone and it’s part of my week.  I just needed an easy way in.  After you go a few times it gets easier and becomes routine.  I wish you luck; it was hard for me to put down the game controller and just go.  But it’s possible.

"I've noticed that getting there and getting inside is the hardest part for me. Once I get there and I'm inside the building, working out doesn't seem so bad.

Way to work up a sweat 😃👍"" and that gets me to go. I also will sign up for 1 or 2 classes a week and being on the sign up list gives me some sort of accountability and introduces me to new workouts that I may enjoy

That and doing things that I actually enjoy as a workout. Longboarding 14+ miles, cross country skiing, hockey, stealing my sister's dog and taking him for a jog. Going to a gym and walking on a treadmill staring at a wall and repetitively lifting weights can get really boring and makes me want to go less, so fun activities help.

"Honestly I think you're exaggerating a little bit when it comes to your outlook on life. Being skinny having bad eyesight and thinning hair isn't a deal breaker for all women. I would say your problem to women comes in the attitude you have. Generalizing all women like that isn't going to help you at all, women CAN tell when a guys mindset is thinking like you are. Like you said they can see it in how you carry yourself, treat and look at them. Take it from me, I used to be the short skinny guy with glasses, that spent all his time in his dorm studying, that ""no woman could ever find attractive"". I bulked up, and now am starting to cut (bulk and cut is a good way to gain muscle I feel, women also like a dad bod. For the bulk part), I found glasses that accentuate my looks better and also invested in contacts.  I worked on my confidence in myself, liking things about myself. Found hobbies I enjoyed and was confident talking to women about (longboarding, drawing, skiing, volleyball, instruments). Working on myself was the thing. I stolped talking so mych shit about myself and stopped projecting it on woman and eventually a wonderful woman, way out of my league gave me chance and we had an amazing relationship for 2 1/2 years. when my hair started thinning last year I bought minoxidil, that shit's growing back in pretty well. 

Even if you don't ""improve"" your looks, I see men who have the same physical qualities as you who have girlfriends/boyfriends/spouses. It's not the end of the world. Finding someone takes a really long time for most guys. 

Please try and focus on loving yourself first, because even if you get a gf, you'll still hate the way you look if you don't improve your mindset and/or looks. it'll make finding love a lot easier too because women will see the change in you.

"As men, we are unfortunately evolutionarily disposable. Men compete against men (let it be known that women face many of the same competitions in different ways). We all compete for resources, status, etc. 

Think of the millions of different animals who wanted to reproduce who did not get to. The dinosaur who was not strong enough. The butterfly not colored vibrantly enough. The bird who could not build a suitable enough nest. The monkey in the jungle who was not confident enough. 

  
Sometimes, the first step is to really accept the truth. See the evolutionary bloodbath for what it is. See the cruelty but also the wonder of reality. 

  
You are not very desirable in the evolutionary market. 

Now, you need to optimize like your life depends on it. Go bald or get some kind of hair transplant. Get jacked (and I know this one is hard as a fellow skinny guy, so at least get lean jacked). Get a career that can allow you to support a family (you may never get the Hollywood hook-up, but you could get the family). If you can not find a women in the local environment, then you need to look in foreign locations. This is easier than ever with Tinder. There is Tinder in nearly every nation out there. They may not genuinely love you, but they may accept you at as a meal ticket. Sure, the love will be fake and people will say this is wrong. But, this is evolution. Everything is fair game in evolution (think about the Cuckoo bird). If you make it this far, you can have kids and give your child a better chance at life since clearly your parents failed you by your own admission. Then, you can take pride in watching your sons or daughters get some of the luxuries you never had. 

  
Frankly, if you cannot perform these steps in some capacity, then you shall fail and die alone. If you want to be selfish and only desire hookups, true love, etc., then you  deserve to fail, because it shows your genes lack the intelligence to accurately access your situation and re-calibrate.

"Deriving your self worth from people who don't appreciate you is the quickest way to an unfulfilling life, and having the acceptance of others as a barrier to giving yourself permission to appreciate yourself just ensures that will never happen regardless of who is in your life or not.

Sure there is a lot of women who are only attracted to strict adherence to male gender roles, but there's also a lot of women who aren't. The issue is that having no appreciation for yourself is a nearly universal turnoff in all relationships to all people.

I used to be depressed and alone, and I through that was because I was awkward, chubby and non-masculine, so I tried for years to change all those parts of me without success.

"I feel like friends are pulling away from me and I’m trying to figure out what (if anything) to do about it

Over the last year and half I’ve been feeling a lot of my different friend groups pulling away from me and I’m having a hard time making sense of it. Maybe it’s not deliberate but just flakey. Maybe they’ve got their own issues and I’m just being paranoid. Or maybe they are for reasons I just don’t understand. 

As I try to make sense of it, the other question that comes up is to what degree I do something about it or just let it go. If there’s something I’m doing that’s driving people away I would want to know, but then there might just be the reality of what’s on the ground that I just need to accept and move on. 

I think the part about it that stings is that I’ve always been the type to try to bring people together, create fun times for friends and make connections. Some of the friend groups that I feel pulling away were brought together by me in the past. That part really burns. 

Some examples… 

There was an event coming up that I was excited about and looking for friends to go with. I texted three friends that were part of a larger group with a link and just asked “Hey! Any of you interested in going to this?”

Nobody responded to that text. I considered not going but ended up going on my own. When I got there that whole group of friends was there. They said things like “we figured you’d be here” and seemed gracious to see me, but it still bothered me that nobody thought to reply to my text…

There was another instance with another group of friends where I suggested a hike/nature walk to an area that’s know for a specific natural phenomenon at a specific time of year. Again, no response on that one, but the weekend I suggested the hike, some of the people ended up going on their own and posting pictures of it on instagram but nobody bothered to message me to join… 

Then! To top it all off another person (whom I would consider a friend) threw a pretty good size party. People from both friend groups I had reached out to in the above examples went. Even though I had texted both of those groups trying to set up and create something fun, nobody sent a text or invited me to this… 

On one hand, if that’s the way it is, that’s the way it is. I’ll accept this and move on. 

But I’m also wondering if there’s still room to think that maybe my text got buried, they forgot and would be genuinely apologetic about it, one person thought another person would respond and then nobody responded, or some other reason that might be reasonable when I hear it.

Part of me that wants to message one or two people that I perhaps feel closest to within these groups and just ask if there’s something going on, if I’ve upset somebody or if there’s a reason I’m not being included… but all that feels very needy and potential to backfire too. 

Another part of me is wondering if maybe it’s not deliberate, but just being inconsiderate. If that's the case, is the inconsideration terminal to the relationship and I just need to move on in this case too.

I can deal with all of that but I’m not excited about it. At this point in my life (mid-40s) making friends isn’t exactly the easiest thing to do. And it’s also frustrating that I had made quite a bit of an investment in these friends only to be getting blown off at this point. It doesn't have me excited about the prospect of seeking out new friends. 

Anyways, I’m curious to hear how folks deal with losing connection or getting pushed out of friend groups. To what degree do you fight it vs accept it and move on? 

tl;dr: there have been a handful of instances were friends didn't respond back to texts or invite me to parties. Did they forget? Were they being inconsiderate? Or do I need to move on?"	rococo78	post	30.783417863189285	male	White	0.9961785078048706	na	na	na	4	malementalhealth

"I'm looking for ways I can better support him.

Last week he was told he was on track to fail his course, and he's massively spiralled. He has performance issues with academia, work, personal, you name it, and this occasion triggered every single one. In his words, he's worthless, only good for showing how much better people are than him, and hopes he won't wake up. Now he has the ""yips"" and has lost motivation to do much except doomscroll.

He IS currently in therapy, but honestly knowing how he's been in couples therapy before I'm worried he's playing down how bad he feels.

We've been together since we were 17 - there's some heavy codependency, to be honest. We're good with being each other's life but during times like this it gets hard. I heavily mirror his emotions and if one of us is down, we're both down, if that makes sense. He's been the strong one throughout - I think it helped him distract from his own issues to help me - so seeing him like this is freaking me out a little, which is not helping.

I'm researching active listening with Movember.com and working on being present with him, but it's scary when he says things like he doesn't want to be here. I think I need to start distancing myself, with love, and put on my own oxygen mask first so to speak, so I'm more of a rock for him (and more stable for me)?

For example, I've just come to the gym while he's sad at home. I told him I love him, gave cuddles, asked if he'd like to come along (no) and if there's anything he wants me to pick up (no). It feels wrong because:

1. I should be trying harder to make him happy: he isn't happy so I didn't try hard enough so I don't deserve the gym
2. It's fucking lonely doing stuff without him, we don't get a ton of time together so I'd rather be doomscrolling with him on the sofa even if it's a depression out
3. I should be putting him first, that's what good partners do

(Typing all these out: yeah, I hear how unhealthy it sounds.)

I feel awful because I'm asking internet strangers if there's anything more I can do and how to cheer up my own husband. The fact is we've fallen into an unhealthy dynamic where he always soothed me and never vice versa, so I never learned. I'm just trying to be a better wife. He says I'm a great one but it's more like ""I don't deserve you"" and I can tell his trauma is speaking a bit there.

Men: if you're going through an awful time, how do you wish your partners supported you? How can you maintain a healthy distance from someone who's really struggling, the closest person in your entire life, and will that even really help?

I feel like a fucking alien learning how to human right now. I've done this man a massive disservice by not learning this sooner. Please help me help him, and thanks for any advice you have."	PitifulParfait	post	19.26432665052981	female	White	0.9978914856910706	na	na	na	15	malementalhealth
"So it sounds to me like your husband is tackling feelings of inadequacy. As a man, that is one of the most insidious feelings we can possibly get. If I were to guess, he feels like he's failing himself, failing his family, failing you, and perhaps even failing his friends. That's an awful headspace to be in, and it sounds like he's spiraling, unable to see a way out. As another commenter mentioned, a lack of sex will magnify this issue.

To be clear, I'm not saying you **owe** him sex, or anything so awful as that. But, speaking as a man, he probably measures a good portion of his worth on whether he can please his wife, and how ""into it"" she is. It's not the healthiest thing, and ideally therapy can help him get past that, but it's a dimension worth exploring if you really want to help, and sex isn't a problem. Having fun and making him feel desired is as important as the actual sex, so even just flirting like you're in high school and giving him eyes can make a world of difference. In short, don't stop dating him.

Outside of that, I also agree with another commenter that giving him a gentle talking-to about the self-pity might be something he needs. However, I don't mean you should do that in a vacuum. First, build him up. Remind him of all he's achieved, all the good things he's done, remind him (and show him) that you're still very much his wife both in life and in the bedroom, and that you have his back. Then you tell him that he's got the strength/courage/wisdom/whatever to see shit through to the end, and that he's a badass, and the self-pity is getting him nowhere.

It's a hard line to toe, and I don't envy your position. Your husband is in a vulnerable, volatile state by the sound of it, which means that this whole thing could backfire. But, that's life. You have to take risks to get any good out of it. Good luck."	PitifulParfait	reply	na	na	na	0.9978914856910706	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"As someone that's struggled with feelings of being worthless and like I'm always failing to meet expectations, I've been in his spot quite a few times. It's easy to get tripped up on something tiny and the dominos keep falling, one after another, and you end up not being able to recall that you were in bad times like this before, but you did get through it, so there's no reason that you can't get through this time, too.

What's worked for me is taking some time to look at past me. I try to start by thinking about what I did before, when I was experiencing a hard time, that got me back on track. If he's been going up and down emotionally over the years, he's surely went from bad times to OK or good times, so what was he doing then that helped him feel better? Also, he should look at where he was in the past to see how much he has grown as a person, be it in maturity, education, work positions, health, and/or the like. It's really easy to compare oneself to others and feel like you are failing because you aren't them, but surely he's growing into a better him today than he was a year ago, 5 years ago, and 10 years ago. He may not be able to see this growth, but maybe you have? Pinpointing specific ways that he's improved in various aspects of his life could help him see that he is improving, but he was just unable to see it because he was so down on himself. He's in higher education right now, and even if he's struggling, I imagine that 4 or 5 years ago he wasn't in higher education at all, but he took the steps to challenge himself and he's been killing it so far, so fixating on one stumble isn't that big of a deal. I majored in mathematics, but failed a statistics class once, because I had personal issues and couldn't focus on my class (sounds like he's in a similar boat), and it was super embarrassing and depressing, but I just took the class the next time it was offered and passed without issue. Sometimes, failing is fine, so long as you learn from your failures. 

As a man, and it's held true with pretty much every man that I've known, I like solutions to problems instead of just wallowing in pity and not trying to fix things. Venting is fine, but eventually I feel like my venting approaches pity party levels, and that's not healthy. I don't know him, but I imagine that he'd like to fix his current issues, but he's just overwhelmed. It's hard to look at a mountain of problems and find the energy to start fixing them, but it is easier to separate that mountain down into individual piles and begin sorting through the issues. Maybe try sitting down with a sheet of paper or something and looking at current issues and trying to find small ways to start fixing them. You say that he has performance issues at work, so what are they? Is he struggling to perform basic aspects of his job? Is he unable to make it to work on time, consistently? Does he have issues with his boss or coworkers? List out a few of these issues and try to come up with ways to address them. For example, if he sucks at his job and keeps making mistakes, is it actually an issue of being undertrained and not him just being bad? I've been at jobs before where I kept screwing up and ultimately found out that it was because I had never been shown the correct process, so my work was always filled with flaws. Once I got properly trained, the mistakes disappeared over time. To solve this issue, he could talk to or send an email to his boss or a mentor and ask for training on an issue.

For me, if I was told I'm about to fail a class, I would ask the professor for a meeting to explain what's been going on personally and what I can do to get back on track to pass. It sounds like he feels his fate is inevitable, and that inevitability makes him feel hopeless.

There's two ways I would approach it: you could think of activities that are challenging but well within his capabilities and let him rehab his confidence, in the same way as someone would go to physical therapy for an injury. You could also sit him down and, from a place of love, tell him he needs to stop pitying himself.

 I’ve been having manic moods of wanting to buy things that make me sexually feel good, but I thankfully have been able to fight them off.

Yesterday I really went off the rails. Normally I am attracted to cisgender women, but for some reason I had this extreme urge to get into dating trans women. For context, I have enjoyed transgender porn in the past, but I haven’t gone out of my way to try and date a trans female until yesterday when I downloaded a dating app specifically for dating trans women. Before you ask, no, I don’t trans women should be treated less or anything like that. I’m just weirded out because this doesn’t feel like me. I don’t know if I should procede with trying to use this app or not.

"In my work as a hypnotherapist most of my clients are mature adults experiencing issues rooted in anger, anxiety, depression - or a mixture of these. Often, they are wondering if their present issues are linked to their childhood experiences. More often than not, the answer is yes. 

Research carried out since the end of the last century has led to a greater understanding of how adverse childhood experiences impact on long term wellbeing – both physical and psychological. The key findings are:

· Childhood trauma is very common: even in so-called well-to-do areas.

· There is a direct link between childhood trauma and chronic disease in adulthood.

· The more types of trauma a child experiences, the greater the risk of them of experiencing social and emotional problems as adults.

· Those who experience childhood trauma often experience more than one type of trauma.

You can calculate your own ACEs score by responding to the following questions. Give yourself 1 point for each question where you experienced that category of trauma before your eighteenth birthday. 

1. Emotional abuse: Did a parent or other adult often or very often insult, demean, belittle, humiliate, verbally assault, or threaten to physically assault You? 

2. Physical abuse: Did a parent or other adult often or very often grab, slap, push, or hit You? 

3. Sexual abuse: Did a parent, adult, or someone at least five years older than you ever touch your body in a sexual way or attempt or have oral, anal, or vaginal intercourse with You? 

4. Emotional neglect: Did You often or very often feel that no one in your family loved you or thought you were important; or your family did not look out for each other, feel close to each other, and support each other? 

5. Physical neglect: Did You often not have enough to eat, had to wear dirty clothes, had no one to attend to your medical and dental needs, or had no one to protect you? 

6. Loss of parent: Were your parents separated or divorced, or did you lose a parent for any reason? 

7. Domestic violence: Did You often or very often witness or hear violence between your parents or other adults where someone was being grabbed, shoved, slapped, hit, kicked, had something thrown a them, sexually attacked, or threatened with a weapon? 

8. Family member with addiction: Did You live with anyone who was a problem drinker or alcoholic, who used illicit drugs, or who was addicted to any other substances? 

9. Family member with depression/mental illness: Did you live with anyone who was depressed or mentally ill, attempted or committed self-harm and/or suicide, or hospitalized for mental illness? 

10. Family member incarcerated: Did you live with anyone who went to prison? 

ACES Score (0-10) = 

As ACE scores increase, so does the risk of disease, social and emotional problems. With an ACE score of four or more, things start getting serious. While studies in different locations return slightly different results, the figures suggest around 11% of the population have experienced four or more adverse childhood experiences.  

Fortunately, brains and lives are somewhat plastic. Resilience research shows that the appropriate integration of resilience factors — such as asking for help, developing trusting relationships, forming a positive attitude, listening to feelings — can help people improve their lives. Research in to post traumatic growth has identified five broad areas of growth:

· greater appreciation of life, 

· closer relationships with others, 

· increased personal strength, 

· new possibilities in life, and 

· spiritual “development

Which correlate very closely with the dimensions of wellbeing psychology:

· Positive emotions

· Positive engagement

· Positive relationships

· Positive meaning

· Positive accomplishments

· Positive health"	EERMA	post	43.26530543658126	male	White	0.004216364584863186	na	na	na	4	malementalhealth

"23M. I know I’m still very young. Quick background about me might help. I’ve had 2 serious relationships. Both in high school. Last relationship ended at 18. College was shit. My mom always said when I was younger that “college is the best years of your life”. Nope. Transferred to a local school near home when Covid hit, finished off my last 2 years living at home and commuting. I’m an introvert. I have friends from HS that didn’t mature and I don’t really enjoy being around them anymore. I don’t drink or go out on weekends. Spend 95% of my time with my parents. I love to workout, I’m easy going, funny, fairly attractive (trying not to sound arrogant). However, I have a chronic illness that is painful (and kinda gross) that impacts much of my life. I also lack a little confidence.

Anyway, I’ve been very lonely and keep feeling like I’ll never find a girl and get married etc. I feel tons of pressure to find love and start a family because my parents want that. They want to see me with kids, happy, and loved before they die. They aren’t old, but I almost feel as if it’s my duty to make this happen. And I am worried I won’t be able to. She’s always looking to set me up. I can tell she wants me to have a gf. I feel so much pressure.

Note: I kinda have a deal with myself that if I don’t have kids at a certain age, I will adopt and be a single dad because I feel like my mom would want to see me raise kids."	mv2500	post	26.671232302515833	male	White	0.9964547157287598	na	na	na	3	malementalhealth

As such just trying to achieve these things may not be possible (can anyone really say for sure they will find a long term partner, get married, have kids?) and it would be great if your mom understood how things are different these days.  My parents went to a bar and met each other on a random disco night lol. Things don't exactly work like 1978 anymore.  Neither one of them hopped out of there then in the next half hour started swiping in Tinder, found a different dude, and then texting every friend how it went so they could obtain self validation points. If she can't well that's too bad because it's your life not hers.  Don't force something because of other people.  Figure out what works for you.  It's a much healthier thing to do.

"Stop engaging with people who think like that. If all you want to do is find a girlfriend, there’s no point in hanging out with guys who want you to think that ultra masculine social media flexing bullshit is *real* when in reality it’s entirely for show. Not to mention, are you actually interested in spending time with someone, man or woman, who listens to and believes the Andrew Tate’s of the world?

99% of people you’ll meet won’t care about how masculine you look. Anyone who spends enough time with you will be able to tell if you’re not being yourself, so why bother constantly trying to be someone you’re not? Improving yourself every day is NOT about trying to completely change who you are. Its about finding the best version of yourself and learning how to maintain that, and stay balanced. If you’re ending every day immensely stressed and exhausted, you’ll struggle to act on the improvement you made the day before. 

Take this from someone who generally doesn’t give a fuck about what others think of me, but I don’t bother letting anything on social media take up any serious space in my mind. The foundation of your beliefs should be ones you can passionately defend and come from an inner part of your mind. What do you gain by furnishing your beliefs with the thoughts of others? Especially those of narcissistic and mindless convictions like “influencers” and talentless celebrities.

"You're 20 so yeah I can definitely see how it seems like that for men of your age. In a sense, you'll find many other fellow men around your age talking like that and I know when I was at that age myself my friends acted that way when it came to how they treated women when it came to dating them casually or seriously. Ultimately, that mindset turned out pretty gnarly for many friends I knew who engaged in that type of behavior since most of them are still not in a stable relationship while I managed to have at least two that lasted for a good while. Some of them are almost 30 and they still talk about women like they did in their early 20s (and it's quite cringy and sad too because they really are unaware of how ridiculous they sound too).

I admit that I did get to the whole sex and dating scene a bit later in my life as I did not lose my v card until I was in my mid-20s. Still...that did not stop me from building up the diverse pool/count of women I would end up dating until ending up in the steady relationship I am in now as of a couple of years ago (almost three years in fact). I definitely hate to sound cliche in trying to 'remind' or 'tell' you that it's not all about being successful in 'picking up women' as if it is some sort of conquest as eventually the repeated rejection and failure can weigh on a man too. I know from firsthand experience that even when I followed advice to ""work on myself"" or ""focus on myself"" I still found myself getting ghosted a lot with little to no matches on dating apps. Had to ultimately adjust my approaches little by little to the point I would learn to use multiple dating apps (although I had to choose specific ones that worked better for me and that took trial n error) along with making little changes to my style while also doing my best to take every little bit of my dating one moment at a time rather than putting the pressure on myself to ""make it work this time"".

Anyway I don't expect for your experience in courting women to go the exact same as the way I did but I hope that by sharing some of my experiences you can look at your struggle in a different light where it does not have to be so outwardly bitter towards others (although I find it understandable for men to become like that when they experience repeated failures or rejections in life). Ultimately, that mindset can really sabotage your own efforts to find a girl who will like you for you as you will only sell yourself short by making yourself look like some angry bitter guy that is no fun to be around. It's a lot easier said than done to just ""stop that"" of course but I'd say at the very least just do your best to be aware of it. I think as long as you're aware of where you can do better then you will be good in your efforts to0 find someone like that. Otherwise, only other thing I can say is remember to take a break when you find yourself going too deep into bitterness when you think about your own dating situation and how it has been going with those women you are trying to date."

I’m not saying you’re wrong because you’re not but also there are people who don’t see it that way and you should become one of them.

So within a narrow subset of people whom I found extra attractive I was rejected and berated and left feeling defeated and then I opened my mind up to more available/adequate-for-me people and eventually met girls I clicked with and then I saw the light and I never looked back.

I'm now also volunteering weekly for an after school program designed to promote an interest in learning at a school where there's a lot of underprivileged students. I'm also going to the gym regularly.


I still have a lot to improve though. I'd like to lose at least 50 pounds. I'd like to start weightlifting at home as well so I can lift 3 or 4 times per week instead of just 1 or 2 times per week. I'd like to learn to be more confident, especially with women. And I might like to go back and finish college some day."

"At this point I’ll never what my life would have been like had I not had a very serious pelvic fracture at age 20 when I was prime shape and health.

I’ve struggled with self esteem ever since, and the issues might have cone anyways but I can only speculate the issues can only be worse if I can’t get my penis up.

The first few years after the fracture it was truly impossible for me to get it up and I would even masturbate to a limb penis. I could cum so it was just the erection that was missing, the rest of the “plumbing” was working fine. Still very depressing for a man at that age.

It gradually got better, at times much better (in my 20s) but always had the risk of losing it in a sec, it was generally unreliable especially if I want to go for foreplay and then sex. It always felt like if I was able to get it up I had to have sex before it went limb again which is not the best for prepping your partner.

Now with age problems are bigger but still a dose of Tadalafil would make me feel like a man again.

I have been very sad about all this, I can only think of how many times my insecurities or my apparent lack of interest in foreplay (for fear of losing the erection) might have contributed to me never having a committed relationship. But when I think of the years I’ve gone by with a limb penis, most of the times not even feeling anything in my crotch area, I can only be sorry for myself.

For the last few months I have been taking Tadalafil, just to feel like a man even though I have nobody to sleep with and might not have for a long time."	tellmemoremore	post	25.500493256412067	male	White	0.9950401186943054	na	na	na	3	malementalhealth
Honestly idk how you feel, all i can offer advice you may have done already. Go see a pelvic floor therapist, they are not just for woman look for a really good one and they can treat you. Keep taking the tadalafil its just a pill and if it makes you feel better fuck it. Start eating right and hitting the gym consistently, there are many programs to follow i personally like a guy named jpgcoaching. There is a lot of things we cant control and accepting that is kinda freeing, but there is a lot we can control and that is even better. Check your hormone leves as well, your T might be down and you could benefit a lot from T-therapy. The way i see it some things you might have to so the rest of your life but i always think i brush my teeth twice a day and it helps so why stop?

Hello, it's been almost 1year since I barely go outdoors and I can't managr to find out the reason why. I got chronic depression&insomnia, severe BPD, generalised anxiety and paranoid personality disorder. A few months ago I started going outside even less than before, I can actually admit that I isolate myself hardcore, not even talking to people. I don't enter social media, only when i'm high on something. Strongest symptome of BPD is impulsivity, as I do drugs, play compulsive slots and engage in dangerous activities & self harm. Can anyone tell me some opinions of why am I like that. Besides traumas, do you think it's because of my borderline or because of the traumas themselves? I trust no one and find it hard to talk to people. I take daily medication for 5years now. The depression always kicks in, no matter what. I am addicted to drugs and the happiest moments are mostly on them, only a few were while being sober. I can't afford a therapist. I am so fucking sad most of the time, could even get out of bed and do something but sleep my life away...Help?

wish I could help but i'll paint my point of view which may not really be beneficial in anyway but if it can even help for you to make a conclusion itll be worth, I have a best friend who hasn't been able to go outside because of some PTSD issues and anxiety issues, he was never diagnosed so I wouldn't know because he couldn't go outside to a doctor to do so, I don't know what you go through when you do go outside wether it just becomes anxiety and stress which escalates the more you're outside but being stuck inside sounds horrible and can't imagine what you're going through, I personally think you should go at your own pace and make it an everyday mission to push yourself further and further outside. If you become 1% better at it everyday thats alot better than 0%, if I could get more details on what you go through wether its here or over dms I could try and be helpful to you.

"I'm a few months shy of 30. Have had a couple hookups, but never a girlfriend. I've recently made some posts on some other subs where I say, essentially, that self-improvement will not help you find a partner, and people should stop telling lonely people to ""work on themselves"". I see how that can come off as defeatist and combative, but I'm struggling to see how it's *wrong*. The facts are thus: 

-Again: almost 30, never had a girlfriend though a few hookups. 

-**I have high-functioning autism**, but can blend in fairly well aside from hand flapping.

-One hookup I met at a bar, we went back to my place. Another I met at a different bar, went for a long walk before going back to my place, ultimately didn't escalate beyond talking, kissing, and cuddling.

-Have a first date once in a while. Usually just not much of a connection, but even when I do feel a connection, doesn't lead to second date. 

-Many, many other instances of getting a number at bar, or from dating app, and never making it to an actual date. 

-Have a job making above average money, and live alone.

-Multiple hobbies: I do standup comedy, and do some historical research work I've gotten public recognition for. I was in a running club for about a year. Getting back into writing. Go out to just drink and chill a couple times a week.

-Been working with a personal trainer for about a year, bodyfat likely around ~18%

-Social life is lacking *a little* right now, just in terms of not having people I regularly make plans with. But in some ways that just feels like part of adulthood. I still have close friends I talk to regularly, and acquaintances I regularly see while out on the town.

-I have talked to many friends, including female friends, about my dating woes over the past decade or so. Most of these conversations just boil down to ""Autism is hard"" and ""You'll meet someone eventually."" 

So, I mean, ""Working on yourself is useless in dating"" seems like a pretty valid conclusion from where I come from. How should I rephrase it? ""Self-improvement doesn't help ME with dating,  but it might help a neurotypical!"" Or ""I might finally meet someone when I'm 40, good thing I worked on myself for so long!""

Of course I have flaws. Autism means that I'll always come off a little odd. I could cut back on drinking a bit more. The fact that I'm this invested in internet arguments is probably a character flaw. But most of these seem pretty minor in the grand scheme of things, and I have trouble believing that if I just tweak these *last few things*, dating will suddenly become easier.

TLDR: Everyone has flaws, and most people have (or have had) partners. I feel like I've done much more to improve my deficits than most people and have never had a partner, so ""Working on yourself is not useful in dating"" feels reasonable from my POV."

Coming from someone who doesn't expect to date again for a while, if ever (and I've been single for the last ten years), don't just work on yourself, though that is good advice. Work on your friendships, both male and female.  Cultivate friendships where you can be honest, open, and vulnerable with each other.  I think men tend to make their romantic partner their only emotional outlet, and that's not healthy.  I don't know much about autism, but from what I understand it (in part) inhibits how you perceive and express emotions, but it doesn't mean you don't have them.  Also, find ways to express your emotions in healthy ways.  [Emotional intelligence is a key skill](https://old.reddit.com/r/NerdChapel/comments/btj31i/some_thoughts_on_developing_emotional_intelligence/) for any mature adult, and while that may look different for you than neurotypicals, that doesn't mean you don't still need it.

"You're not being autistic enough is my guess.

In other words, you're probably doing that socially accepted thing where you dance around the subject and ask women if they'd like to go out with you sometime, or talk up some even and invite them to it, or try to make small talk, etcetera.

Fuck that noise. Next girl you meet that's attractive, just say ""I want a girlfriend, eventually a wife and kids. I have a good job and a solid support network. Are you interested, or know someone who is?""

Just drop that raw. No lube. And keep doing it until you find someone who says yes that meets your standards.

As long as you have the basics covered, rent and gas money etc., and you can generally access new prospective women - I'm assuming through your comedy hobby - most of the personality issues you have you can work around. In fact you should be more wary of *her* mental issues than your own, IME.

This isn't just letting your autism flag fly high, though, it's a valid strategy. Called 'managing expectations.' Set the tone for what a person should expect from the outset, what the topic of conversation is, what the thought on the tip of their brain will be. It's written in a bunch of project management coursebooks and shit like that, things every account manager or entrepreneur should know. But it's just as important in your personal life.

That said, it's remarkably difficult to get the hang of this if you're not used to doing it. Especially if, as a 'high functioning', you've barricaded your speech and behavior with filters out of self-protection to the point where dismantling some of that shit is painful. Trust me bro, I know the feeling. But that's what you need to do: manage expectations to get better results.

All of that said, it's not just you either. Dating culture and the wider toxic attitude towards men in general makes it so relationships are so fraught with risk that it's often a terrible idea to even try. Like, it is legitimately unsound as a time investment; the deck is too stacked against men if things go wrong. I would not be surprised if our birth rate falls off a cliff (even harder than it already has) because of how bad it is out there for men. The bias is real.

But I suppose you need to have some success in establishing relationships before you get to the point of realizing how much you should fear them, so don't worry about that part yet. Just worry about the old account manager chestnut 'manage expectations'. Cheers, hope this helps."	MiddlePatuxent	reply	na	na	na	0.005024231504648924	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"Hi, I'm 21 and my issue is as the title said. Since I was a kid I've had issues controlling my temper. I can't pinpoint where it all started but I've been bullied and used in school so I guess I developed it on my own as a means to fight back. It didn't work but it was better than doing nothing.

I left it alone and thought it would get better overtime but all I actually did was bottle it up, pretending nothing gets to me, then it bursts out in very ugly ways and I end up throwing stuff, breaking stuff and self-harm (punching the wall or hard objects).

I considered therapy and counseling, but I can't afford one and our family insurance doesn't cover it. I can use my University's counseling service, but then I saw that they put you on a 4 month waiting list because too many people need it, so it can't relied on regularly. 

So I'm stuck. It's a huge problem I really want to solve but I barely have any options to do so. I want this fixed because I don't want it to lead me to hurt  the few people who give a shit about me, or drive them away.

"So let me say, I came from a very abusive home, mentally and physically. I used to literally get interrogated for about my suspected sexuality by my parents because I “liked to write”, “drank tea”, and “didn’t cut grass or do other manly things. My mother always dated jailbirds who did not know how to handle me except through violence. Oh you were caught talking to a girl explicitly, fist fight me, type of guys. I’m not even joking I got stripped naked and beat for being physically active in 9th grade. 

Needless to say I went a long period of time where I thought everything about myself was wrong. I used to literally call my best friend crying my eyes out, saying how I was a genetic failure and not tough enough to exist. I used to feel my opinion did not matter. 

Fast forward, I’m 23 and I have no backbone. I let people talk & walk all over me. And I hate it. People even tell me I come off like a door mat. But whenever I confront someone, it’s poor timing. I can’t “read the room.” I don’t know how to say no. And tbh I’ve always been socially akward. But I consider myself very good at reading intentions. I can tell someone is being fake or dislikes me..and I’ll still go out of my way for em.

"For some context I'm 27. My mum and me used to have a really good relationship when I was a kid and growing up into my late teens. She was kind and caring, I loved her to bits and didn't get along with my dad all that well. Somewhere between my early 20's and now something changed big time. Now it's the opposite way round. 


Shes in a job position where she holds a lot of authority which is great, she's the main breadwinner which again good for her. Trouble is she doesn't know how to switch out of work mode and back into family mode.so almost every single day, if its been a shit day she'll either take it out on me or my dad or both. Whichever unlucky soul she runs into first become an emotional punching bag for her to take her day out on. Me and my dad are just so tired of it.

However, my older sister gets treated so much better than us. It's not her fault but my mum acts like the sun shines out of my sisters arse. Recently sister gave birth to my little nephew and don't get me wrong I love the kid to death. Trouble is, me and my dad have kinda just been tossed aside like we don't mean a damn thing anymore which obviously stings and doesn't help our relationship one bit. It honestly does feel like she loves me and my dad far less if at all and as a result I won't lie as terrible as it is, I caught myself feeling a bit of animosity towards a baby.

Little things that she does to constantly undermine and disrespect me have been happening a lot too. For example a couple extended family members came down for the day to visit. I remembered a funny story that my mum was there for when it happened, I didn't even get halfway through the story and she just casually hijacked it. I tried picking it back up but she just kept shutting me down, I even turned to my sister and out loud asked ""am I telling this story or is she?"" But got no acknowledgement. Its just plain rude to do this. 

Another of her favourites is to tell me ""not to be argumentative"" any time i even remotely disagree with something or even if I breathe in the wrong way I'll get that response. It infuriates me to the point I do actually end up getting argumentative. The final straw was yesterday. Our dog turns out is slightly over weight, admittedly we do give her too many treats so my dad got us all together and we all agreed to not give her any, just her din er which was fine. Last night I noticed the dog had snuffed the rest of her dinner so in an effort to help her along I put some of her chicken and kibble in my hand and she came over and ate some. Mum looked at me and lost her mind, ""YOU BETTER NOT BE GIVING HER TREATS! WHAT DID WE  TELL YOU????""
I tell her I didnt, I'm giving her her dinner. She keeps repeating herself and even when I try showing her that it's chicken she shuts me down with her favourite phrase. I admit this was a childish response and I'm not proud of it but I just had enough at this stage. I launched the food into the living room and told her ""WELL WHY DON'T YOU LOOK AFTER THE DOG IF YOU'RE SUCH A FUCKING EXPERT"" I ended up punching my bedroom door which i never do and I'm not proud of that. 

It all just boiled over, this little interaction just sent me over the edge. I'm sitting there feeling absolutely worthless and un cared for by my mother, in silently crying. I get a knock on the door and I'm about to tell her to go away, but surprisingly, it's my dad who is visibly concerned. I tell him she doesn't give a shit about me and its only gotten worse and more obvious since my nephew was born which is unfair, its not the kids faul but I was losing my mind with how upset I was at the time. I asked for his help, how nothing gonna change if he won't back me up a little. I awake up this morning and my dad tried fighting my case, they got in a huge argument and she apparently told him and I quote ""I WISH I COULD JUST FUCKING GET RID OF YOU TWO"" To which my dad told her ""Well why don't you fuck off then if you hate us so much?"" 

I feel like the family is going down the pan, and it's my fault. Maybe I just need to leave, im so fucking tired of this. Did I over react here?"	throwaway159101	post	19.946106458883925	female	White	0.9994200468063354	na	na	na	3	malementalhealth

Things like that happen. It builds up after a while. Today at school we had a antiracism presentation and they had a analogy about small racist jokes that you might not acknowledge. They said each joke is a brick that goes in a back pack and eventually the back pack falls (breaking point). Somebody was eventually gonna scream at your mother. Its not your fault.

"> Did I over react here?

You yourself agree you wished you'd have expressed your anger differently, so that's a lesson to keep and something to work on. Now, it's very understandable that you are reacting strongly, as *you're losing your connection to one of your parents!* This is huge, even if you're an adult! Especially if you have fond memories of her, the superposition of what she means for you and the current mother is going to be extremely painful. Though I wonder, have you expressed how much she means to you, and how painful this situation is? It's as if the logic of work has overtaken everything else in her life, it could be a last ditch attempt to make her realize what's she losing.

Now, this is reminding me of something in occupational psychology too: Work to Family interactions. This can be caused by workaholism and burn out, or cause them. Over-investing oneself in work can be a way to avoid issues in the family. Also, becoming a breadwinner can lead to resentment, and it's not just something that happens in heterosexual relationships. I can't help but wonder too if she's not over-extending the logic of ""I have to fight against men at work"" to the family. She may also hold some sexist views about men not experiencing some emotions. The concept of [neoliberal feminism](https://stateofnatureblog.com/catherine-rottenberg-neoliberal-feminism/) could be useful here too, as neolib feminism holds the promise of equality through the logic of capitalism, and it may push people to react to pre-existing issues by relying on ruthless individualism, rather than working towards a post-patriarchal society of care and mutual aid.

> so almost every single day, if its been a shit day she'll either take it out on me or my dad or both. Whichever unlucky soul she runs into first become an emotional punching bag for her to take her day out on. Me and my dad are just so tired of it.

This can qualify as emotional abuse.

There might be a lot of background you're unaware of here. Some long standing family issues, and what you see is but a manifestation of that that's barely related to you. It's easy to say I know, but ideally some familial therapy would be in order."	throwaway159101	reply	na	na	na	0.9994200468063354	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"This has the potential to get pretty convoluted, so I won't go into too much detail, but I've felt like my mental health has deteriorated pretty badly in the last week or so.

I'm 36 and have dealt with depression for decades. I've been pretty stable in recent years, but I've had a hard time prioritizing my mental health even when I need to be. It's been 5 years since I've had a good therapist that last more than a few months. I have no friends. I had *some* folks online that I had built up friendships with, but we've all mostly gone our separate ways in recent months. 

I'm very distant from my family and (unfortunately) learned years ago that I was better off keeping my personal struggles to myself. My wife and I have had some issues over the last couple years. I've tried to open up to her about where my mind has been at in recent weeks, only to have every conversation end with her clearly not comprehending what I was trying to say.

Maybe I'm the problem. Maybe I just do a terrible job of explaining how I feel, but regardless, it's left me feeling like I have no one to talk to. 

It's gotten to the point where simply reading stuff on the internet that I disagree with will just trigger the downward spiral all over again. I know it doesn't matter, people can have differring opinions, it just always leaves me thinking ""You see? No one cares what you think.""

Like everyone else, it's a struggle to maintain good habits, but this past week I haven't really tried. A consistent sleep schedule? Structure in my day? Self-care? Yeah, they might all help my mental health, but I see no reason why I should be prioritizing that. It doesn't matter to anyone else, and frankly it doesn't matter to me."

"Hey folks. This has been on my chest recently and I'd like to vent. Not necessarily looking for advice, but definitely want to share and find people who feel the same.

So, I'm 34, in good health, doing reasonably well in life, but I still feel like I'm making some wrong choices that make it difficult to find a long term partner.

I've had a girlfriend for a long time (10+ years), but we got together quite young, just around when we were 18, and grew apart over time. It was a very painful breakup, but I think it I found a way to came out of the initial depression as a better person. I started to live for my hobbies, created a nice living environment for myself, had well paid jobs with good work/life balance.

Then I had another girlfriend for a bit over a year, but I think I rushed into that relationship, we both thought that I needed more time focusing on myself. That relationship was really good, but somehow I still felt that I didn't really want it, I wasn't invested in it, so we broke up. Even the breakup went quite smoothly, which is weird, but I'm happy that it did. I think it kind of proves that I've matured in the way I handle my relationships.

But things have started to go a bit downhill after that. I've had quite a few one nighters - not necessarily a bad thing (yeah I know, a lot of people think it's actually awesome...), but at one point I had to stop because yeah sure, casual sex sounds fun, but I wanted real connection.

There was the thought of getting together with my last girlfriend. I think we left that option open, because we both felt that we could have a really good thing if I was ready for it.

Of course, there is a but. I've been planning to go abroad for several years, which I almost did in 2020, but then I couldn't because of border closures. Last year, just about after when I stopped seeking those one nighters, I received an email that the borders are reopening and my visa will be re-issued. That meant that I had to make a decision and I decided to go. I know I would have never forgiven myself if I didn't, after having planned it for so long.

I've been here now for almost half a year. At the beginning, I really enjoyed the new environment, new friendships, the freedom of doing temp jobs and travels.

Then I met a girl... She hit the right buttons from the very beginning, we clicked quite well. After knowing each other just for a few days, we went on a holiday, just the two of us and it was really refreshing.

Unfortunately though, I had my next job lined up quite far away from where we met and where she worked. I didn't want to throw my plans away (this seems to be a pattern...) and we've basically only just met, so I left and she stayed.

We're still in contact though and she's planning to come where I am right now, within a couple of months, which I'm really looking forward to. But, of course, there's a few problems again.

One being that we both are from entirely different parts of the world and it's not clear for any of us if we'd like to stay here, go home, or go somewhere else. What makes this even more difficult is that my visa will run out in less than 6 months after we meet again. If I was to stay, I'll need to start working on getting a work visa, which would mean that the freedom of temp jobs and travels would be over for me, and that would make it difficult for us to spend time together again...

Also, she has commitment issues. I don't really know a lot about it, but it makes it difficult for her to share her feelings / thoughts because she's afraid of getting hurt. In practice, this means that she shares almost nothing of what she thinks of us and what we had. She's giving very subtle signs that it might have been something more than a fling and there might be a way for her to open up and give in to her feelings, but looks like this is something that will take a long time. The best I can do for now, for the sake of my mental health and also in order to not scare her away, is to not initiate contact, unless she does. We talked about it, so it's not games (also, it was my idea, not hers).

Obviously, I could let this whole thing go, which would probably be the wise decision. But it just feels like no matter which decision I make, I'll end up miserable. Either because of investing in a relationship that has so many obstacles, or because of letting something go that could be great thing.

And on a side note, I'm missing my friends and easy life back home. But that doesn't really matter in terms of ending up being alone in life. Also, I have very little social life right now because of my job, which doesn't help with the loneliness.

I'm sure things will get better, they always do. But right now it feels like I'm a prisoner of my choices. I want to break free and not give a damn, just accept whatever comes, but currently I just feel like shit..."	cogitodubitoamo	post	21.028217487294903	male	White	0.001584659330546856	na	na	na	2	malementalhealth
"The reason I am the person I am today is because I have a friend who has lived an interesting and colorful life because he would always try different things. He has a nice place and is in a pretty good place in life. He tried to be an astrophysicist, he was a developer for Sim City 2000 and had a lot of stories about all of the drugs being consumed in those offices, and he worked as an aid at an art college for a while, worked as a bartender, and bunch of other things I can't remember.

Even if you fail, you gain experience and a story to tell about your life. 

Imagine yourself at 90 years old on your deathbed, remiscing life where you always take reserved steps, never took risks. Would that be a life you'd be happy with?

Imagine a life where you tried crazy and dumb shit, usually failing. Audition for an acting role, write a book, paint a series of pictures and try to pass yourself off as some deep artist to see if you can get a gallery to host you just to fuck with people. Start a band or just become a noise musician.

Be a little crazy, let yourself be stupid and fail at things. Just don't put yourself at risk of death lol"	cogitodubitoamo	reply	na	na	na	0.001584659330546856	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

" So I was having a conversation with some younger guys about girls. One of the guys was all sad that this girl wasn't into him after he was the shoulder to cry on,he did things for her, yet was rejected. And of course he was all sad over it.

&#x200B;

  Now I'm not going to talk about why, I am going to talk about how he was handling it wrong. 

&#x200B;

 The thing is that most guys who handle rejection wrong absolutely kill their ability to speak to potential partners due a lack of confidence due to past failures. Its emasculating and makes you feel weak. There's many reasons why you can be told no, but how you handle it is even more important.

&#x200B;

 The issue is this, she has every right to say no, It is not ordained by god that she accept you. It may feel unfair if you do allot and she still picks someone else but that is entirely her decision. 

&#x200B;

 It is also your decision whether or not to give a shit about it. It's her choice, no means no. you can feel like a weakling for being told no or you can handle it the right way by respecting her decision and walking away.

&#x200B;

 Women are plentiful. The girl who rejected you may have a few good things about her, but so does the girl up the street at the gas station, so does the counter girl at the fast food place you frequent, so does the nerdy girl at the library and the barista at your favorite coffee place.

&#x200B;

 So don't get hung up on the girl saying no. There's plenty to go around. Work on you, For the work is always yours.

&#x200B;

also made a youtube vid on the matter.

"At this rate in my life, I genuinely don’t see myself living past 30. I’ve ruined my mind, body and soul so much that I don’t see myself as a real person anymore. I have nothing at all to show for my life. I’m neurodivergent with no friends, no partners, no talents, no accomplishments, no experiences, no stories, no interesting hobbies, no one who cares about me that isn’t immediate family, nothing that would hold s person’s attention for more than 10 seconds without them walking away in disgust. I’ve made no strives towards college nor do I have any sort of vision for a career that isn’t spending the rest of my days at my current job. I feel so isolated and disconnected from my coworkers that I have worked there for 3 years now and have not held a single meaningful conversation with anyone there. I have nothing interesting or useful to say, I’m so awkward and unsociable that I genuinely cannot talk or connect with anyone no matter how hard I try even if they are friendly towards me. Just now I had an interaction with a coworker that was so awkward and poorly handled that I’m currently sitting in the bathtub crying my eyes out. Nobody here really cares or thinks about me, I’m just a glorified robot who’s only there to do work and help others. Nobody would notice or care if I left my job, and my position would be totally replaced by someone else within the month. I don’t feel human at all, I can’t if I feel so detached and disconnected from my fellow people. I feel subhuman

I fear that on my 30th birthday I’ll have so little to show for my life compared to everyone else around me and zero hope for my life getting any better that I won’t be able to handle it anymore and I will take my life. I could take that option early but I can’t bring myself to.

Once I started doing it what I wanted and fuck everyone who didn’t agree with it, I was happier. Being social is a life skill that you can learn, like other skills. Also realizing that nobody cares can be freeing in some way. It’s a fact of adulthood, people are absorbed in their own lives. That means you should be able to do what you want without others getting too upset.

"Hi there,

I am sorry to hear that you have had such a rough time in life. You must feel so hopeless and overwhelmed. When you are stuck in a major run it can be hard seeing living past today. Have you ever gone to see a counselor? One thing that can really help I'd to learn to appreciate the things you have to offer society. Once you recognize what you have to offer and appreciate the talents you have then it becomes easier. It is hard to relate to others when you don't find value in yourself. Therapy can help with appreciating yourself. People are turned off by low self esteem and working on that is a good building block. There is definitely a path forward and things can get better. 

I have been in similar situation. I was in special ed for several years, spent almost 1 years in a psych ward for self harm, thought I was a throwaway. It lead to a vicious cycle. I had no friends, no wife, no job, nothing. I kept thinking about taking my own life as well. I finally found a good counselor who was able to help me out. It took awhile but it worked. If you would like to chat further please message me. You are in my thoughts and prayers."		reply	na	na	na	0.9993300437927246	strong	strong	strong	na	malementalhealth

I have lost about 50% of my hair and seeing guys my age have perfect hairlines, thick hair etc while I have to have the Lloyd Christmas haircut to just conceal my hairloss is so discouraging. Before it began I had very thick hair and a unique colour so I would be complimented for my hair every few days, not any more, of course. It makes me too insecure to do anything, why would I even attempt to date when I'll feel like shit due to my hair?

14 is rough. I started balding at 19 or 20 and I had to shave my head at 27. I should have done it way earlier, but I just couldn’t accept what was happening. In one case a girl I went out with left as soon as she noticed it (she was very short, so it took her a while). Hang in there, man. We’re lucky to be living in a time where bald is an accepted mainstream look. I don’t feel pressure to wear a wig to work or anything lol. Not too long ago, that was how we had to live.

I started balding in in my teens as well, so generally kept my hair short and had like a skin fade haircut to hide it.


Even with my baldingness I still managed to go out on dates and had a girlfriend when I was at college. I’m basically completely bald now and keep my hair completely shaved and have managed somehow to go on dates and stuff so it’s not game over yet.


So there is still hope even if you do go fully bald, I think it affects 1/3 men so there must be tonnes of bald guys who are happy and okay in life, so stay optimistic - it isn’t the end of the world, you can make peace with it and there’ll still be people in the world who could like you and appreciate you no matter how much hair you have."

"Please don’t take your life for something like this a lot of women like bald guys we really do. I would date em but never get asked out by any bald guys and I believe you just haven’t met your person yet. Self love and confidence is something everyone can work on even me signed up a therapist the other day. Forgive me as I rant. I deeply feel I’m going to shave my head again as a girl being hairless on my scalp is the best thing in the world. Taking a shower with no hair is the best thing in the damn world. Being a girl and having to shampoo your hair not scalp, condition, then wash it all out of your hair completely, scrub your scalp so no dandruff really well takes so much of my freaking day I literally do all of this once a week or as little as possible. I moisturize every other day, started oiling scalp every two days all of this with thin hair sure but when you have thick bushy hair it’s not fun. I am Merida incarnate from Brave. The beast on my head knows no boundaries other than more moisture needed and just cause you give her the best stuff doesn’t mean the hunger disappears she just gets greedier which is fine if my income allows but many times the items are something I stare at and walk past and pray I will remember before my paycheck runs out. Then my recent issue I have to change the water mechanism on my shower to filter out the calcium in my hair from NYC pipes is fucking nightmare poisoning the bonsai on my head and not to mention possibly my health. Life is full of luxuries you just have to find yours with being bald my roommates used hims for his hair. Sometimes I wish I could rip it out and I sometimes wish it doesn’t mean as much to men as we women all know it does. Men always want someone with glossy smooth princess hair and when it comes to black women it’s always an issue or why don’t you straighten it. Especially as a natural means no heat. No heat for the healthiest hair possible men don’t understand if we took as much care, true unfiltered care to take care of our hair like our children and you guys sometimes barely grasp that unless your a single dad or some how inherited your relatives children all to be done without no comments/criticisms on straightening, no rushing comments on how long is it going to take such when will you be done in the bathroom, why is their hair all over, and no judgement it would take three hours a fucking day. Every single day. So when you add 3x7x52 If we could have that time it would be spectacular but that’s not reality. We have to work, take care of relative children should they need it and if we care enough to delegate care some women don’t like kids and are complete assholes to them. 
The stress that we get from these questions if you were in my position would kill you as my hair is a beautiful bonsai I have taken cared of since… hold on the last ten years but lord knows I am always caught between shave it off or just keep her you have worked so hard. I’m always team shave it all off but my barber closed with Covid and he understood the emotional toll after you give your heart to one barber it’s not the same to go to some random."

"I know a couple bald guys who are doing juuuust fine. 

One of them just started shaving his head and rocks that look.

I've seen other guys tattoo their scalps and I think that looks badass too. The key to looking good without hair is merely accepting that you lost the genetic lottery in that one aspect of yourself.

Want to know what interferes with your life more than baldness ever will? Insecurities. Feeling bad and sorry for yourself over what you don't have. Instead, you should be leaning harder into your best qualities.

I am covered with moles. Sometimes, women who show interest in me ghost me after my shirt comes off. I have been rejected because my entire body has discolored bumps all over it. It's nothing I can control, there are no treatments other than having each individual one surgically removed (and pray they dont grow back like some have already done), and people assume I have cancer all the fucking time... but I do my best to practice self-acceptance every day because it's the only way I can make it through each day without thinking about how awful my skin is.

There are people who are going to reject you for superficial reasons. That's a reflection of *their* character, not yours. You can't hate yourself into having hair just like I can't hate my moles off of my skin. Love yourself, accept that your body will always continue to change, adapt to the changes you experience."

"what is life about?

Right now I feel like hiding an inevitable atrocity behind a curtain. my mind and body knows I'm actively lying to them and even though they're acting accordingly for now, they ain't buying my shit.

life is utterly pointless and I know it. I feel like we all know it, but some are better at lying to themselves than others. When I was young, one of my biggest questions was how everyone wasn't just either suiciding or planning to do it.

From my teenage years til now I've blamed it on my lack of a loving life. What if I, if I ever manage to get someone, feel that, looking in their eyes and touching their face with my hands, the life of two isn't what I was searching for? At least that's a safe last route to grab onto, since I don't see it happening ever.

I really don't see myself completing my whole time here, I'm ending it sooner or later out of either desperation or just a rational conclusion.

Deep down I know I don't like anything, and that's something no amount of optimism or positive outlook can save me from. I don't have nothing fulfilling to make me fulfilled. Life's really something that doesn't fit me. Have you ever been to museums as a kid, and looking around you feel like you just don't care about none of that even though you should because the teachers are telling you to and the other kids are having the time of their lives? That's the feeling I carry for everything. Even the museums are still like that to now my adult self, even though they're on my list of ""things that I tell myself and others that I enjoy"".

Sometimes it takes certain situations to give us the motivation we need, but my best advice would be to try and work on discipline, so you don’t need to rely on motivation. 

Ways you can improve that aspect of your life is to do things even if they are scary, or if you aren’t feeling up for it. You train yourself to push through these times so when the need arises you know you have the strength to do what needs to be done.

Just practice accelerating a little bit, getting a feel for the breaks, and turning. Go as many times as you need. Eventually, your fear goes away with small exposure. That’s how I began so I wasn’t completely clueless when I decided to get driving instruction. If that’s too much you could even sit in the driver’s seat, start the engine, and call it quits. That’s still progress! In regards to being aimless: this is over simplified advice, but just choose a direction and go. There’s nothing stopping you from changing course. People change careers, schools, and relationships all the time. Don’t be the person to say no to yourself! You can find a way, even if it’s walking or public transportation. Give yourself some credit because you’re not as inept as you think. Lastly, you’d benefit from talking to a therapist about your lack of motivation and fears that stop you from doing things.

"This is mostly a rant.

The gender ratio of therapists is skewed. There are many more female than male therapists. There is little attention put into the male perspective and male issues. Most men in the spotlight aren't the ordinary or lower status men but the men who are already high status or high achieving, so understanding of the ordinary male perspective is missing in society. I did a search and there are actually more therapists that focus on LGBT issues than men's issues despite there being many more men than LGBT people. 

There are fewer male therapists and even when I look specifically only for a male therapist it's hard for me to relate to many of them as a man who is shy and isn't very masculine. I need a therapist to be more comforting and sensitive. Generally, the type of men who choose to become a therapist don't struggle with the same issues that I have (male loneliness and shyness) because if they did, they wouldn't pick a career working with people. The male therapists who seem to be comforting and sensitive to me are usually not straight, so they don't have much of a better understanding of my straight male issues than women would. 

With female therapists, I'm afraid that they either don't get it (it being male loneliness, anxiety etc) or don't care or sympathize with my problems. I doubt many of them had the dream of helping lonely shy men when they chose to become a therapist. Many of them seem to be focused on children's or women's issues in their profiles. And while female therapists would do a better job of making me feel more listened to and comfortable with them, I'm also scared that I would develop a crush for them and then they would end therapy because of it and I have to start over again.

I don't know how to find the right therapist for me. I have an easier time job searching than this."	borntolance	post	35.45495678771687	female	White	0.9984421133995056	na	na	na	19	malementalhealth

One thing I found myself having to remember when I was in therapy is that therapists are trained professionals and, if they're any good at their job, their gender should not make a difference. Presumably part of the reason one sees a therapist is for them to help YOU figure out how to deal with certain things or problems YOU are having. Whether they're male, female, or otherwise should, in theory, only matter to you, the patient, and your level of comfort with one gender vs others. It sounds like you just haven't found a therapist who you're comfortable enough with. And that's okay. Therapy is a process and finding the right one can take time.

"Currently, society is still very intolerant of LGBT people. Despite all the support you see on mainstream news, they still receive unfathomable amounts of harassment from random strangers every day and are still disowned by their families. Their mass mental health crisis is fueled by continued attacks for merely existing. Even today in the liberal bastion of California, I still hear my gay and trans friends have slurs yelled at them by strangers. 

A lot of therapists and social workers are LGBT people who entered the field to help other LGBT people in need. Therapy, in America, has usually been treated as a shameful and effeminate thing since you're doing nothing but talking about your feelings.

Going by how you skipped on male therapists for not being masculine enough, I'm not sure you're going to therapy for the right reasons.

"You're definitely right about the balance being skewed, it can be very hard to find a therapist that fits into a particular niche or specialty, though it seems wrong that there's so few therapists that can adress men's issues in a fundamental level. Though if it's any comfort, you'd be surprised about how many therapists are capable of understanding particular issues, especially if their specialty can be considered adjacent.

Finding the ""right"" therapist can be pretty laborious but please don't get discouraged! It might be worth it to reach to a couple therapists ahead of time with the particular issues you want adressed and see if they've had any experience with that or anything similar. Many might not list it, and others may feel more confident in addressing mens issues more than others, regardless of gender/personal experience.

I've gone through a few since a young age, and it might just be my luck, but I've had better outcomes and more amicable experiences with therapists with an LGBTQ+ specialty, even though none of my issues stem from gender/sexuality specifically, they seem to be more open-minded and less averse to adressing things outside of their specialty. In the same vein, I've had mixed results with other men, even ones that theoretically could mirror me, and equally mixed results with women, in which I tended to feel like both would gently dodge my issues and draw my attention away rather than adressing them directly.

Then again, everyone's results are different, just please don't delay seeking help too much in hopes of getting it right on the first go! Sometimes you might go through one or two, maybe even more in search of help you need with what you feel needs adressing. A therapists' personal experience and demographic is usually a poor reflection of how they'd actually be able to address your problems. Mens' issues are seeing more of a rise to the forefront recently, so my hopes lie in more being able to make it their specialty soon!"	borntolance	reply	na	na	na	0.9984421133995056	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

Since nobody in the comments has said it, I will. I completely agree with you. The goal is to open up to the therapist, and for many men, that’s going to mean speaking to another man. You shouldn’t be questioned for not wanting to discuss certain issues with a therapist who matches your demographic. It’s natural to seek out advice from those who have already faced the problems you are facing. If the roles were reserved, I’m sure women would be far more understanding about not wanting to discuss unique hardships like menopause or childbirth with a male therapist.	borntolance	reply	na	na	na	0.9984421133995056	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"There's a psychological phenomenon called ""the call of the void"" where people who look over a cliff then have the almost undeniable urge to jump. It's more common than you think, and can apply in other ways ""stuck your hand in the fire"" or ""kick that tea-cup dog"". 

That being said, it looks like you're dealing with some low self-value, and if you mix that with the intrusive impulse call of the void, then it becomes self-destructive behavior and choices over time.

It doesn't go away on its own. It doesn't get quieter. You have to make value of self. You have to find purpose, and something you want more than just survival. Some people have their partner, or children, or even pets as their existential life-raft, some of us have gamer friends. 

Don't place too much energy in trying to get happier, find out what healthy impulses you want to try, and see if happiness isn't an accidental by-product. If you're able to entertain the idea of trying to drink an entire body of water, then is going for a jog that much worse? 

Anyway, I will kick myself off the soapbox, and close off with this; I've been in this mode at your age, and it led me to some pretty stupid choices I wish I could take back. Even after all that, I still managed to find a measure of peace by finding something I wanted more than any high, than death as an escape from monotonous purposelessness, more than social acceptance through conformity. And I did. I'm still bitter, jaded, and could easily go back to merrily surrenduring to chaos as a last hurrah, but I'm content watching the world get up to wild shenanigans while I eat popcorn off to the side.

"I’m sorry about the school situation, maybe look into tutoring or office hours? In regards to everything else, easier said than done but you gotta stop focusing on others & what you don’t have. You’ll always find someone in a better situation & thinking about it is just inviting unnecessary stress into your life. The only person you should compare yourself to is the old you; that can be the you from 3 years ago, or even yesterday. Everyone has a different path & timeline. Your friends who’re talented or getting a bunch of views & subscribers have likely been training for years at their craft(s) or knew how to cater to & build the type of following they want. Not you’re fault if you didn’t win the genetic lottery (athletics) or your parents didn’t enroll you in music lessons as a kid, that’s just the hand you were dealt. If you have any ideas on streaming I’d suggest brainstorming with friends you have good chemistry with and a shared interest (a game, anime, book series, etc.) and go from there. 

Also, to make things start going your way a bit more: set small attainable goals regularly. It doesn’t have to be anything crazy; drinking water everyday, keeping a consistent journal, going for a walk everyday, etc. Accomplishing goals no matter how big or small always feels good and that in and of itself is things going your way. Small things but you have to build yourself up so you’re confident in your abilities to conquer the big things. You don’t train for a marathon doing it over and over, you start at 1 mile, then 2, then 5 & so on. Life is no different. 

You go to the gym here & there, make it more regular. Working out relieves stress. You don’t have to do a full routine every time, keep it light every so often so you don’t get overwhelmed. And once that becomes a habit you can maintain, add another, and then another. You say you have no talent, pick a hobby that speaks to you & give it a shot. Not a “damn I’m not Picasso” after a week shot, actually find something you like doing regardless of the potential views & subscribers it could lead to & work to get better at it. You don’t have to be world class, just better than the old you. And you also don’t have to share it. Seeking validation thru social media isn’t the move as appealing as it may be. Don’t get good at drawing just to post it on IG & obsess over some selfie or a stupid meme getting more traffic than you. Find something that feels like therapy to you & enjoy it purely for you.

“Seeing people be successful… on YouTube, Twitch, professional athlete” - With this mindset, there are many levels of success that you are interpreting as a failure if you do not reach the top 0.1%.

“I said I’m going to change my life this year”. This is another logical trap. When you feel like you are behind, you need a “big win” to turn things around.

I've discussed my suicidal thoughts on here for a while now, how the pain of hunger and the cold have made me contemplate for a long time.

Well tonight is that night.

I want to suffer, I want it to hurt, after all it's all I deserve.

I've lost everything this last year. The woman I loved, all my friends, my family. 

Hell, I can no longer even eat or keep warm thanks to my mental illness destroying my capacity to even work or function.

"Hi.

I hear you.

Oftentimes, posts like these can be exaggerated, but I am going to respond with the utmost seriousness in regard to your situation.

 I want you to stay around and read whatever comments come here. After all, what do you have to lose?

My man, I'm not going to sit here and say that I understand what you are going through. But just knowing someone in the world is hurting as much as you are brings me to tears.

I want you to think about the potential happiness your future could bring. At any point in time, you could stumble across some amazing people, make some true friends, find love, a family.

Think of the effect you will have on those in your past or present. I'm sure you've already met some really amazing people who are no longer close to you for whatever circumstances.

Brother, we need you. Honestly. People who can see the darkness in the world are the ones who can muster up the courage to bring light into it.

I personally sincerely apologize that our world has made you feel this way, but I want to offer some options.. 

These may not he glamorous, but as you can tell, we are not in a glamorous situation.

Food banks can help you. They are there to support you. They may not exactly care about your situation, but you can use them as a tool to improve it.

We have shelters for men or homeless who can provide a bed and a roof for you. You may even meet some interesting characters there. 

Your past can be amended. If there is even one contact in your phone that you wish you could reconcile with, I strongly suggest calling them and telling them everything they meant to you. After all, nothing to lose now, right? 

Call your parents and tell them you love them, apologize for whatever has gone on in your life. Or tell them off if that's what you are feeling. Give them the truth you hold inside you.

Making friends, although hard, is possible at any point. We have tons of communities now with things like Discord or local events. If you need a friend, we are out here. You can feel free to DM me anything, and I will reply to you.

We have financial support for people truly struggling. Have you gone down and spoken with your bank about your situation? You would be surprised the support we have now a days.

I get it. This world seems like it's spinning in the wrong direction. People are as selfish as ever and it seems like no one gives a fuck about anyone anymore. The anger I feel every day looking at our modern world is unmatched.

But I believe we have been given this sight for a reason. Have you ever wondered why other people don't seem to care about the way the world is? I think it's because we have a duty to change it. You have a purpose. It's just unclear right now what it is.

So, my dear friend. If you truly are planning to go, you would be giving me hope by taking whatever steps you can to improve your situation before you go.

I mean really, exhaust every option.

I love you, and seeing you succeed would bring hope that you couldn't possibly imagine. You can do great things, and be a great person. Sometimes all it takes is reaching out for some help.

I have tried to kill myself four times in my life, so believe me when I say that I really, really get it. But please stay! For me, life never got any better, but it did get easier. I will always carry the burdens of me. I will always carry my terrible past; things I have done to others, things I have done to myself, and things that have been inflicted upon me. None of that goes away, but it has gotten easier to carry these weights. And you know what? Maybe this next one is weird but overcoming my worst self has been one of the most badass things I’ve done.

Finally going to achieve one of my lifelong dreams and make good money to support my family. Finished and  on my own driving, generally happy and excited I'm foing what I want with my life finally. Then 3 months later and then I got fired..its the same crap that happens everytime, i work my ass off and try to prove myself amd end up getting fired 3 to 6 months later...now I have no idea what to do with my life.. I've suffered from depression and ADHD and anxiety my whole life but I manage. I've had 2 attempts in my life. I'm 7 years sober now but the bottles are calling me again...I'm scared of going numb again and not giving a shit anymore. I have a family that depends on me which is a blessing and a curse. My family loves me and cares and wants me here, but at the same time I just want to exit life at this point and I can't do that to them. I have no idea where to go from here.

"Update: I’m overcoming my demons and no longer allow this to ruin my life. I believe there’s hope for me, and the rest of you too.

Original post:
I’ve always had trouble talking to the opposite gender, with men it’s not an issue but my socialphobia towards women is a major hindrance to my happiness. I’m 25 years old and I’ve only had one true relationship, maybe two but it hardly counts because it was long distance and short-lived, and I’ve only had sex with that one close distance girlfriend I had, which was years ago now and I didn’t even feel a true spark in that relationship which led to its eventual end. 

Now I’ve been alone for years, haven’t been successful in changing that; I’ve tried but the few women I was talking to would just play games with me and it never ended up working out in the end. This is the primary source of my depression. I am definitely not a mysogynist as I think hatred of anyone based on their demographic status is detestable but I’d be lying if I said the doomer blackpilled attitude of the bullshit incel propaganda wasn’t starting to take hold of me. I just wanna love and be loved man, this shit is making me think about taking my own life sometimes. I’d rather die than be alone forever.

Here’s your problem.

Dating & socialisation are skills. You get good at them by exercise.

And it’s a nuMbers game so you need to keep doing it until it clicks with the right girl.

"I understand where you're coming from. Personally I didn't find much success with dating or relationships in real life until I was about 24-25. By that time most of my guy friends or other guys I knew had already dated around quite enough and had even gotten laid too (while I stayed a dateless kissless virgin for a good while).

Eventually during one of my stints of self improvement and dating app swiping, I was able to match a bit more and even get a date or two going as well. Of course eventually that would lead me to my first kiss and sexy times but yeah even then I still struggled with having to go on date after date to experience disappointment, ghosting, or whatever else that just makes dating such a drag.

I'd say some of it had to do with my self improvement efforts but another factor is also just not caring too much about having a successful date either because being too conscious of that can be counterproductive on just being comfortable with yourself and confident while you're out there seeing women. I think one mistake that screwed up several good opportunities for me would be when I just did not take a break from the dating app when I should have. There were times where it weighed down on me enough to the point my responses were less than fun to deal with and honestly it probably lead to some of these women ghosting me too.

It's a lot easier said than done of course because even as you try to stay self aware you can still find yourself doing the behaviors that are counterproductive to your own dating life. Just try to look at it as a learning experience and do your best to stay conscious of it. If you missed the signs on taking a break and end up screwing up don't get too hard on yourself over it because at least you realized it and took responsibility instead of just pointing fingers at others unnecessarily. Anyway, I hope your dating life gets better my friend and just know that you aren't any less of a man or person for struggling in this aspect of life."

"Some background: I had loving parents, but my mother divorced when I was still 1 or 2 years old and she had to bring me up all by herself. She did and continues to do everything that she can just for me to feel loved and understood, and she tries to support me in every way she can. When I was 13, our family decided that I should live in the countryside with my grandfather for a while, probably because it was getting tough for my mother. My grandfather was kind and spoiled me when he could, but of course I've tried to help me with the stuff that you usually do at the countryside. Even though he was lenient on me, he might've become a father figure of sorts for me. I've continued to live with him up until I've graduated from high school, visiting my mother at the holidays. All in all, I think that I have a nice family and I'm grateful to them now.

Maybe this has all began since when I was a child, either still in kindergarten or in 1st grade of elementary school. I vividly remember a dream I had one day - there was only a little girl with face that I couldn't quite make out. Nothing else. When I woke up, I was truly shaken and sad that she isn't real. I remember being woken up to get ready to go out, going to the bathroom, looking in the mirror and breaking out in tears. Of course I didn't even understand love or other complex emotions back then, so I was completely bewildered at what has happened to me and why did I feel these emotions. That was the first time that I've felt something like this.

Fast forward to when I was around 13-14 years old. I had my best friends from my first school (still have them), just normal friends that I had in countryside as well as some good acquaintances from the new school. There were a lot of delinquents but I could more or less coexist with them and sometimes even discuss something while we were in school, even though I consider myself to be an introvert. I think I didn't really have problems with communicating, except a normal healthy dose of anxiousness that probably all teens have. At this time, I began to notice how my fellow peers were beginning to be obsessed with relationships and dating, yet the things that they've worried about and their relationships itself felt so shallow to me that I was thinking that I could never understand them. I had some interest in opposite sex, but didn't give those thoughts any special attention. But one day I encountered one fictional work of romance that moved me deeply, especially because of one female character. That's when I slowly began to understand my love and in the future my problem. I began to look for all the works that had a character with a similar personality archetype and specific traits. Every time I saw them my heart would flutter and I would be lost in pure, romantic thoughts and feelings. It felt like true bliss, even though they weren't real. That didn't matter to me. Eventually, I began to practice meditation and visualisation techniques intensely. I also began to dream of the characters (or girls based on these characters) often, and writing down those dreams. During my meditation and visualisation sessions I would try to dive into my so-called ""dream world"" and try to visualise the girl in details, as well as visualise all the emotions and personality that she should have. I got so invested in doing this and meditation that I could just put my head down on the table, close my eyes and almost immediatly clear my head from thoughts. As a result of meditation my mindset changed forever. My head became much clearer and serene even after I've stopped doing this eventually. It felt really amazing and liberating to stop the constant flow of dozens of thoughts constantly, and even though I've lost my ability to mediate so deeply now my mindset is still the same.

When I was 15, these feelings and thoughts became extreme. I experienced emotional breakdowns often because of me understanding that I could never be with her. It was at this point that I was contemplating suicide because I believed that we could be together after I have passed from this life. This didn't affect my everyday life, in fact the only thing that I've heard from my parents and friends was their surprise at my disinterest in dating and similar. Nobody knew about my state. I've continued to meditate and thankfuly I've reached some sort of enlightment and broke from this self-destructive circle. The conclusion that I've reached was more or less along these lines: ""I will be with her eventually, so might as well just continue to live and see what this life has to offer and where it will take me. My love will never go away as it is my core, my reason for existing. So I will just continue living while enjoying the feeling of pure love that I have and make it my strength.""

After that my life became more or less normal. I graduated from school, enrolled into university, got my degree. I was growing up as a person, learning about how life works. I never had any problems in communication with others and can mingle with others without problems. I have hobbies, goals in life, dreams things that I enjoy doing or creating. I take care of myself, I like to dress stylish the way I like. People (guys and girls both) comliment me and call me a dandy or a gentleman to my amusement lol. Girls showed interest in me, but I've never pursued them. One of my friends even told me ""Dude, that girl is all over you, I've heard her talking. Why are you not doing anything?"". I feel that if I wanted to I could be in a relationship. But I don't want to. I only exist for my one and only fictional love and this love is pure and ideal, we both didn't and won't have anyone before us either in romantic or intimate sense and we can only exist for eachother bound by fate. This is the only love that I can imagine. But I can't connect with anyone deeply at all. Even with my best friends. I feel that I never had a person that could understand me and with whom I could share my feelings and inner thoughts.

I'm not even sure if I'm depressed right now or I just want to let this out. Maybe it's just seasonal, somethimes this happens to me. I feel a bit lonely and try to connect with strangers online, but that usually doesn't end well with either them or me drifting apart quickly. I've tried to route my experiences and emotions into a creative outlet by making a visual novel because they affect me emotionally the most. However, because my writing is horrible my team, my friends and people who have read it think that the story is bad. I myself think that I couldn't quite express everything I wanted to, so I doubt if I'll ever come back to make another VN after recieving all the criticism and I'm not sure if I should try to express myself again.

It's winter right now, everything is white and depressing and I can't go out much because of the cold. Maybe that's what bringing my mood down now, as well as some stressful things in life. But I beileve that all problems are solvable and everything passes as long as you accept yourself. So maybe it's just seasonal after all and I just want to share this with someone.

Thank you for reading this enormous wall of text. It feels good to share these feelings after almost a decade of holding them in.

"Hey OP,

I understand where you're coming from. Reality is difficult and anxiety-inducing, and the girl you see in your head is an ideal that doesn't give you any of these problems. I remember dreaming up a similar idea in my childhood of developing a ""pure connection"" to a girl in my head (a real person, but someone I didn't know), like some kind of literal psychic space we both shared where we could be connected and happy and experience true love.

But holding this fantasy in your head is keeping you disengaged from the real world, as you've said throughout your post. This dream person is siphoning your energy away from things that exist and matter. If you've watched Inception by Christopher Nolan, think about the relationship between Dom and Mal - he keeps her in his head where she inhabits his dreams, not wanting to let her go. It's only at the end of the film when Dom realizes Mal is an imperfect recreation - not flawed in all the ways the real Mal was, not beautiful in the way the real Mal was. And so he gives up his fantasy and decides to let her go. I can see the parallels between this and your relationship with the girl in your head. Maybe you'll follow Dom's footsteps and go through the same journey.

The real world is cold and harsh and unforgiving, and just as much as you I want to feel understood and accepted and loved. But it's comprised of other real people just like ourselves, people with problems and fears and dreams, and it's all we have. So both of us need to go out there and find those people, make connections, and experience the world for what it actually is."

"I’m sure if you’re an active member of this sub, then you want to grow as a person. And you probably already know what you should be doing, and know that if you did it , then it would have a positive result. So why do you still not do what you know you should be doing? The answer is because you’re a human being. In other words, a walking rationalization. Your brain is trying to rationalize doing what will make you feel good right now and conserve the most amount of energy. I know this from experience. I’ve wasted so much time rationalizing. Which is why I’m prepared to utilize every recourse possible to make sure I get results this year. And that’s why I started an accountability group. 

The group takes place over Instagram. What takes place is that every day we check in to the group to say we’ve completed our goals. We also have a weekly call to discuss our goals and development. We also read and discuss a new book every month. We also track our progress throughout the year to make sure we’re tangibly improving. If you’re very serious about your personal growth this year, let me know and I will add you into this group."	alanthemartyr	post	19.992616752487187	female	White	0.0036775984335690737	na	na	na	6	malementalhealth

"So, Do You See A Correlation Between Mental Health and Religion/Spirituality? How’s Fairh Helped or Hurt You? (Here’s my take).  Let me start by saying I’m a bit of an odd case. I’m a 23 yr old African American with more diagnosed mental illnesses than I can count on one hand. I’m also a Norse Pagan (Thor, Odin, Tyr, just to give you an idea). I could honestly care less who’s right and who’s wrong with the religion debate. If they exist, fine. If not fine.  

I STRUGGLE with chronic depression. I could be having a great day, talk in a group of people, overthink one sentence or word I said and then my mindset spirals.

"Hi there,

I love your question and thank you for sharing how spirituality has shaped you. For me my faith has helped me beyond what I could imagine. I was an atheist for a large part of my life. I did not believe that there was a God or that there was any kind of Supreme being. I had a friend who had similar life experiences as I did that found faith. Mainly my faith has helped take the weight off of my shoulders. I know that God is their to help me. Though we have bodily ailments and affliction God helps us through it and bears our burdens and anxieties. When I find it that I get down to a deep dark place and my mind starts going I can refocus and give it to God and he helps. If you would like to chat further please message me.

I try to be passionate about politics, religion, current events, philosophy, social issues and sometimes the environment, but I think with being passionate about these topics then comes an obsession with always being heavily emotionally invested into these things, then it doesn't help that your lizard brain always has that urge to see all sides be equally shit on, so to give an example

Let's say I see a post hating on Trump supporters

Then my lizard brain gives into an urge to a post shitting on liberals/Biden supporters, etc

Or gender issues for example 


So let's say you have a typical rape story, woman is a victim, man is the perpetator, man gets away scotch-free, then you have your fair share of ""This is why men shouldn't be allowed on the streets"" type comments, lizard brain seeks content on the other side of the aisle consuming misogynistic/reactionary content on red pill/manosphere/mgtow forums, but in reality I want gender supremacists of both sides to be held accountable and so the downward spiral of doomscrolling and negative media consumption continues"	Cookiecuttermaxy	post	29.242208553345638	female	White	0.9986989498138428	na	na	na	3	malementalhealth

For me it just helped hearing it so here it is. Take care of yourself first before you take care of others or you'll fail at both. After you can do that, you don't have any responsibility to take care of family except your partner, kids, and whatever you sign on to with your partner. It's your choice who deserves it.

"Nope, it is not spoiled. You are just seeing things for what they are. Most people do not have ambition. While society will tell you that you are being a ""try-hard"", they can only say this, because they are the majority. Hence, they get to decide the narrative. In a different society like a future spartan society or something, they would be considered - for lack of a better word - losers.

I work at a hospital, and I constantly see people not using 1% of their potential. It is sad to see. But, there is nothing you can do, because everyone has the right to waste away if they so choose. 

My advice is that you should stop wishing for a better familial unit. If they wanted to change, they would have. Also, stop trying to be the hero. This is not some hero anime. Get serious about what you can control and stop using your limited resources to help those who won't help themselves (even if you care deeply about them).

We know firsthand how vital online mental health information is. Have you recently been diagnosed or self-diagnosed with a mental illness, like depression, anxiety, or another mental illness? Did you seek information online about mental health before and during the diagnosis process (given that you're here, we think the answer is yes!). This research will let us see ways to improve how apps and platforms deliver, moderate, and support this important content.

If you use Reddit, engage with content related to mental health, and are at least 18 years old, we want to talk with you for about 60 minutes. We’ll ask you to talk about your experiences - and then you will be compensated for your time. There will also be an option to provide platform data for additional compensation.

I think that one of the best ways is the most grassroots way you can: by checking in on your male friends if you think they're not doing great. It can be uncomfortable to get emotionally intimate with your friends, especially if they're going through something silently. But I think that it shows that you care about them as people and that they can count on you for anything. Sometimes just letting people get things off their chest can be the first step in the recovery process.	Mrprivatejackson	reply	na	na	na	0.0017739047762006521	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"I'm asking this question because I have never experienced this before and was wondering what it feels like when a woman is attracted to you. A little about myself, I am a 47/M that is very physically unattractive to women that I have been called ugly and fat my whole life ever since I can remember. No female has ever shown any interest in me and it's not for a lack of trying either. Before when I was younger and didn't think I was unattractive, I had some confidence and approached women before being respectful. nice, and was myself but have only ever experienced rejection. In time, by my early 30's, my confidence faded away completely when a female that I was interested in told me why she wasn't attracted to me and she said it was because my face was ugly and gross to her. She pointed everything wrong with my face and told me that is why no woman has any interest in me. I never thought I was so physically unattractive until that point in my life even after being called ugly and fat my whole life. When I went home I really looked at myself in the mirror and seen everything wrong that she was saying about my face and body. I understood then why I never got a compliment about how I looked my entire life and everything started to make sense as to why no woman ever had any interest in me. I am living proof that it is impossible to have real confidence and good self esteem as a man if you have never experienced any positive reinforcement your whole life.

I guess the reason I'm trying to say this is that other peoples opinions are not the thing that fixes you, I had to fix myself. I'm 40 now, and single, and I'm left wishing I had more confidence when I was younger. I go to the gym a lot now and I've put on some muscle and I do feel good about myself now but it's because I've put the work in.  


In the end - all we can do is work to make ourselves proud of ourselves, to validate ourselves because trust me, even if someone walked up to you today and told you you were beautiful would you believe them?  


I know that I didn't believe them back then, but I think I probably would if it happened now.

"I’m pretty decent looking and a few times in 23 years. The barrier to male validation from women that you don’t know is high and, and I believe this is due to the fact many men take compliments as indicators of interest, so women have therefore adopted this fact to only give compliments to men they’re extremely attracted to and would basically want to get with solely off looks, which is a small percent of the male population. 

Find a ltr and you will be validated, but as a man you must first self-actualise through such things as meditation or journalling  to get above needing approval, as not many men ever get constant validation, and if you rely on validation like many women, you will be starving for it your whole life.

Rise above it and live for yourself. Easier said than done, especially when you see v attractive men getting validated, but unfortunately life isn’t fair"	thelostkid5	reply	na	na	na	0.01084853708744049	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"Only compliments I've had were from women I was dating - one told me I was a bit of a hunk when she saw me with undress and she did admit she first realised she was attracted to me when she checked out my package. I was both flattered and embarrassed.

Visually the closest comparison I've had thrown my way is that I look like The Undertaker (although I'm a foot shorter). I was so told quite a bit that I had a look of Jack Nicholson - it's all in the eyebrows.

Thing is, unless you have a lot of factors going for you, you aren't going to get (m)any compliments from women you aren't dating. My brother has been described as a ""sex god"" (we don't look anything like each other) and I never heard a woman give him a compliment, he never needed it. And confident guys don't - everyone knows some short funny looking guy who gets the ladies and you can bet he's not getting compliments, he's out there doing his thing purely motivated by himself. That's the kind of guy you want as inspiration, not some Brad Pitt looking genetic lottery winner.

> In time, by my early 30's, my confidence faded away completely when a female that I was interested in told me why she wasn't attracted to me and she said it was because my face was ugly and gross to her. She pointed everything wrong with my face and told me that is why no woman has any interest in me.

That's ruthless - you'd have to be the world's most confident motherfucker not to let that get to you. I don't think I'd have left the house for a month after that!

"Our dad was very traditional back when he was with us and never let her out the house without him. He came home drunk a lot and all I can remember was fighting and arguing at home. They're both immigrants and my dad ended up going back home to try to make money there leaving us to fend for ourselves here. That was over a decade and a half ago and now that I'm older I can actually understand what was going through his mind, but it's been a rough 10 years. My mom had no understanding of the culture, the language, anything at all because she wasn't allowed to integrate while my dad was here. She was pretty much cast into a foreign land and left to fend for herself with 2 kids to raise. She bit the bullet hard and worked her ass off to make sure we'd have an education, a roof under our heads while we got through school, she pushed money into life insurance to cover for us in the case anything happened to her, she did everything possible for us with the limited resources she had. She was the kindest, most stubborn, iron-willed and hardworking woman I will ever know. Underneath all that I've known for awhile now she's probably depressed, resentful of my dad, herself, and though she tried to hide it we would still get into fights growing up. I have a lot of blind spots due to my upbringing, there's so much I don't know, never got to learn how to do, and I'm trying really hard to hurry up and get it together. I don't know if I'm going to make it in time, I don't know when might be the last day I see her. We had a fight today and I got to see how far her mental health has declined, she's given up on herself, she's given up on her hope and dreams, she said all she wants is for my brother and I to be happy. She did a damn good job of raising us and no matter how far back we are from being like ""regular people"" I am goddamn sure I'll catch up and surpass everyone else because of all that I've gone through. The problem is, I'll never be happy if I can't find a way to make her happy. I'm 1 year away from finishing school and after I'm done I can work on my social anxiety problems, I can learn how to dress, go places, meet people, work with tools, have hobbies, the world is my oyster and I know it. Despite that, I'm unwilling to let myself do all that until I can put my mom at ease. I know she isn't self sufficient and she won't be able to recognize her job is done even after I've become independent. She will get worse and I fear the worst will happen if I don't find a way to fix her problems. I want her to stop working, have time to herself, explore the things in life that make her happy, travel without worrying about us, I want her to live for herself and not just us. I would rather suffer together with her than take the opportunity to be happy alone because I might never see her again after that. I'm doing everything I can but fuck.... my mom's aged so much and it only hit me tonight that I barely recognize her. She's out of steam, probably for awhile now. She's nothing like she used to be, she doesn't even have it in her to cry anymore. That's the only way she could alleviate all the anxiety and pain before but she's taken that away from herself because she doesn't feel like she can afford to. She was never a role model mentor or hero to me but seeing her the way she is now, I feel a sense of pain I can't describe. I told her about how she's aged and she left to go cry. I don't like listening to my mother cry but I'd rather have to listen to that than know she's bottling everything up. I have a number of things I need to address for our future. I've been sacrificing my health, I've sacked all my hobbies, I've purged everything to make sure I will succeed in school. I've never been a good student since elementary school, I never performed well in high school, but I'm going to succeed in college. I'm going to see all the health specialists I've neglected over the years, I'm going to build a regular workout routine every week, I'm going to do all the rehab I gotta do to get my body ready to handle anything that comes my way. My success isn't about proving stuff to myself anymore, it's not just about passion, it's not about getting it done for the sake of getting it done, it's about securing a future where my mom can be happy and remember what life before being forced to raise us was like. I'm probably going to age like my mom, a lot over the next while but I don't care. Doing everything I can and exerting myself is better than regretting not doing enough when the day comes and she's gone. I'm going to be selfish for awhile and put my wishes before my mom's. There's a bit of a language barrier between us so I don't know if she'll ever know how much I care about her, I don't know if she'll ever know how much I've grown, I don't know if she'll ever see me as anything else besides the young depressed and emotional kid I was. None of that matters to me, I just want her to be okay."	grounded_star	post	25.698615827519507	female	White	0.005753662902861834	na	na	na	6	malementalhealth

"This was so heartwarming and I can very much appreciate this sentiment.  I’m not a man (forgive me if I’m overstepping by chiming in, since this resonated with me), but I can tell you that there is nothing in this life that a woman like that wants more, than to see you and your siblings succeed and find your own happiness.  I know it’s counterintuitive, but as much as your mom deserves a break, she likely doesn’t want that break to come from you (esp not while you’re in college or in the infancy of your career while you’re still building your own foundation).  

The ideas you’re displaying about doing the right thing for your mental and physical health, and your inclination to be a bit selfish to ensure that’s successful, is very on point, and will be honoring her sacrifice.  You have to honor her decision to make all those sacrifices by working on yourself, and pouring into yourself.  Try to feel okay about prioritizing yourself as best you can.  She made those choices to work that hard and give you those opportunities, specifically so you wouldn’t have to sacrifice and have it wear on you, the way it wore on her, and the wear and tear on her already happened.  If you were to do anything else, her sacrifices would be for nothing.  Let her image inspire you.

I know how it feels to watch your parent aging, to begin recognizing how valuable time with them is, and it’s terrifying.  But the best thing you can do other than trying to do right for yourself, is appreciate the small moments with her - whether it’s at times helping with things she can’t do herself (esp physically), and being fully present when you are around her for dinner and such (put your phone away).  Go for walks together (it’s good for her health, esp as she’s aging, to be in motion), express gratitude verbally even if you bumble through it seemingly without much grace, and if it’s accessible, take her to new places she might appreciate when you stumble onto it.  Maybe it’s a great scenic view, a cool art exhibit she might appreciate (your student ID can likely get discounts to things you wouldn’t imagine), or simply bringing home a new food you really enjoyed eating so she can enjoy it with you.  Be kind...and for the love of all things holy, don’t mention her aging lol.  Encourage her to prioritize her health.  Tell her she looks beautiful the next time you’re in sunlight enjoying a moment with her.  Compliment her when you see her happy or when you appreciate her efforts (“you’re such a great cook” etc.). You can give back in small ways while still pouring into yourself.  

Most of all, try to be kind to yourself on your journey, as you make mistakes and have bad days.  It’s okay if you still struggle in school.  To change it, the key in college is to change your underlying habits and ask for help.  If your college has a center for those with learning disabilities, go to it and learn what resources are available to you (even if you don’t have a learning disability - I went more for ADHD/ASD issues that impacted my organizing my deadlines and such, more than actual learning difficulties). I was somewhat effortlessly pretty good with school until college, and then the sudden lack of structure and oversight really knocked me over.  I screwed up college initially, took a break, and one of the things I did differently upon my return was seeking out those resources.  I also made a rule for myself that I couldn’t actively avoid my shame in school.  For me this meant if I was late to class, missed a class, or falling behind in some way, that I couldn’t leave their next class without speaking to the teacher or arranging a time to meet them.  It forced me to not hide from where I wasn’t doing well and ask for help (and often it was such a relief to not be anxious about it anymore, that I was able to better focus on and complete what was needed).  

My point is don’t walk into your first year of college just thinking you’ll succeed this time, go into it using your keen self awareness (which is evident in your post) as your strength instead, to offset where you are weaker - “here are the areas I really struggle, and I’m showing up to the hard things like asking for help on all the stuff I feel like I shouldn’t need help with.”  You want to learn to be kinder to the parts of yourself that you struggle with, to recognize them and show them some grace rather than wasting energy being frustrated with those parts.  We all have bad moments, we all struggle with different things, but as my own mother frequently reminds me - “be kind to yourself, and don’t let perfect be the enemy of the good.”

It's also clear that you have a lot of inner strength and resilience, and that you've faced a lot of challenges in your life already. It's commendable that you're taking care of yourself and working hard in school so that you can be the best version of yourself and help your mother.

"Bro you helped me on my thread so I wanna help you in any way I can.

For your social anxiety have you ever tried CBT? Meditation/mindfulness? Yoga? Have you ever tried Ayahuasca?

Regards helping your mom and changing her life, there is only so much you can do. Even if you dedicated your whole life to this cause, I don’t think you’d make things for her the way you want them to be in your head. Your perfect INFJ vision for her life will never come to fruition, but you can achieve maybe 20% of it if you give it a good effort. If she herself wanted the things that you want for her as much as you want them for her, she’d already be working towards them. But there may be things that are holding her back that you can remove for her, or ways you can boost her or encourage her towards them. Remember she wants life the way she wants it, not the way you want it for her. But you could maybe discuss with her, or privately work out, which things you want for her that she also wants for herself, and focus your efforts on these things specifically. This will bring the greatest return-for-effort as your will/motivation/energy will be aligned with hers, rather than fighting her wishes and her resistance.

As painful as this will be to hear- you want be able to stop, or prevent, or heal, all of her pain. This is the tragedy of life. But you can do a lot, and if you’re INFJ and she doesn’t have many people in her life then you are probably the only person that is either capable or interested enough to do this for her. So give it your best shot! But you won’t be able to give her everything, take all her pain away, and make her life perfect. Even though you want to.

What helped me first was warmth. My life and mood only went up when I got my cat. I got her as a kitten, I took care of her. It gave me something to care about, something I have to protect.

"Action. I like to think of MY depression (and anxiety) as chronic overthinking. I used to hate everything about myself. And I was open about it, even to strangers. Then I’d hate the reaction I got socially for being so negative, then it was a never ending cycle.

I started taking steps to correct my problems. Do I feel ugly? Okay, take some hygiene steps and work on my fashion sense. Not enough money? I got a job going from 30k to 60k. Credit bad? I paid off debt and went from not being able to get anything to purchasing my dream car. Those massive changes (and psychological victories) came from little things. I bought a few more hygiene products, went to an interview in a new field. Etc etc.

"tl;DR delete Facebook, hit the gym, do mushrooms, and read Feeling Good by David burns.  

A mix of Psilocybin, CBT, exercise, and friends saved my life when I was at my all time low. Tldr upfront just in case. 


The way I understand Psilocybin (magic mushrooms) is that it allows you to break out of mental ruts that you're in. We have neural pathways that get stronger and easier to go down with repetition, and it allows you to make new associations and neural pathways that aren't the ones leading to your depression. A good article explaining it far better than I could is: https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/psilocybin-rewires-brain-people-depression

The mushrooms along with CBT helped a lot. The specific boom that helped me a lot was ""Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy by David D. Burns"". It helped me realize that a lot of problems are viewpoint problems and that there are multiple ways to look at a situation, and often when we're depressed we pick the least charitable version and beat ourselves up over it.

It's a bit cliche but exercise. A good flow of endorphins and taking an action that lead to concrete, measurable results that I was in control of made me feel like I was able to positively influence my life through my actions. I lost 80 lbs, going from a size 48 at 360 lbs to squeezing into a size 36 at 280. I looked better, felt better, and had more confidence. This was a combination of diet and exercise, strict calorie counting with myfitnesspal and a training regimen called Couch to 5k.

All this being said I also made time for a social life. I went to dance classes twice a week, played d&d once a week, hung out with friends (and drank vodka with Crystal Light so as not to fuck up my calorie intake). I had a friend who had lost over 150 lbs so I knew it was possible, and people in my life were supportive. I was just working at an easy job that barely paid the bills while living with roommates and focused on my physical and mental health. I stopped doing things for people that didn't give a shit about me, and focused on bringing positive people into my life that I enjoyed being around.


I also didn't have a social media presence that I focused on at all. I know many people spend too much time on the internet looking at people's highlight reels while comparing it to their own blooper reels. Be kind to yourself and limit your interaction with apps like Facebook, Instagram, and even TikTok if they make you feel worse or put you in a bad heads pace after using them. Unsubscribe from subreddits that only make you angry or sad, find some new subreddits that bring you joy. Social media works to keep us engaged at the cost of our mental health because it's easier to generate engagement through rage and negative emotions than it is through happiness because people evolved to have a negativity bias. We are hardwired to look out for bad because stopping to smell the flowers is nice, but if you miss a lion it can all be done, son."

In my experience, you just need to find something you love and focus your time and energy on that thing or those things. It can be a hobby, it can be spending time with loved ones, it can be whatever you need or want it to be. Navigating and learning to live with depression is a never-ending journey and part of that journey is learning to pivot your attention when something is no longer serving you in the way you need it to. You’ll have off days/weeks/months. And that’s okay so long as you allow yourself to feel whatever you’re feeling, completely. Find what you care about most right now and give your all to it. That’s what’s worked for me and maybe it will for you, too.	AxelLemaire	reply	na	na	na	0.9991129040718079	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"Exercise: Just walking and being outside felt great, lost a bit of weight, started running, later lifting. Putting in the work and seeing your body change and get stronger is great. 

Therapy: I've seen a psychiatrist and four psychologists. They all helped in different ways, some more than others. 95%+ has just been talking; surfacing and working through my feelings. Being probed with the right questions that made me verbalise the obvious things that I thought I knew already sometimes led to pivotal breakthroughs.

Meds: I tried a few that mostly made my anxiety way worse before I found one that works. I've been on it (mostly) for close to a decade now.

CBT seems helpful in some situations but not as much in others. For example, if your depression is caused by trauma then CBT will do very little.

Hello I don’t even know how to explain it but when I remembered what happened it saddened me in a form of manner in which I had not felt before I was already living with depression and ptsd , and then that happened.

Suicidality started at age 10 and persisted well into my 30s, still surprises me that I made it.

And in that time I did a great deal of searching for a reason to live, through religions and philosophies. None of it really made sense for the longest time, there were good ideas in the mix but it all sounded a bit too abstract, sort of in the ""just be confident / just feel better"" line of advice you get.

The deal with myself was to stop thinking of way of killing me from the start of the therapy, to take the best chance of it working. And hidding nothing in therapy (well I have some subject I'm not still ready to speak).

Second thing is stoping to blame myself for this situation. From now, I can see that I was putting way more pressure on myself than I was thinking. => that's the ""it's okay to not be okay"". You are not on a good place, and you dont have to blame you on to of that.

Body positivity, fitting in clothes better, even getting the odd double take in public (yeah, that one feels really good!)
Diet, gut health and just cleaning up and telling myself I'm worth good, wholesome (and TASTY) food. This, with the help of natural supplements brought my hormonal and neurological balances back in line.

Working out. It sucks to get started and getting yourself to start is the hardest part, but the endorphins are great. Doesn't have to be the gym, anything that gets your blood moving. I loke longboarding, skiing, biking, lifting, hockey. 

Picking up a hobby I can do at home so I'm not just endlessly scrolling on my phone. Drawing, reading, video games, cooking, writing, new skills, meditation, yoga

"I’m 22, male, and worried that who I am as a person means that I will never find love, or even a relationship. The reasons are as follows:Lifestyle:I spend 8 hours at work, 8 hours sleeping, 1 hour making food and eating it, 1 hour preparing for sleep and waking up, and 3 hours in transit to and from work. This leaves me with 3 hours every day to enjoy companionship with friends, my hobbies and more. This folds into my next problem, which is that my hobbies are either extremely male dominated(Magic:The Gathering) or with a group of friends I’ve known for years, but am not interested in any of then(DnD). Furthermore, my weekends are usually resting, or hanging out with more friends that I’m not interested in, leaving me bereft of any free time to meet women.

Attractiveness:I’m not a terribly attractive man. In all fairness, I’m not unattractive either. I’ve been complimented on my jawline and hair, but I live on the edge between Obesity and Overweight, and my height(5ft6) doesn’t help either. I do work out, enough to have some amount of muscle, but not enough to look terribly strong. I’ve never had a woman interested in me due to my looks, although I have gotten some strange, but flattering messages from men online.

Personality:

Furthermore, while I can be charismatic, I tire quickly during social events. My friends never let me forget the time I invited some friends over for a small party, then slept through a third of it as I was exhausted from interacting with people. Furthermore, I’m a very honest and argumentative man. I like to argue and discuss things, which is likely one of my worst traits in romance and in friendship. I try to dial back and keep an eye out for when my partner isn’t enjoying our argument, but it is one of my vices. Finally, I’m just antisocial. I enjoy keeping a close circle, and not interacting much with strangers. This means I don’t interact with many women, and honestly I like it that way.

What I’m looking for:I have fairly high standards for women that I’m looking for, which given that I’m not a terribly attractive man, are unreasonable. I recognize this, but I don’t see another option without lowering my standards, which would build resentment in any relationship born out of that, and ultimately result in a failed relationship. I’m looking for a woman that wows me when she enters the room, which is likely the top 30% of women. Furthermore, I want us to have compatible life goals and interests, have personalities that work well together, live near enough to each other, and be of similar ages. All of this is reasonable things that everything wants, but the combination of my main interests being male-dominated and me being relatively unappealing means that I can’t imagine the women I want, ever wanting me.

What I want to be valued for:

Another problem that occurs is that I’ve experienced being valued for the things I do offer. I gave emotional support to a friend for a while, and she developed a crush on me because of that. Quite frankly, I really disliked that. In my mind, I did what any decent human being would, and the fact that her feelings developed for something so simple felt like love was occurring as a function of a service I provided to her, rather than being truly effortless. The same thing occurs in my head when I consider being loved for monetary things, the classic gold digger stereotype that every man hears about. I do not want to be loved for the services or products I provide, but I think without those, I am not terribly appealing.

Finally, my main problem is despite all that, I like myself. I like being me, I like my hobbies, I like my friends, I like my lifestyle, and I don’t really want to change any of that. However, I fear because of the exact shape of who I am as a person, I will never be able to find love.

FAQ:Why don’t you get a new job?

Right now, because my 401k vests after a year at my company, and I’m around 6 months in. Maybe this will all change if I get a job closer to my apartment and get a little more free time, but for the next few months, however long it takes to get a job, I’m stuck.

Some kind people have pointed out that unlovable is probably the wrong word, which is fair. I can be loved, I just worry that due to who I am, I will never attain the romantic relationship that I want."	dragonman10000	post	20.7185814091152	male	White	0.9947340488433838	na	na	na	10	malementalhealth

Your standards are a little too high, don’t focus too much on looks as looks will fade over time. Also people can get new hobbies so introducing someone to them could also work. by compatible personalities I hope you don’t mean the same, there are plenty of dynamics that work that are very different. Also something you should consider is that, as you have said you’re not very attractive or unattractive, it’s unlikely a girl will like you without you doing something first, so helping someone get through a rough patch is a valid way of garnering their favor, it’s not something insidious as you make it out to be.

Being valued for qualities and traits that come naturally to you, such as emotional support, is not a negative thing. Love can come from unexpected places and in unexpected ways, but it's important to remember that everyone is deserving of love and companionship. It's important to consider seeking a therapist to help with your confidence and self-esteem. Additionally, consider expanding your social circle and try new activities that interest you, it could lead to new friendships and potential romantic relationships.

I think you should also cover the other side of BDD too. I am an ugly man and have been told I am ugly and fat since I was a child. I am so ugly that no female has ever had any interest in me. Even though I was told I was ugly my whole life, I didn't think I was that bad until a female decided to tell me everything wrong with my face and my appearance that made me really look in the mirror at myself and see how truly ugly I really was and why no female ever wanted me. Ever since then I don't like looking at myself in mirrors or seeing my reflection. I've never take any photos or videos of myself and I don't even like seeing my picture on my drivers license. When I have to go out in public I wear a mask and sunglasses so I can hide what I look like. I also have body issues as well, so I think that BDD can affect a man from head to toe too.

My friend has recently been admitted to a hospital in order to receive some long overdue mental health treatment, and does not want anyone outside my immediate family or his immediate family knowing. He talks to alot of the same people I know and I am trying to think of an excuse for why he's gone for at least a few weeks. He's in college but is taking the semester off to focus on health and any answers would be appreciated. Thank you.

I berate myself. Constantly, yell at myself in the mirror, punish myself for little things and just kick myself around. It’s tearing my down so much but it’s my first reaction when something happens, I’ll yell at myself and slap myself. How can I start changing this?

"You have to do it, and keep doing it every single day.

These negative thought patterns we suffer from have been developed since our childhood, so it will take some time to change them.

These negative thought patterns are forms of self-protection (where we prepare ourselves for failure and disappointment to soften the emotional blow) and ways we can feel like we have control in our lives.

To change it, you have to do some things that feel goofy and unnatural for a long time until they become part of your daily routine.

1 - Keep a notebook or journal where you write about things you're grateful for in your life, no matter how insignificant they may be. (Having internet access, having gas in your car, having food to eat)

2 - Flirt with yourself in the mirror. Pretend you are someone else giving the real you (in the mirror) a compliment. Any compliment, give yourself compliments you've always wanted to hear even if you think you don't deserve them.

3 - Compliment other people as often as possible. Specifically choices people make like, ""You have a great outfit. Your hair style looks sharp today. Nice job you did on your project back there."" Etc. Complimenting others will sometimes be reciprocated, and you both leave the positive interaction feeling a little better.

4 - Unconditional compassion for yourself and everyone else. Be compassionate even to people you think deserve to be hit by a truck. You deserve the love you give to others, and other people should experience the love you give yourself. This will help you live a truly happy life.

5 - Forgive yourself. You can't change the mistakes you've made, but you can learn from them. You are not the sum of your mistakes, but you are defined by your behaviors and how you react to adversity. Allow yourself room to make mistakes, learn from them, and make any necessary changes to prevent yourself from repeating that mistake. It's okay to fail, it's okay to try again and again, it's okay to take as long as you need to accomplish your goals.

Good luck my man. Practice these as often as possible, never stop, and your whole world will change."	Solid-Temperature362	reply	na	na	na	0.9983910918235779	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"Talk to yourself like a friend. 

When you catch yourself slipping remind yourself of this. Easier said than done but with repetition it becomes stronger.

Or imagine what you would say if a good friend of yours that you care about told you how they were feeling and thinking, for example after they screwed something up and feel bad. You’d reassure them and not beat them down they way they are to themselves. Talk to yourself like that."	Solid-Temperature362	reply	na	na	na	0.9983910918235779	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

I personally learnt how to do this through years of therapy so if that is possible it might surely help. Alternatively i felt that writing down an x amount of things you did well today/made you happy today also works. It forces you to look at things more positively and focus on that rather than the negatives. Throughout the time youre doing that you will learn that it gets easier and easier and that those things youre doing good or make you feel better, you might not notice them at the emd of the day when youre looking back but maybe throughout the day until you can acknowledge them while they are happening.

"One thing that really helped me start to get out of that rut of negative self talk was actually to figure out why I was doing it, so I could forgive myself when I noticed I was doing it. Before I spent the time to figure it out, I would notice I was talking poorly about myself, and then beat myself up for having that negative self talk. Which, obviously, isn't the best way to stop talking poorly to myself. 

When I paid attention to my negative self talk, I realized I was doing it because I wanted to be better, and thought that if I criticized myself when I didn't get the outcome I was looking for, then maybe I would next time. Things shifted when I decided to be nice to myself, and think about it as an attempt or an experiment, rather than a mistake or failure. 

Give it a shot, and see how that works for you. If it works, great! If not, you learned something, and can try something different."	Solid-Temperature362	reply	na	na	na	0.9983910918235779	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"This is going to sound stupid, but it helped me to stop my self-loathing thought patterns. For me, it took about **three straight months of doing this** before I noticed any positive changes in my mental health. My negative self-loathing and self-sabotaging thought patterns have almost completely stopped after 5 months of this exercise. 

This exercise will literally rewire your brain, so be patient with it and don't give up. 

Get a journal or even a small notebook that fits in your pocket.

Every day, take a couple of minutes to write:

- 3 things you're grateful for

- 1 things you like about yourself 

Maybe it will work faster if you increase it to 3 things you're grateful for and 5 or more things you like about yourself, but I burn out easily, so I kept it small for myself.

I know what you're probably thinking... ""But there's nothing about myself to like! I have nothing to be grateful for!""

GREAT NEWS!!! You can literally make up qualities about yourself that **YOU WANT TO BE TRUE!!!** Just keep writing positive things about yourself once a day, every day. 

For example, I always thought I was an irredeemable piece of shit who fucked up everything he ever tried and hurt everyone who is unlucky enough to interact with me... so I wrote stuff like:

- I am a good person, I have so much love for my friends, I am a hard and dedicated worker, I am resilient 

If you can't think of anything to be grateful for, be grateful for the fresh air you breathe. Be grateful for the clean water you have to drink. Be grateful for every bite of food that you are lucky enough to have available to you. 

To break out of this vicious cycle, you have to be unapologetically self-loving and unconditionally compassionate to yourself and others.

*Here's a transcription of the image for those who can't see the picture.*

**marcusseldon**

(note: I have no romantic or sexualized experience myself, so I admit \*some* of these points rely entirely on secondhand stuff and media)

One thing I think is not talked about very much is that straight men live pretty much desexualized lives if we’re not actually having sex at that moment, and then there’s not much room to be the object rather than subject.

As I’ve said before, we men don’t have clothing options for “dressing sexy” in masculine clothing (there is cross dressing but that is different). There’s no male equivalent to the short skirt or low cut top. There’s no male lingerie that isn’t seen as a joke.

Further, we just don’t get validation for our sexuality outside of a sexual partner. We are almost never complimented for our looks or sexiness from platonic friends like women are, especially same sex friends.

There really aren’t many straight male role models for raw aesthetic sexiness in mainstream culture (besides unnaturally muscled men). In fiction, male characters are almost never attractive for embodying sexiness but rather for doing things (saving the world, being extremely witty, being a genius, winning the tournament, etc.). Their sexiness is non-aesthetic and sometimes is in spite of their aesthetics.

Anecdotally, it seems like a lot of men aren’t even called physically hot and sexy by their own sexual partners, who themselves focus on personality. There’s not much room to fulfill the role of passive sexism object for you partner for many/most men.

I think it is telling that a lot of porn for men ignores the man’s personality and has a woman just throwing themselves at the man, overcome with lust.

Also there the fact that women seem to rarely approach men and some seem to often expect the man to do most of the sexual escalation, especially in the early stages.

We talk about women of color or women who are disabled being sexualized, but we don’t talk about how all straight men are desexualized and denied the ability to be sexualized object.

oh my god... that's why they send dick pics

""witness me!""

---

**thefutureoneandall**

There are occasional reddit threads about things like this: “guys who send unsolicited dick pics, why do you do it?”

The answer always seems to be some combination of slot machine mentality (“maybe this one will like it, and make the other 50 worthwhile”) and a desire for witness. Surprising numbers of people admit that it’s validation even if the reaction is negative, simply because they’re still being viewed in a totally sexual context.

At the very least that has obvious consequences for people trying to reduce dick pic sending. There’s some core of people who can’t possibly be reached with “it’s not attractive to women” because that was never their expectation.

More broadly, I think efforts to get (Western?) men to emphasize with objectification wildly underestimate the challenge they’re facing. It’s not just a sympathy shortage, it’s a totally unfamiliar feeling. Making things even harder, it’s a feeling a lot of men say they wish they could have.

The usual narrative on not (politely) complimenting the appearance of unknown women is “sure, it’s nice if it happens once, but think about how annoyed you’d be if it happened all the time”. Fine in general terms, but I think a lot of men don’t have any way to intuit the emotional difference between too-frequent compliments and being pestered with too much of something totally innocuous like requests for the date.

The comments on those articles are frequently from men saying they’ve literally never received a single compliment from a stranger on their appearance, and can’t imagine what it would be like. The ones who have are often talking about a single, years-old compliment they still cherish. That’s not a framework that supports more than a purely theoretical understanding of what’s it’s like to be valued for your appearance too heavily - or at all.

Obviously that’s not universal, any more than all women are catcalled, but it seems like a really serious communication failure to appeal to a sense of objectification that much of your audience has literally never felt, and desperately wants.

**arjan-de-lumens**

This discussion kind of reminds me of a story that made the rounds about a year ago, where a woman, after having gotten a bit tired with dick pics, decided to try to get her “revenge” of sorts, by sending unsolicited vagina pics to 40 random men:

[*Link to an article on Thrillist, with the title ""We sent a preemptive v pic before dudes could send dick pics heres what happened""*]

> Let’s be honest: while I enjoy penises, I don’t necessarily want unexpected visual boners intruding on my day. I wondered, “What would guys do if I turned the tables and sent them an unexpected vagina pic?” And so, in my own twist on revenge porn, I sent 40 unexpected vagina pics to men on Bumble.

This … didn’t work out the way she apparently expected it to:

> Overall, I was surprised that I didn’t get my, “Gotcha!” moment. I’d initially hoped the guys would see how invasive it is to receive such intimate photos from a stranger. When I’m excited to get to know a guy, his penis isn’t the first part of him that I want to know. But given that men like to send dick pics, I suppose their enthusiasm for v-pics makes sense.

So, basically, women experience dick picks as a net negative, as an intimacy violation, while men experience v-pics as a huge positive, as validation and an indicator of interest.  

This seems consistent with the above discussion, where it’s a pretty common male experience to basically never receive any sexual attention ever and thus respond really strongly positively to whatever scraps come their way (or to start trolling for attention - with the point of some of these dick pics apparently being to get *any attention at all, no matter how hostile*), while a common female experience seems to be more like being flooded with unwanted sexual attention and wanting a way to make it *stop* -  

resulting in an absolutely massive inferential gap - with the result that if you’re on one side of the gap and try to describe your feelings and experiences to the people on the other side, whatever words you have will just fall on deaf ears because the feeling and experiences you describe are … not just unfamiliar, but outright *alien*, to the ones on the other side.

This alienness is … mutual.

So what I’m getting from this…

Is that my idea of taking popular types of fiction and essentially ‘flipping the script’ so that there are sexy male characters as ‘damsel in distress’ types would actually be very good and help a lot of people become comfortable with their sexuality?

---

**jumpingjacktrash**

it could well! i’m not the guy to answer this really, i’m queer and also i’ve always been pretty comfortable with being the one giving the compliments (and just asking for validation when i need it). but i do think there’s a place in the world for fiction where The Sexy One is male.

consider chris hemsworth in ghostbusters. that one’s a bit mean-spirited, with him being hilariously clueless, but you’ve got that dynamic where what he contributes is, he’s hot. that’s it. and i found it kind of a breath of fresh air, not because it was a fuck-you to sexist tropes, but because it’s never, ever enough for a guy to be attractive, but here it was, and that was fun to see. ---

**roachpatrol**

i once thoughtlessly complimented a guy on his jacket, because he and his friend rounded the corner and suddenly i was confronted with an extremely handsome young man in a very fashionable black leather jacket, and i blurted out ‘whoah, nice jacket, you’re looking good!’ and the look on his face was just this *explosion* of surprise and delight– he actually kind of missed a step. the next minute i was like *shit shit SHIT what if things get weird JEEZ* but he and his friend were already walking past, and his friend just started laughing. kind of this ‘whoah, cool, what the hell’ laugh, and when i glanced back they’d both kind of lit up and were elbowing each other as they walked away. i was extremely relieved to have like dodged a bullet of ‘if you let a man know you are attracted to them at close range GOD KNOWS WHAT’S GONNA HAPPEN BUT IT’S GONNA BE OBNOXIOUS PROBABLY’ and then also pleased that i’d made that guy’s day. but also like. i guess now i’m realizing i probably made that guy’s decade…   

i wish it was more common to compliment people– especially guys– in a casual way. but when you live as a woman you can spend a lot more time *dodging* men’s attention rather than soliciting it… 

maybe male poledancing is like, the next big fad to cash in on? guys can enjoy getting hit on and girls can enjoy there being a specific *space* for that, that they, the girls, can leave afterwards."

This is so not true. Now that I’m at a super low body fat (under 10%) and dress really nicely now, I get positive comments all the time, saying I’m sexy, well dressed or just nice looking.

Why should anyone say you look good with a pot belly and clothes that fit poorly or don’t match. You aren’t owed any compliments. Obese women are not getting all these positive comments that you think they do. If you look good, people will tell you.

"Being compassionate and empathetic towards an earlier version of yourself is what you're looking for here. 

What you've done was the best that you were capable of doing at that point in time. You can tell yourself that I could've or should've done XYZ all day, at the end of the day - perhaps you had the skill or the foresight, but you may have not had the emotional regulation skills and knowledge - or the other way around. 

It's easier said than done but it's important that of all people, we speak and handle ourselves with compassion and respect.

Forgiveness is accepting yourself as a flawed human with a flawed past but still seeing yourself as worthy of love and respect. You can forgive other people who have wronged you this way too.

"What's the last kind thing you did for someone? 

It's possible that you don't see yourself as likeable so you're projecting that outwards.

Maybe try doing things that make you feel likeable, ask someone how their life is and then really listen.

Be kind to people without expectation of any return.

And there's a sub category of meditation called 'Metta' or 'Loving Kindness' ... where you practise projecting warmth outwards ... and I can't imagine a person who spends time projecting warmth to other people that is ever unlikeable.

Don't expect a change over night though, people are generally incredibly unobservant of changes in others. 

It should make meeting new people better though.

"I'm not sure how to put this across... I'm feeling really down about everything.. Don't feel like doing ANYTHING.. 

I do workout (I cycle but haven't been going out on rides since the last 7-10 days since I don't feel like it at all) and have an angel of a daughter who's two years old.
However, in spite of these two lovely supports I'm just feeling burnt out, I think..

I have a wife who's supportive on and off depending on her own mental health status.. Financially though, I'm the lone ranger and it just creates a lot of pressure on me..

I can't speak about it with my wife since she ends up feeling guilty about it but doesn't do anything to help - she herself is low on confidence and feels like she cannot land any job with her current skills.

My skills are getting outdated too (Indian IT employee here) but I'm just not up for upskilling myself and the thought of becoming irrelevant kills me.

I want to run away from everything and explore the world but can't do that unless I take care of responsibilities towards family first.

On top of that my parents are financially dependent on me to an extent too and I can't keep supporting them to the level I am doing now with my current income since my child needs schooling and that's a newly added expense column in the monthly budget.

I also do not have any savings whatsoever and the thought of not being financially independent is scary AF.

"Sounds like you are getting burnt out... I'm not a qualified mental health professional so I can't contribute much.. my therapist told me that in order to give, my 'resource tank' needs to be filled. This means engaging in activities that help to 'fill' your tank- things that are enjoyable and meaningful to you. It can be something simple like making coffee or going for a walk in the park while admiring the texture of leaves and flowers. It can be playing with animals. (Personally, activities that don't 'fill' my resource tank for me are mindless scrolling through youtube/reddit, or binge watching Netflix. Instead they increase my stress levels. But some people find these activities restful!)

Another thing my therapist told me is that motivation is a tricky issue because it won't come by 'waiting till you get the motivation again'. Rather, we have to start doing the thing even if we don't feel like it. Then the motivation starts to kick in again. 

Some other tips are journaling (writing down your worries, thoughts etc. Breaking things down step by step), exercising regularly even if you don't feel like it (this is a hard one..). 

Keep going! I hope you can find mental health resources that are accessible to you, like an affordable therapist. The earlier you access help, the better it is. Good job for reaching out here.

"I’m in the same boat. I have my dream
Job, early twenties, I go gym so I’ve built a lot of muscle and strength over the years, I have hobbies and my friends say I’m interesting, funny and nice but for some reason, no woman is interested in me. 

I go on dates and they don’t reciprocate the same energy I give back sadly. Either that or we fuck then they get some other bf or I get ghosted. 

It bothered me and definitely bought some deep rooted issues of not being “good enough” but then I realised you can’t force it. Dating is going to be hellish because that’s what it is.

However I do find that it’s weird because society at large tells women they’re perfect just the way they are but men need to have a shopping list of requirements to even get looked at twice. The dating game is sadly not in our favour because men have to be the good bits of traditional masculinity (provide, protect etc) but also be progressive as heck.

Bottom line is: We should be improving ourselves for our own sake and doing it for women will just lead to disappointment on your part and isn’t fair on them because they don’t have to like anybody they just don’t fancy. Sucks but you know when you have a good one interested because she ACTIVELY shows it.

"Yeah dating can definitely be pretty stressful these days and honestly I see your point in the sense that self improvement in and of itself will not help you find a partner. However, your personal growth along with anything new you learn or acquire will ultimately aid you in your effort to finding someone to be in your life like that.

Dating can definitely be a numbers game and really all we can do is try to do anything we can to increase that quantity to hopefully find the one quality partner we are looking for. Of course there are certain ways or methods to increasing that number in the immediacy but ultimately you will only find more consistent and long term growth when you combine self improvement with it.

I know I kind of fucked this advice up when I was dating but I found it to be kind of helpful to remind myself to take a break from swiping on dating apps whenever I find myself getting too stressed out or burned out from all the rejections and bs I get from getting my hopes up on someone who just turns out to not feel the same way about me. True love is definitely very hard to find and realistically some of us may go through life with multiple partners but find themselves not truly attaining that ideal ""love"" everybody seems to be looking for which ultimately looks like a ""happily ever after"" scenario.

I'd say still try not to give up on those efforts of working on yourself but more importantly find some kind of way to ""treat"" yourself too so you can get yourself to some level of comfort while you're out there living the monotonous tough and lonely single life.

"Basically, you're not doing the right kind of self improvement. It's low-hanging fruit from a mental point of view to fit yourself into the ""man"" cookie cutter, and God knows Jordan B Petersen has made a whole career from telling men how to do it. But gym toning and a decent job don't actually help with dating all that much. For the kind of women who value that, there's always someone fitter, richer, or just possessed of a bigger dick.

What women value varies from woman to woman, but it boils down to ""status"". Again, this doesn't necessarily mean ""rich"" or ""strong"". What constitutes status is subcultural. Some women like musicians. Some women like evidently smart men. Most women see status in men who are nothing more than clearly socially comfortable. You're the king of something, believe me, and there are women out there who will recognise that and value the thing you're king of.

As for what you can do for actual self improvement: true self improvement comes from recognising the ways you self-sabotage and learning not to hold yourself back. Getting out of ruts of negative self image. Doing this creates natural confidence, which in turn creates that sense of status I mentioned earlier.

"I disagree with your title. It's objectively helpful to improve your appearance, self-assuredness, financial status, etc. to boost potential interest, but that doesn't guarantee that you'll be able to capitalize on it. Nothing ""guarantees"" it, only increases the likelihood of success. The key is recognizing suitable opportunities and *capably* cashing in.

What I mean by that is, for example, if you earn more money to increase your attractiveness but aren't good at distinguishing between women with rational financial preferences and gold diggers, your self-improvement might actually make your dating life *worse*. More money, more problems. Same for looks. A short guy who hits a massive growth spurt is going to attract fresh attention, but **it doesn't mean it's the kind he wants.** (That should sound familiar because it's the main issue women encounter.)

Self-improvement forms a nice base. Decent income, decent looks, and a healthy attitude put you on the radar of a much larger chunk of women than not having those things. However, the mindset is an indispensable part, or else you're just blindly battling the odds. Maybe even worse: trying to brute force it with game and pickup lines.

You've done the equivalent of creating a good resume/cover letter and showing up for interviews well dressed. But because you can't nail the interview and get ""the job,"" you've decided self-improvement is ineffective. I realize this sort of initiating in the dating dynamic is something many men loathe, but the alternative of waiting for a woman to do it usually doesn't turn out well.

I can already hear guys asking about men who enter relationships (or at least hookups) without this solid base, often on looks or charisma alone, and saying it's not fair. These represent the lion's share of socially dysfunctional, traumatizing relationships and aren't a model to follow for guys seeking serious relationships.

Sorry that this comment doesn't contain a ton of advice on the actual ""nailing the interview"" part, but I wanted to give some background and respond to the title's claim. Flirting is hard for tons of guys, especially those on the spectrum or with social anxiety. That deserves a post of its own.

About this, though:

>Dating remains an absolute nightmare. Last time I thought a woman was interested in me, she was talking to me for over an hour, gave me her number unprompted, and then ghosted.

You've admitted to being autistic, so I'm going to reiterate something you likely know: sometimes people's actions don't line up with their stated preferences. This doesn't always mean they're trying to pull one over on you. It can be a lack of self awareness.

Without seeing the conversation, we can't really tell what's up. However, this sounds like she wanted an escape route but didn't want to be upfront about it. This is common with people who are conflict-avoidant. It's also not helped by the hyperbolic trope (especially on Reddit) that half of guys will pull out a machete when they get rejected, which encourages this sort of passive behavior.

Finally, quality options are also what makes dating hard, not just the quantity of them. The former is something men and women can commiserate over, even with the massive difference in the latter.

Okay, but being physically healthy, financially secure, engaged in interesting activities, etc can help when you finally are in the right place and the right time.

Right place right time and self-improvement don't have to be a binary. It isn't pick one or the other. It can be both.

 Also, the right place right time idea is something that can also be manipulated and requires some work on your part. I think you're trying to put it all down to luck and suggest that your screwed regardless of what you do. But putting yourself out there is a skill you can develop too.

So you need to develop both, and they are complimentary."		reply	na	na	na	0.9993615746498108	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"Self improvement is not limited to physical and material ideas, self improvement can simply be looking within and discovering what it truly is you want out of a relationship/partner.

Maybe your lack of ""success"" has been you looking for a partner society says you should have based on your looks/health/financial situation, rather than what would actually be complimentary to you and your needs.

The reason this advice is repeated is not because ""my fancy car and my muscular body will bring more perspective partners"", it's because all these activities and improvements lead to CONFIDENCE.  Once you have that confidence (and more importantly, a decent level of self-awareness), all the interactions you have are more open, and more honest both with yourself and others, leading to more possibility of long-term compatibility.

To use an example, you say you have hobbies that people find interesting.  Do you do them because they're hobbies others find interesting? Or because you enjoy them? Further, WHY do you enjoy them (if you do). Further again, are you PASSIONATE about them? Do you drip with enthusiasm when discussing them?  I'm not saying you have to, I'm just saying if you have something that is that important to you, you're more likely to attract people with the same Passion, not just the same Hobby (if that makes sense).  But you don't get to that level of passion if you're choosing things based on looking for a partner, rather than self-improvement.

All of this is to say- the more comfortable you are with yourself, the more attractive you will be to others who are in the ""future partner"" category than the ""hookup"" category."		reply	na	na	na	0.9993615746498108	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

Dude, it’s not just physical. I know tons of women with men who haven’t touched a weight rack. If you stop obsessing about it and working out ONLY to find a girl, you’ll have better luck.

"I'm 33. Make 40k in rural midwest (it's middle of the road income for my area) Long haired, untrimmed beard. 5'11"" 170lbs. I smoke, and toke, and eat garbage, don't workout. My room is a literal basement, but I live with 2 friends (they are brothers, one owns the house) so bills are cheap, we live a pretty decent lifestyle for 3 nerdy bachelors.

I started my self improvement at 26. I'm 7 years in. None of it was motivated by women. I was sick of the guy in the mirror. I was running and swimming consistently for a few years, eventually quit doing both. Got a car after going without for the previous 6 (walked between 2.5 and 3.2 miles to and from work in all 4 seasons for those 6 years...humbling experience for sure)

I started saving money. I put away 8k of my 40k last year, I'm doing good for myself. I give $60/mo to charity,I have since Covid started. I was a 'frontline worker' so covid didn't disruot my life too much. I adopted a shelter animal,I love that dog so much. I buy pizza for my coworkers every single week, and once a month or so will invite them out for breakfast after our shift (we work 3rd shift).

I jump cars in winter, fix flats, give free rides. I listen when people whine about life, I've been told repeatedly over the years that I'm a great leader at my job, I give great advice. I'm pretty tolerant of other's kufestyle choices, even if I disagree (I don't agree with trans stuff but I've been great friends with multiple trans people). ""You respect me, I respect you.""

I try to dress a little nicer, I grew up dirt poor so anything without holes feels luxurious. I already make more than both my parents.

Look, all this is just to say...I've put in a lot of effort o improve my lot in life. I wouldn't attribute any of it to the recent attention I started to garner from women. I can point at one SINGLE thing I did that had the most impact.

I quit trying.

Literally that was it. I'll talk to women, I'll listen to them when they want me to. But I refuse to hang out with women. Period. I'll chill with friend's partners, but no women I don't know through another guy.

I slammed that whole door shut. I've rejected every woman for the past 8 years. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say I'm swimming in female attention, because I'm not.

But when I quit trying or caring about women, they started bringing the effort to me. And I'm loud about it. If you have a boyfriend and you're trying to hang, nope, fuck outta here, go hang with your man. I don't do hugs (this is more specific to a recent lady at work, but no hugs....), in fact, don't touch me unless it's necessary. We are not friends. I'm not interested in being friends. I already have friends.

I openly tell women every fault every previous woman tokd me I had. ""I'm jealous and controlling if you hang out with guys"" ""I've been cheated on by literally every past partner except one and it left me jaded and paranoid about my girl hanging out with dudes"" ""I smoke a pack a day"" ""my room is a disaster, it's embarrassing really""

Major self deprecation. I go full tilt ""I'm a terrible partner don't even bother."" I've taken to calling it pufferfish mode. Complete defense. 

And it's aggravating to no end that soooo many of them (not all, and not even 'most') eat that shit up like they have a cocaine addiction and I'm the only supply in town.

I use to be so nice. Such a gentleman, it got me no where. Young women don't want that. Young women don't even pay attention to men in their 20s. (Again, not all, not even 'most') The number of 20 to 24 year old women who I have suddenly found in my vicinity since turning 30 is fucking astounding. I have no idea what I did, except quit caring and trying.

Aggravating. And I sound like a complete douche when I tyoe this out. I'm really a sweet guy, still kind, I'd give you the shirt off my back to anyone who asked...truly. I just run my mouth a little more than I should, I've been working on that.

thing and another, I’m just not as interested in dating. Hookups sure, I’m definitely not asexual, but dating no. 

I have ADHD so time management is inherently hard for me, plus I’m pretty sure I’m on the autism spectrum. So I’m sure that affects it. It still sucks though.

First i want to say that if this subreddit wasnt the place to say/vent this im sorry, i dont have the most experience on reddit, but because of the nature of my problem and that i cant talk with my father or anyone else about this i choosed this sub, im a 19 year old, and as the title say i feel emasculated because i hate a lot of things about my body and myself, im 5'7 tall, im overweight,i dont have any masculine features like a beard or muscles, i have like a 4-5 inch dick, i haven't had a gf and any experience in love,and i have a horrible self steem,etc (i do have more shit that fucks me up such as ocd but i don't want to make this longer), so, some weeks ago i was considering suicide, but 3 days ago I entered the university degree that I wanted (medicine), so I had a change of mentality, instead of committing suicide, I am going to put aside everything that has to do with love, relationships and everything that I hate about myself , and I was going to concentrate only on my university career, not for myself, but because I believe that instead of committing suicide, I could take advantage of my life and be a doctor to help people and thus be able to be useful and help in something , since if at least I am doomed to be a failure in relationships for all the reasons I said, I think I prefer to ignore all that and find fulfillment and maybe peace with myself by helping others. So whats the point of this post if i already decided what to do, well, i know there are some things that are fixable, such as my weight and my social skills, but i still have problems which have no solutions such as height, ds and overall all the bad thoughts and low self steem, but still i have some hope that if i get advice i could live a better life that is not just focused in just my career and helping others(will do it anyway though, just that i think that living because i love myself would be nice) so that's the reason, i have a little hope that i could get advice i how to get better, because i really dont know how, if you read it all thank you, and again, if this post is out of place im sorry i would have no problem in deleating it, sorry for any mistakes, english is not my first language.

"Hi. I saw the title of your post then read it.  I'm not sure if you're solely venting here & / or seeking some advice. If the latter, I'd first say you're 19, that's young. I lost my v., but barely dated at all until my late 20s. I was broke, then homeless, arrested, then deported from a country, etc. in my 20s which did not help.  You have more than half you life to change your mental, physical, emotional, ...  state.  I can link some resources & advice that I have offered in other threads like the social anxiety one. read dating / relationship advice via Mark Manson &/or Dr. Robert Glover.  also, I can't predict what your dating life will be like, but for me much of it has been ""the juice is not been worth the squeeze.""


1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Exposure Therapy.  CBT type writing or thinking and Exposure Therapy done with a heirachy list on a frequent basis over a long term is the answer.  Dr. Aziz Gazipura's youtube channel &/or his book '..Solution to Social Anxiety' details both very well. Youtube has a wealth of info on doing Exposure Therapy and CBT as well.  Also, the forms from this book, 'Managing Social Anxiety,' are great: https://academic.oup.com/book/28747/chapter/234412205?login=false.


2. Self Esteem.  Improving your overall feelings of self esteem can only positively impact your social confidence.  Check out a book like 'Six Pillars of Self-Esteem' by Nathanial Brandon. Youtube has summaries and the whole audiobook. R. Burns Felling Good as well.


3. Social Skills: besides improving one's cognitive and social confidence, learning actual practical social skills can help. check out a youtube channels like 'Charisma on Command' or Vanessa Van Edwards for practical social skills advice.


4. Attachement theory and Trauma.  CBT writing will help, but understanding and healing any trauma you've experienced and / or knowing your Attachement style can help. Check out, A Secure Base by John Bowlby or Attached by Levine & Heller. Also, Gabor Mate's new book on Trauma.


5. Dating.  there is no shortage of dating advice online, good & bad. the best advice I read was in 'Models' by Mark Manson. also Dr. Robert Glover is a great resource via youtube & his books.

6. Friends.  make a large list of every passion, interest, hobby, etc. you have, have had, or are interested in trying.  then use a combo of searching online, thinking of local businesses, searching meetup. com, fb, ig, etc. for opportunities to engage in that interest in-person or online. then start to regular attend those opportunities. ex: if it's every Wednesday at 7pm then go every Wedn. at 7pm.  You may be uncomfortable, but with frequency comes comfort.

7. Time & Work.  Understand that you will have to dedicate significant work over a long time to change.  You'll have setbacks as well.  Patience and consistency are key in changing your thought and behavior patterns."	GitGud9817	reply	na	na	na	0.009642012417316437	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"First things first. Let's start with your penis. 4-5 inches is a lovely size for any woman but it's also true that being overweight robs a man of some length as the fat pushes out around the penis and stops it extending as far.  


So, believe it or not that's actually something you can do something about.  


Practical advice on that front: any training will do but kettlebell training is the best combination of getting in a hard workout in under 30 mins and improving your metabolism, t-levels and weight loss. Google Pavel Tsatsouli's ""Simple but sinister workout"" and then once you've mastered that search for his ""Right of Passage workout"" - but check out 'Wildman Athletica"" on YouTube for the best guide to form. I swear to you dude if you get to the point that you can do 200 KB swings in 10 minutes  with a 20kg bell followed by Turkish get ups with a 20kg bell  (don't stop there keep on working up to higher weights - start lighter but that should be your first milestone) you'll be fit and strong and you'll be full of confidence walking about campus.  


Eat high protein, low fat and low carbs and the weight will drop off.  


Second thing. It sounds like you know the path forward but you're at that point at the start where the road seems incredibly long and hard and you haven't seen any of the benefits yet.

"First of all, congratulations on successfully getting into medical school. Your English is fine, too.

>well, i know there are some things that are fixable, such as my weight and my social skills, but **i still have problems which have no solutions** such as height, ds and overall all the bad thoughts and low self steem, but still i have some hope that if i get advice i could live a better life that is not just focused in just my career and helping others(will do it anyway though, just that i think that living because i love myself would be nice) so that's the reason, i have a little hope that i could get advice i how to get better

I want to focus on the bold part now. Try not to think of social interactions and relationships as simple equations with unitary solutions. You'll need that mindset in medicine. There are so many obstacles in life that have more than one successful approach. Men are humans, and humans are diverse in both appearance and living situations. There's no single road to manhood that involves growing a beard, becoming muscular, getting a gf at 16 (or something), ascending to a high position in your field by 35, etc.

**You are a man, and no one can take that away.** It's your job to decide what *kind* of man you'll be.

When it comes to relationships, falling outside of someone's preferences doesn't mean your appearance needs fixing. It's impossible to match everyone's preferences. There are partners who won't mind your ""ds"" (and are open to different ways of being pleased anyway), who will be fine with your height, and even those who would be fine with your current weight. If you want to get fitter, it's more sustainable to do it out of your own health goals, not to attract potential a partner.

Any change you want to make will be easier if you can accept who you are now and show appreciation for how far your body and mind have taken you so far, so avoid using others as a benchmark. However, if you find someone who is a genuine source of inspiration, lean into that and accept tips or guidance if they provide it. Even for things like fashion and grooming, there are subreddits here that likely can help.

To ensure your self esteem isn't just tied to work, consider your values and what holds meaning for you. Seek out physical, mental, and social activities that embody those values, that help you develop and refine them. With time, you can build a healthy sense of self, a strong connection to others, and a deep connection to the world around you.

Finally, at 19, you have a long way to go. Go steady and develop life skills.

Do your best, man."	GitGud9817	reply	na	na	na	0.009642012417316437	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"Everything u/hongos_me_gusta has to say is really spot on. Your life isn't over, it's barely started.   


4-5 inches is well within the average for dick size and 5'7"" isn't an undatable height.  


Get away from redpill and blackpill content online. I recommend r/exredpill as a good place to go. Also r/incelexit is a place where men go to talk about their dating issues, their struggles with romance, their desire to have better relationships and other things. It's got good people who have a lot of practice with talking about this stuff and offering advice around what you can do. And this sub is also a good space.   


Deciding to use your life to help others is actually really healthy. It gives your life meaning and value and that can really improve your outlook and how much happiness and joy you're getting out of life. Also, being pro social and generous and compassionate are pretty healthy traits and they will be attractive to women who have pro social values.   


Tiktok isn't the real world. Social media isn't the real world. The women shitposting stuff about how any guy under 6"" can fuck right off, that's not the real world. They don't speak for the majority of women in your country, in the world, in your age group. Don't get it fucked up.  
Try to just focus on meeting people, men and women at your university and getting to know them. Don't worry too much about dating just focus on building up your social skills and your social network. My experience has been that plenty of shy guys have a few ladies that have secret or not so secret crushes on them. I know you think that you have to be alpha chad thundercock to get a girlfriend, but really you mostly just need to be a semi decent human being. Basic self care, basic hygiene, exercising, these can help. No one wants to be around someone who stinks and fat phobia/fat shaming are real things and depending on what country you're in there can be a lot of stigma around being overweight. Walking regularly is great for both your body and mind so you don't necessarily need to hit the gym or lift weights to start improving your health and fitness.   


I want to be clear. Just brushing your hair, teeth, and taking a shower isn't going to get you a girlfriend. But not doing those things will absolutely stop you from getting a girlfriend. Getting to a healthy weight won't get you a girlfriend, but being overweight is bad for your health and your self esteem and low self esteem will hurt your romantic efforts.   


Just going out and socializing and making friends and getting to know people won't get you a girlfriend, but staying in your room all the time being a fucking hermit makes it impossible for people to get to know you. Are you following what I'm saying? Can you track where this is going? There aren't any silver bullets, and there are many things that yeah doing them doesn't guarantee success but not doing them does kinda guarantee failure. You have to start by removing the things that are definitely going to stop you from being happy. Then you have to start adding in things that will help you enjoy your life.   


You don't have to be mentally healthy to get into a relationship, but being mentally healthy makes it easier to enter relationships, it makes it easier to navigate the difficulties of being in a relationship. It makes it easier to be a good partner and to have a healthy relationship that benefits both of you."	GitGud9817	reply	na	na	na	0.009642012417316437	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"A 4-5 inch dick is perfectly normal, and being 5'7"" is totally average. Absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. Feeling ashamed of being average size because you've seen bigger porn stars is like being ashamed of running an 8 minute mile because it's not good enough to qualify for the Olympics.

It's very good that you are focusing all of your time and energy into yourself and building a fulfilling future. That's the single best thing you can do for yourself! You are on the right path to a happy future. 

That all being said, I think you should simply broaden your definition of ""love"" and continue to accept it into your life as you make progress through school. Love isn't restricted to relationships or even friendships. Love can be a complete stranger getting the wrong order at Starbucks and giving it to you to eat and enjoy. Love can be receiving a compliment from someone as you walk to class.

And when someone gives you love, you aren't *expected* to reciprocate it. Merely accepting the gestures with a, ""Thank you, I really appreciate that!"" is enough. 

Being focused on your school while still being open to receiving love from everyone around you will be a very empowering feeling."	GitGud9817	reply	na	na	na	0.009642012417316437	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

> Not great, and still pretty unnerved that a mod muted me for asking about the rules.  

This comment was removed by moderators, and I then posted a fairly long explanation of my feelings about transparency, and included the transcripts of my messages with mods. This was apparently against the rules about criticizing the mods, and I was permanently banned.

If anything, those people showed their true colors in that they are unwilling to engage in a free and open discussion about men's issues let alone any issues in general (since those type of people always have some sort of agenda they must push and anyone who is in the way will be forced out of their way regardless of the ethics or rightness behind it).

"Decided to give it a go since I've never been lonely all my life, (no relationships, virgin etc, full pack lol) (m22).

First three days I decided to be as picky as I am and just swipe right if I truly found that person interesting in any way... got 0 matches.

Yesterday I decided to swipe right a lot more people (Because I thought I may have been shadowbanned or whatever crossed my mind) and I've got like 8 matches in a day but... every women seems uninteresting to say the least...

And now I'm feeling a little bit down because it makes me think that I'll never be able to be with a woman I like and I'll have to decide between a woman I don't find interesting in any way or be lonely the rest of my life...

I feel a bit sad because this feels like I can't have standards if I want to date in any capacity. I'm sure that I prefer to stay single but this event has triggered my feelings"	WorldlinessPlayful72	post	21.540618371958477	male	White	0.998694121837616	na	na	na	5	malementalhealth
You can't judge how interesting someone is based off a couple of lines on a profile. If you met one of them for a coffee or a walk and chatted you may find you really like them. You don't go from 0-100 in relationships from looking at someone's profile. Give people a chance. Go on lots of dates with lots of different women. They may suprise you.

"In a way, that was a hard read dude, but only because of projection.

I’d speculate you may have some self-esteem issues at play here (and as is customary for when I post here, I’m not a professional, and it is always advisable to seek the advice of one).

Tinder, and dating apps is general can be a killer of self-esteem on one side, and encourages your more shallow facets on the other (that’s not a personal dig, everybody is shallow on dating apps; it makes sense in a way, as they’re just catalogues of people really).

Relationships are good fun, and important in life. There’s one that matters above all others though - the relationship you have with yourself. You’re stuck with you 24/7, so get to like who you are; work on becoming the best you possible. Women will notice; and if they don’t, at least you get to spend 24/7 with a dude you respect and admire…"	WorldlinessPlayful72	reply	na	na	na	0.998694121837616	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

Have standards yes, but this shit about ""I want to date in my capacity"" that's a bad way to think about dating. Your girlfriend isn't arm candy to make you look good and signal status to other men, she is a whole ass human being and if you don't want to add value to her life you shouldn't be with her. Same with if she doesn't want to make your life for having her in it she shouldn't be with you. Good relationships are mutually beneficial. Not in a ""men provide protection and resources and women give men sex"" way but in a ""being around this person is awesome and makes my life more enjoyable/happier"" for both of you.

Second. OLD sucks. Tinder is heavily skewed toward men. I'm going to link to you some statistics on this.

Those look like good odds to you? You're find more women of your ""capacity"" (whatever the fuck that means) by engaging in hobbies and building an active and healthy social life where you live than by scrolling tinder. The apps are not made to actually help you find a date. They are made to keep you lonely, scrolling and hopefully eventually desperate enough to shell out cash for ""features"" that will still not help you get a date."

I always try and keep this in mind. I don't have a lot of friends especially guy friends, and we all have wild schedules that don't always line up and I start to feel really lonely in the world.

I am 18 years old and have never had a problem with ED up to this date. I used to master hate and watch porn roughly 3-4 times a week and have had sex with about 7 different women. I also workout about 5 times a week and try to eat healthy but I’m not great at it. I recently got a GF and out first time I did not get an erection( probably due to the fact I jerked off just hours before trying to last longer) then we had sex just fine after that then again we had it fine and recently the ED happened again the only times it seems to happen is when we plan ahead to have sex or it is on my mind. I am a very anxious person and I am worried in bed that I won’t please my gf. When we hangout and we make out and sometimes even when we hold hands I get a boner but when sex comes around I get soft. I do not know what is wrong with me and it is killing me. I think it might be performance anxiety but I am not sure if it is PIED or low testosterone.

"This post screams ""see a doctor!"" 

But if you need strangers on the internet to give you their unqualified opinions...

* SEE A DOC -- and Check your T-levels and as many other blood markers as you can
* Quit porn -- because it causes depression, mostly, but also just generally bad for you in a million social ways that young guys underestimate 
* See a doc
* Talk about it with your gf, because she's already noticed... and she prob thinks its her fault.

"I don't think you have ED. I think you are just anxious. 
You are able to have sex just fine, except when you plan ahead. That says it's psychological.

The best way to shortcircuit the anxiety is just talk to your girlfriend about it or just decide for yourself don't need an erection to hook up. You don't, you can do other stuff in bed that's equally fun for her. 

Stop putting so much pressure on the guy, tell him he can show up when he wants to and you don't need him. And then it'll be ok. 

And overall start thinking about sex less as a performance, more as just playing and having fun. It doesn't have to be so serious."	Perfect-Ad-639	reply	na	na	na	0.997612714767456	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

Anxiety. That’s it mate. Knock off the porn (seriously…it’ll only become a bigger issue later on down the road anyway). Also, tell your girl about your issue and how it makes you feel, that way she can adjust her approach to help you, and also not internalize it (she may think she is the problem).

"It is beyond easy for someone, even those who are well intentioned, to tell a perpetually lonely and insecure guy things like “sex/relationships aren’t everything”, “Just be confident bro”, “work on yourself bro, no one wants to be around someone who’s always negative” or “you need to learn to love yourself bro” when they have been surrounded by positive reinforcement from their peers and close knit friends to boost their confidence and self image since they were children, allowing them to build up their social skills and achieve social success in their childhood and teenage school years. They’ve been able to find friends and playmates on and off their whole lives simply by being themselves, often unimpeded by severe  mental issues or unstable family lives, which is also helped by being conventionally attractive.

These kinds of people often don’t understand what it is like to feel utterly repulsive at your core, to never have any meaningful friendships or relationships in your entire life, to be completely devoid of any external validation or even plagued by outright rejection and bullying, or to have never have experienced human affection your entire life to the point that you believe that there is something fundamentally wrong with you, and that undergoing years of therapy or reinvention just to get yourself to the baseline to even have a chance of finding friends or relationships when they have been doing it since they were 13. It is far easier to have internal validation when you have had it coming from others your whole life and don’t feel as though you have to delude yourself into feeling good about something you’ve never been complimented on. Often, I find that people who preach about loving yourself on your own and the benefits of being single will go on to complain about even the smallest of dry spells.

That’s not to say at all that people like this don’t struggle at all in life or can’t know loneliness. Everyone has their struggles and challenges, some more than others. But to me, someone who has never known a lifetime of loneliness and self hatred lecturing someone who has is like me lecturing a woman on how to deal with the pain of childbirth. Both of us have had our struggles, but not with the same things or to the same extent.

At the end of the day, I feel totally worthless and unlovable. I’ve never so much as held a girl’s hand and I’m still a virgin. It reminds me that I’ve never been good enough for anyone, that nobody has ever willingly chosen me, that who I am is so fundamentally undesirable and repulsive that I’ve missed out on such a basic part of life that **MOST** people get to experience just by existing normally. Eventually my lack of experience is going to leave its mark on me and I will be totally undatable and unlovable. It’s a massive red flag to most people and they will never want to date someone who is outclassed by most people around him.

""Confidence comes from having a track record and a mountain of undeniable proof that you are who you say you are""

This is how I'm living now. I'm building something I'm proud of and I fucking know that at the end of it I'll be able to stand with anyone and feel worthy of love.

This applies to almost every social, economic or health problem. People who haven't struggled with something don't have perspective. So there's very few options for them. You see the same thing, for example, when someone who's never been in poverty tries to tackle that subject. They will come up with some reason the person deserves to be poor and attack them, suggest they just spend less money on frivolous things(because the TV said something about avocado toast), or make an optimistic promise that things will turn up.		reply	na	na	na	0.998674750328064	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
"Yeah, it’s like a rich person saying “money isn’t everything,” or an attractive person saying “looks aren’t everything.”  

I have good self esteem etc. because I know what it’s like to feel wanted. It’s very easy for me to feel like “looks and confidence aren’t everything,” but I can only feel that way *because I don’t lack those things.*  

This society treats ugly and awkward people like garbage. There’s no comfort I can offer, because the reality truly is shitty. All I can say is: I see you, and it’s not all in your head. Don’t let society gaslight you into thinking it’s okay how they treat ugly/awkward people.  

Society subconsciously rationalizes it like “it’s their fault for how they’re treated because they could just be more confident and normal.” Fuck that. If you’re a good person (or try your best to be,) then you’re a god among humans, in my eyes. I know it can seem impossible to gain that kind of perspective from inside a personal hell, but just know that I see your struggle, it sucks, and I’m sorry the world is this way."		reply	na	na	na	0.998674750328064	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"“The idea that it came automatic for them is not only untrue, but it borders on self-pitying.”

They did kind of get it automatically though. They grew up in a healthy environment that gave them plenty of opportunities to develop themselves. They were conventionally attractive, had socially acceptable hobbies, had a consistent support group from their peers and family, and had all the tools to socially prosper. If you miss out on having those or severely fuck it up in your vital formative years, it’s a Mt. Everest level task to actually develop a sense of confidence or security as an adult. 

This is one of my absolute fears, but the idea that you can try getting into socially acceptable hobbies (no nerdy or unpopular things), travelling so you have interesting topics to talk about, working out and taking the best care of your body, going to a therapist to learn how to properly cope, you might even learn how to mimic normal behaviour to the point people treat you as a equal.

But deep inside you, you'll always ressent them, you'll never be normal, because that ""better"" version of you is just a facade that you must make an active, continuous effort to maintain, while most other has everything you had to work for years granted by default simply by being themselves, and the moment you decide to be more genuine, to ""be yourself"", you will once again be left to rot all alone.

If you never had external validation in the most important years of your social development (childhood, teens, and twenties), the real you will forever be insecure, distant, distrustful and emotionally unavailable, no matter how much effort you put in improving yourself. **I won’t stop trying to move forward or make improvements where possible**, but you must realize how embarrassing and unflattering it is to have to spend the entirety of your youth you could have spent making friends and relationships having to totally reinvent yourself just to even have a chance of doing something that literal children and teens can do"		follow-up	na	na	na	0.998674750328064	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"Hard disagree.  These are the *best* people to get advice from.  The key caveat is empathy.  If they haven't taken the time to understand what other people go through, then yeah, their advice won't resonate and won't be particularly effective because it's usually off-center.  They'll misattribute reasons for their success.  They'll fail to acknowledge certain factors that helped them or hindered others.

But assuming they've taken the time to really understand human behavior and interaction, and to acknowledge that not everyone's situation is like theirs, they can be an absolutely wonderful source of knowledge, experience and advice.

The thing is, most people don't take the time to do that - whether they're confident or not.

As I read your post, the common denominator I'm seeing in all your complaints about these hypothetical people is a lack of empathy on their part.  That's not unique to this situation though.  People without empathy tend to suck in all manners of ways, whether they're confident or not.

Suffering is universal.  The idea that anyone doesn't suffer, that anyone doesn't struggle with insecurities, is naive and borders on self-pitying - ""No one understands my struggles!""  Yes, yes, they do.  Because everyone has them.  They vary in circumstances and severity of course, but everyone has struggles.  They may not understand the minutiae of your specific circumstances, but they understand suffering and coping.  Many of those ""carefree"" people (which is an absurd term to begin with - no one's carefree) have structured their life, behavior and surroundings in a way to contribute towards that result.

From reading your post, it sounds like you're caught in a severe shame spiral.  Snapping out of those doesn't happen quickly.  It can take years of concerted effort to start bearing fruit.  But that's what it's gonna take:  concerted effort.  Find a good therapist.  Find triggers in your life - things that make you feel worthless, bad about yourself, etc.  See if you can made adjustments to avoid some of those triggers.  Do you have a toxic relationship with someone in your life that makes you feel badly?  Distance yourself from that person.  Are you dissatisfied with some circumstance in your life?  See if you can change it -- or if not, see if you can change your perspective on it and accept it.  Dive into behavioral studies and research.  For example, read books or listen to podcasts/interviews from folks like Brene Brown.  If you're going to cope with and improve your mental and emotional state, you have to be able to understand it.   

An awesome anecdote from Brene Brown:  In the course of their research, they asked participants to name as many emotions as they could.  The average result was three:  happy, mad, sad.     So these folks, when they were experiencing emotions, basically had to shoehorn everything they were feeling into either happy, mad or sad -- because they didn't have the vocabulary to communicate or identify other emotions.  What about regret, wonder, shame, pity, anguish, contentment, tranquility, contempt, etc.?  Without the words to navigate these emotions, how can we possibly confront and cope with them?

For a lot of people that seem ""carefree"" it's because they have an intuitive understanding of one or more of these things, and they took actions in accord with that.  The idea that it came ""automatic"" for them is not only untrue, but it borders on self-pitying - because it paints this notion that there's something fundamentally different about us on an innate level that prevents us from being like that.  There's not.  The struggle isn't equal for everyone, but the same opportunities are there."		reply	na	na	na	0.998674750328064	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"Yeah the thing is no one has it that easy. Your post shows that you don’t have empathy or compassion or an effective means to consider “the other.” Everyone has struggles. Even those you deem to be “perfect.” Some have more than others. So how do we quantify which struggle means more? We can’t. Because as humans we can only see our own struggle perfectly. So that leaves two alternatives. 

1) never give advice to others because our struggle is not exactly the same as theirs

2) give advice the best we can knowing that our experiences are all different but may be similar enough to help each other

So there you have it. Your thinking leads to those alternatives only. So no point in posting anything here."		reply	na	na	na	0.998674750328064	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
OP I agree with what you wrote because I'm in a similar situation.  I can't disagree with your struggle and the thoughts you've said because they aren't wrong.  You don't know what the taste of success is because you haven't tasted much of it and so you feel you have no chance but it's only because you haven't known success just yet. Perspective defines what you taste as success more than anything.  6 months ago I had only been on one date in my entire life and had virtually no romantic escalation with anyone.  And now I can say I've been on 5 dates with 5 different people.  Just stop and think about that for a second as a turning point.  It's not the ultimate goal I have but it indicates progress.  And progress takes many shapes and forms.  The big picture is you want a relationship but what about all of the smaller steps in between?  An MLB player doesn't get to be an MLB player without the minor leagues.  And that could be a series of really small steps, like I made eye contact with the attractive lady on the elevator.  Or I did a 30 minute workout.  Or I joined a club and went there and talked to people.  If you reframe success into a series of smaller more manageable accomplishments your goal won't seem so unachievable.  But it takes a lot of steps and trial and error to find someone who you like and who likes you back.  You made a comment about climbing everest.  How close are you to base camp right now?  What can you do to get to 1,000 feet, then 5,000 ft, then base camp, then the rest of the way?  And the other aspect about it is failing in certain steps or getting an unexpected result is actually progress if you frame it in a different mindset.  I've got a very long way to go in my climb at 35 I've never kissed anyone or been intimate with them.  But I recognize that although it's difficult I've made progress.

"Ok. So, empathy hat on.   


That advice, about confidence, about working on yourself, about your value and self worth being intrinsic qualities that others cannot and actually will not give to you? That shit is valid. And it's not just people who have lived on easy street who will tell you that. Learning to love yourself as an adult, as a neurodivergent person, as someone with trauma or mental health or physical health issues. As someone who faced adversity and chaos in their childhood. It's fucking hard. It is fucking hard. It's still the truth.   


It sounds like you're struggling with shame. In truth I didn't read your full post at first. The first paragraph and the title full on pissed me off.   


You don't mention how old you are, just that you are worried about your lack of experience leaving some indelible mark on you. It won't. Virginity isn't a personality trait. Like, having sex doesn't fundamentally change you. I see a lot of virgins who seem to think that if they have sex they'll have some trophy to put on the wisdom mantle, some achievement will unlock a costume or badge will unlock and they can display it to others. You know I've met grown ass people who were virgins and I didn't find out until we were about to have sex and they were like ""I'm a bit nervous, I've never done this before"" It doesn't leave a stain, it doesn't leave a scarlet letter on your soul or your psyche. I get that there is a lot of virgin shaming, of weirdness of bullshit in the world, and that sucks and it's stupid and harmful. I hate virgin shaming as much as I hate slut shaming. Both are about controlling other people's access to their own bodies and sexuality.   


You aren't lesser for being a virgin and it won't ruin you. Your value as a person isn't going to run out. Your belief that others are fundamentally more human than you are is actually much more harmful to you than your virginity ever could be. I'm not saying that your loneliness isn't genuine and valid, it is and it is clearly painful and there is nothing wrong with wanting to have the connection and intimacy and warmth of a romantic relationship. There's nothing wrong with wanting to feel desired by another and to share and give and receive pleasure. That's all normal and valid.   


Tying your self worth to a relationship is pretty detrimental to your personal well being though, it also tends to interfere with your ability to enter into and to enjoy a relationship. Desperation is a turn off to healthy people and attractive to toxic people. So it's very much a sword with no hilt, it cuts you no matter how you try to hold it.   


The narrative of ""I'll love me when someone else loves me"" is neither correct, nor sustainable nor healthy. It puts your own love of yourself, your own self worth and self love conditional upon someone else. It means your ability to actually love yourself to value yourself is always at the whim of another, it is forever beyond your control. This is so amazingly unhealthy. I know that this belief is learned in childhood, it's given to us by culture, by our parents by our circumstances growing up. Circumstances we do not at all control or choose. I know that unlearning is hard and invisible work and that it is painful and difficult. But unlearn you must. If your sense of self is tied up in others then it can never be your own, it will always be beyond your actual control. You will never own yourself, you will never have security or confidence when your actual value is determined by what others think of you.   


The solution is to change your value system, to value yourself according to your adherence to principles and values. When people say ""work on you"" they mean ""work on becoming a person you can love intrinsically."" This is easier said than done, but no one said it would be easy or simple.   


For what it's worth, I'm sorry for my earlier posts in which I failed to read all your words and reacted quite harshly to what I did read.  


For what it's worth, I wish you the best.

Sure, sex is probably cool, but there's so much else in life you can do. If you worry so much about having a relationship, chances are you'll screw yourself out of one. You have worth, regardless of whether you've been in a relationship or not.

"I think you're letting your anxiety get to you. College IS hard, but that doesn't mean you can't get through it. I think testing the waters with one class is a great idea (keep in mind as well, though, that sometimes we have a smaller workload, find that it fills our time ... then increase our workload and somehow still manage to make time for it. I think a lot of people kind of just expand how they use their time to fit how much time they have, if that makes sense lol ... have found this with work. having more days off doesn't necessarily mean I accomplish more things outside of work)

what are your goals in doing this? why would there not be second chances? why would it matter if you can't finish the class? btw keep in mind that generally classes will give you some time in the first few weeks to abandon ship without it affecting your grades/finances

also if you have diagnosable mental issues that are causing problems for you, consider talking to the school's disability services to see if they can make adjustments for you (for example, giving you longer to complete tests). it's worth talking to someone even if you're not sure that it will work out

in any case that's probably the most important advice for anything.

"I am a newly wed in my mid-thirties and have been with my wife for 7 years. The older I get, the more I realize I have some toxic personality traits I need to change. Just typing that is hard to do because I don't think of myself as a toxic person, but I guess that's classic denial, right? I think of myself as a mostly level-headed person who is loving and supportive but if I stop and really examine who I am, I see that isn't the full picture. I have a problem with my ego. I mistakenly view myself as the ""man of the house"" or ""head of the household"", which I know is wrong, patriarchal and outdated. This is probably because I grew up during a time where this was more common and saw it during my own upbringing. 

I can often be argumentative, confrontational and like to be right all the time. Being in an argument with me can feel like being interrogated because I argue indefatigably. I am quick to anger over trivial issues and just as quick to (mis)place blame. I say condescending and hurtful things which I apologize for later but the apologies ring more hollow as time goes on because my behavior doesn't change. My wife is smart, patient, forgiving and rarely gets angry. She takes good care of herself mentally and physically and has much better control over her emotions than I do. I'm not all bad, but this post isn't for me to defend myself. It is to acknowledge that despite the things I do right, I am doing many other things wrong, and they are unfair to the person I love the most. So I'm asking for your insight. Have you or a significant other overcome this kind of behavior? How? Transcendental meditation? Therapy? Medication? Exercise? A self-help book? I am open to all suggestions and perspectives.

"Most people would recommend you to try therapy but what you should take into consideration is that you can also work on yourself to be a better husband. Insight is key.

I may be wrong but you sound like you have narcissistic traits, you may want to delve into it.

First of all, communication is key. You may want to talk to your wife about her opinion about your traits.

About what you have posted.

First of all, you may want to take into consideration who you are talking to, it's not the same to argue with an stranger than with your wife. Whenever you are arguing with your wife and you feel like you are right and she is wrong you should:

&#x200B;

1. Take a second to breath and remember that she is your wife, she loves you and she is with you for a reason and that should be your focus, not a stupid argument about whatever.
2. Everyone NEEDS to experience failure. Even if your wife is completely wrong you may want to roll with it and support her whenever she fails and remember that every failure makes her grow as a person. This is the equivalent of being an helicopter parent, you NEED to let children experience failure.
3. As I said, whenever you argue with her first remember that you love her and she loves you so approach her calmly as there's no need to be angry.

&#x200B;

Another exercise you want to do about yourself to challenge your own view is remember how many times you have done something wrong.

One mistake I often see is that people think ""Oh but I had good intentions"" or whatever. Whenever you have made your wife feel bad, cry or whatever you have done something wrong and I don't fucking care about your intentions.

Everyone is susceptible to failure and to do bad things and that doesn't make people Bad people. doing bad things make us... humans.

So you need to acknowledge that

Everyone is susceptible to be wrong and to fail, including you and that doesn't make you less of a person.

Your wife loves you and you love her too.

"First of all, we all make mistakes sometimes and can get caught up in arguments, but it's really admirable how you acknowledge some areas you want to work on! 
Learning about the ""four horsemen"" helped me a lot, and I've copy-pasted from my notes about it here:
 
(1) blaming; 

(2) defensiveness; 

(3) contempt; and 

(4) stonewalling.


(1)    Blaming/Criticism:   
If catch yourself going into blaming mode, try using “I feel” language, instead of “You did this, you did that.”  Make sure you complain about the behavior, not the person.   
Make a request. (“I would like…”)

(2)    Defensiveness:  
Usually this happens when someone is not feeling heard.  If you feel defensive, ask them what they heard you say. (“I want to be sure we are on the same page.  What are you are hearing me say?”)

(3)    Contempt: (sarcasm, belittling, cynicism, hostile humor).  This is the most poisonous of the Horsemen because it conveys disgust and condescension.  It attacks the person.  If you are feeling contemptuous, use “I feel… I want…” language.  Name your emotion.  Seek to understand the other person’s viewpoint.   Acknowledge it (you don’t have to agree with it).

(4)    Stonewalling: (tuning out, cutting off communication).  If you feel flooded or fear speaking, breathe.  Get centered.  Ask to create safety conditions so you can speak directly.  (“I need to say something, and I feel like I can’t.  What I need is…”)

The idea is to get enough time between the event and our response to deflect a triggered, toxic state.  This way, we can avoid the hurtful things we say or do.  We take responsibility for our communication as best we can.

"awww congrats on your marriage :) !

I think the fact that you're trying to be self-aware is an incredibly important step here.

frankly this sounds like my partner and me, except I'm in your position (minus the gendered ideas). it's really hard to temper yourself, for sure. some things that have helped me are, when I'm arguing about something that bothers me, to try to keep it centered on myself. How do I feel; what I am perceiving; what do I feel like I need? (as opposed to ""you are xyz, and you are doing abc, and why can't you jklmnop???!?!!"" because that stuff is often not a full or fair picture, and it is hurtful)

Try really hard to avoid big generalizations like ""you always/you never,"" that kind of shit is catastrophic for a difficult conversation.

Try really hard to remind yourself that even if you really care about a topic at the moment, it's ok to take a break and put it down til later, it's not going anywhere.

even more importantly, start to condition yourself to pay attention to the little signs in your body that tell you you're getting stressed. it's important to be able to notice when you are escalating, something that is not always obvious. it's really fucking hard too, when you feel right, to be able to say to yourself ""I'm being a bit over the top here"".

if you're anything like me, you start to get really animated and feel excited when you're arguing a point. remember that EXCITEMENT IS ONE SIDE OF THE COIN; THE OTHER IS AGGRESSION lol. excitement can easily become overexcitement which can easily became irritation which can easily become anger, if there is a disagreement. if your wife points out to you that you're escalating .. BELIEVE HER lol. even if you feel like you're just excited (it's kind of like when someone is having a really good time and doesn't realize that they've started talking really loud and then just outright yelling xD).

another point on top of this that I find really fascinating that I've witnessed in people with this same thing. I knew someone who would get in arguments and their pets would run away to avoid the conflict. then at other times they'd smoke weed and chill out, and even if they were talking about a difficult topic, even if they escalated ... it wasn't the same. it didn't scare the pets away. what was the difference? something about their internal approach -- part of it was, I think, their greater ability not to react immediately but just to wait. that is REALLY important. TRY NOT TO REACT RIGHT AWAY. TAKE TIME TO BREATHE, AND THINK!

also practice saying sorry for the little unfounded irritations too, to work on humbling yourself. remember that saying sorry doesn't mean ""you're 100% right and I'm 100% a piece of worthless chewing gum on the ground"" ... it just means ""I recognize I did something wrong here, and I own up to that part."" even if the other person did wrong, you can still recognize your part in a conflict.

there are probably a million other things. maybe you and your wife can sit down and try to make a list of things to work on in conflicts ... and things that you already do well, to get better at!!"	ThrowRA0182716555219	reply	na	na	na	0.3372047245502472	weak	strong	no	na	malementalhealth
I definitely suggest therapy. It’s great that you are aware there is a problem because it is the first step & in changing your behavior. Therapy is the way to go and the next step in making a change. Therapy will help you understand why you behave the way you do. Even if you think you already know why there is much to gain from finding a deeper understanding. Then therapy will give you tools needed so that you can actually take action & change the behavior. Therapy as an adult changed my life. I think it can be beneficial to everyone If they are open to it & can find a good therapist. I highly suggest you try it.

"Hi I’m a 20m and I honestly don’t know what’s going on. My whole life I’ve been a very social person. Through playing sports I’ve always had lots of friends and have always been in the more popular circles my whole life. Through high school I was partying every weekend all weekend, and had no issues talking to people wether male or female. I went to college for a semester and was in a fraternity and had no issues there either. But when I dropped out and moved back home and started working things have been different. I struggle to start conversations with people out of straight nervousness and if a conversation starts it’s difficult for me to keep it rolling. If it’s a female it becomes twice as hard. I talked to bunch of girls in high school and college but once the talking started to get serious and moving towards some type of a relationship I would get so nervous to the point I was terrified of making the wrong move so I wouldn’t make a move at all. Some times I get so angry that I’ve never had a girlfriend and it seems that nobody has any interest in me in that sense. I’ve tried dating apps and have gotten 0 results and have gone crazy thinking I was setting my standards too high and still no results. Now it’s too the point where I only have two friends I talk to on a daily basis and it has been so long since I’ve had a girl that’s just a friend to me.

"Hope writing this and posting it made you feel little better. 

Dropping out and moving back home are big changes. Allow yourself time to adjust to fact that things are going to be different as your peer group are at different tangent than yours. At your age familiarity breeds trust that leading up to relationships. Now that you are out of it things may appear different.

Firstly take a breath. This is a minor set back which commonly happens to everyone at some stage of their life. You are not alone.

Do you have support system. Who in the current timeline makes you feel loved and valued. Spend some time with them. Spend time in a place where you feel sense of belonging. 

What is going on your head when you get nervous? Sometimes we suffer more in our head than in real life. Our thoughts are not facts but learned pattern of responses.

"Lately I've been seeing a lot of stuff online about ketamine treatment, and also heard some positive reviews from friends. I'm wondering if anybody here has tried it. What was your experience? 

I had two friends who talked about how amazing it was for rewiring their brains to have a more positive outlook and see through a lot of C-PTSD that's been holding them back for years. 

I also have another friend that goes semi-regularly but doesn't seem to be incurring much in the way of positive results. 

I'm very curious to try it but the price tag is expensive so I'm looking to get as many perspectives as possible.

The pathway to get out of the hole begins on yourself by yourself, forget about the rest of people, this is you on your own privacy with yourself, you want to find to desire for life by yourself, regardless of what the entire world thinks or cares about you, lose weight for yourself, to show yourself how much you care about yourself in your own privacy.  
If you manage to love yourself and enjoy life by yourself regardles of what any other human being thinks or feels or does for you, then paradoxicaly, people will start expressing the love you want towards you, because you will irradiate positive vibes coming from your own love for yourself.

"This is start of the rest of your life. I felt very down during the separation and divorce. I felt like my life was going to be misery and I was going to be made to pay for the rest of my life. I thought that everyone I knew wasn't going to believe what had really happened. My ex was not well mentally and she continues to be hard to deal with.

But then I had nothing less than a secular epiphany. I realised that I cannot change who she is. I cannot change what she does and she, and her family will always be this way. You cannot hold yourself responsible for how she is behaving. What you must do is conduct yourself in integrity with yourself and your values. Once I realised that as long as I behave in a way that I can keep my head up and live in dignity and pride, she can do whatever. And does. I put my children first. And you've already identified that they're important to you. That's because they're a child. Children are innocents and have to be protected and supported.

In a way, the hardest part is over. I don't know why you divorced, but I saw it as getting rid of the thing that prevented me from saying the things that needed to be said and being able to enforce what I saw as things that needed to change. It's a business partnership now more than anything else. And that has legal backing. In many ways more simple than a marriage. Yes it's work, but so is marriage. All the hidden land mines and trip wires are gone and you can come to an agreement with your ex. Complain when she doesn't live up to her end. The whole bit.

"(Long ramble)

I care. I have so many emotions that it hurts. I feel my stomach sink when I see something nostalgic or shocking. I cry when I see a hurt animal or sad movie. I get scared when I'm alone in a strange place. I get mad when my friends and family are mistreated. I get sick at the sight of blood. I get jealous when someone gets better things. But nobody wants to hear it.

Whenever I open up to people they push it off. Everyone has a place they would rather be. I cant blame them though, I'd complain all day if given the chance. I'm young, inexperienced, and ignorant, but if I'm never thought I'll never be then man I want to be. The man I need to be. I know I'm not a man, I'm the first one to admit that.

I'm told that if the problem doesn't hurt me or I cant control then I shouldn't care. But if nobody cares the problem never gets better. Why should I care about Ukrainian, that starving kid in a poor neighborhood, those dying of cancer before they could live. I do anyway. Were living in a mass extinction event and the world is a mess. Everyone has something else to worry about but me. It seems I just cry alone since I'm crying over nothing. 

One man can change the world, but I know that man isn't me. But I'll still bleed my heart out for everyone even if I shouldn't. Maybe I'm an idiot, or a pussy, but I want this place to feel like home. Like someone gives a shit. That somebody is happy when they meet me rather than just waiting for their time to go.

It can be a long process of building relationships with people and building your self esteem.  If you are on the spectrum like I am you have to learn human behavior and get comfortable with something that isn't as natural.  What I think I do as being cool and nice some might see as being a little off.  And that can be enough to make people shy away.  But it's something you can change.  You have to build up friendships with people and be social, ask a few people out, learn to gracefully accept rejection, and move on.

"Look. Here's the situation. Mindfulness mediation is about first of all removing the control your emotions and thoughts have over your actions words and happiness. It is then about improving your ability to concentrate and pay attention to different aspects of reality and your mind until you are able to remove your ego from experience.  


I've been doing it on and off for a decade now and it has saved me from PTSD, depression , anxiety and helped me tackle the symptoms of my ADHD and be productive.  


Meditation get's a bad rep because it's practiced by leftie idiots and women who want to rearrange your chakras ... but that's all just so much BS and so far removed from mindfulness meditation which requires rigour and discipline and consistency and dedication.  


I've found the best proponent and person who explains it best is Sam Harris on his Waking Up app.  


The headline cost is like 149 a year but there's a cheaper option at 49 per year and if you can't afford that then he's made a commitment to never let money be a barrier to the app so you can just email and say that you can't afford it right now and he'll send you a years free subscription.

"For a long time now I've had a few issues, housing (now thankfully sorted temporarily), hunger, illness and disability stopping me from working and more.

I've had enough.

I've had to think about this, long and hard, but the decision I've made is that suicide is the one and only option and solution that makes any sense.

I'm hungry 99% of the time due to a lack of income, that genuine hunger pain. I'm losing weight, my friends and family are just gone. I'm lonely so there's no help. When I do eat I can't enjoy it, wondering when I will next actually be able to.

So today I have found some strong paracord and I intend to make sure I no longer have to deal with this. That tonight I'm not worried about food, or that in a few months I'm wondering about having shelter again, or how I pay my rent with no/little income (I recently got awarded a meager disability sum starting February 15th).

It shall pass too. Everything seems beautiful from the outside. Common depressed people will always recommend you to get married or go in relationship, but that is not an actual solution because even there it's about chance because you actually don't know for sure that you'll find what you are looking for and you cannot expect some stranger to take all your burden because they themselves would be weak and looking for support. I think you might have anxiety issues. I'd recommend find a good therapist immediately he'll be able to tell what more is going on under the hood. Along with that you have to start volunteering work, which won't cost you a single penny but you'll gain a lot by way of giving.

"I can relate to this. Hang in there! nothing lasts and this will pass ,keep telling yourself that in the really hard painful times. Your not alone and everyone goes through some kind of pain and suffering in life, in fact suffering is a guarantee in life but the challenge is to rise above it. Its not about fighting the darkness but acceping yourself as you are and changing your perspective on things. Try not to chase happiness but accept this present moment as it unfolds before you. Everyday find at least 3 things your greatful for and speak them out to yourself, they can be simple and whatever you like, shift your perspective. If your best friend were going through what you are what would you say to them to help them? and say that to yourself as if you were your best friend that helps a lot. Also it's really really important to find meaning in life like something your passionate about and pursue that and set small goals for yourself towards that. 
And lastly a prayer that really helps me is the serenity prayer, it goes like this....
""God grant me the serenity to ACCEPT the things I can't change, the COURAGE to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.
It helps a lot to surrender over things that you can't change and think about the things you can change.

You seem a bit ashamed of accepting your mother's help (something I've done many times). But the secret is that almost everyone who is living that ""good life"" has it because of generational wealth. They're not all dilettante trust fund slackers, but they had moments of financial support when they needed it: to relocate for an opportunity, to be unemployed for a while while they studied or trained, to start a new business (or six).

That's fucking unfair, which maybe isn't the positive message you need. But it's not your personal failure, it's built into society. *For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.*

"By almost every metric men as a demographic are being failed by western society. More men in prison, more men are homeless, more men die in workplace accidents, no legal protection for male genital mutilation, longer prison sentences for the same crime, less men succeeding in education etc etc.

Then a guy comes along who superficially appears successful (health, wealth) and people are predisposed to listen to him because maybe he knows something they don't.

Then he starts talking about all these problems men face, that seemingly very few people even acknowledge as issues and tells you he has the answer. All you have to do is pay a bit of money.

Once you've paid that money changing your mind becomes difficult - it's harder to convince a person that they've been scammed than to scam them in the first place, because if they've been scammed it means they're gullible/vulnerable and are ashamed. Naturally they want to preserve their ego.

People who are struggling are also tired of being told that they're responsible for things they have no control over. It's not your fault that 300 miles away another man is a nutcase who beats his wife. Men aren't this monolithic figure responsible for every other man in the world, despite what current sentiment seems to be.

So when a guy comes along and says something like ""you're only responsible for yourself and no one else"" it's an appealing alternative. Truth is somewhere in the middle.

I'm not a fan of Andrew Tate, I think he's not as smart as he thinks he is, is crass, loud and violent and has limited understanding about how the world works. But he knows how to run an MLM/scam.

"Here’s how I’ve come to understand it.

In the last decade or so, it has become quite apparent that there is a decline for support with men. Weather you believe this or not is irrelevant, because for a large portion of men they feel left behind.
They look for leaders who tell them it’s ok to be men, to not cower behind some mask to be afraid to show “toxic masculinity”.

The truth is, many men feel offended because they feel like their masculinity is under attack, and in some aspects it is. So men particularly younger ones are looking for a leader to show them what it means to be a man.

EDIT: not a supporter of Andrew tate, just explaining why I think people follow him. I’d also like to add that there isn’t anything inherently toxic about masculinity, because there is no clear definition. Masculinity describes what men do, not how we should act. We shouldn’t be asking ourselves how to be more masculine, we should be asking ourselves how to be the best men we can be."		reply	na	na	na	0.9993195533752441	no	strong	no	na	malementalhealth

"Psychology is fractal and the psychology of society reflects the psychology of the individuals that comprises that society. And importantly the psyche always seeks balance and wholeness

Right now, the popularity of Andrew tate and others like him are mass psychological reactions to the growth of an overwhelming feminine ethos in western culture which has in sense suppressed the masculine insticts within men. Now like the homophobic Baptist minister who's repressed his sexuality, masculinity doesn't just go away because you purposely suppress it, it just comes out in ways (often destructive) that can't be anticipated. In the case of the pastor it may present in the form of strange sexual fetishes or even sexual assaulting. With our culture it's manifesting in part in the form of antisocial masculine roll models who play off the sexual frustration and general nihilism of young men. For the first time a man has come along and validated frustrated men's feelings and given them an ideal to strive towards. 

In rough jungian terms, Andrew tate is a manifestation of the collective unconscious's masculine instincts and drives. He's become the father who will one day pass the torch off to his son.

Not so long ago an Australian school decided that all the boys should stand and apologize in general assembly, and what were they apologizing for? Well their own existence.

I do hope people can start to recognize what a fucked up idea this is, and how this discrimination will affect kids in their formative years, how it might even break them.

This stuff leads people to develop worthlessness issues, anger toward those who make them feel this way, which keeps growing into resentment and hate.

"Here's my take on that- A lot of people are collectively fed up and are thankful that there's someone in his position speaking up. 

With the declining support for men and the disparaging of men/masculinity he is one of the figures that speaks out against the narrative of less masculine = better human. I believe that's the biggest main reason why he has the influence that he does right now, and many people find his motivational content inspiring as well.

I won't deny that there are some things he says are dumb/exaggerated which I take with a grain of salt. But many of the things he says are valid. 

I don't mind if you dislike him but something I'll criticize is that I think you are for sure feeding into some of the lies from media like him being a rapist for example. Of course, if he's innocent of what he's being held for then he should be released.

I think it’s because other male spaces have probably been ridiculed by feminists (Reddit is a good example) so if anything Andrew Tate was just the boiling point. If there’s no positive spaces for young men can seek guidance then of course there’s just gonna be the bad spaces left. I may not agree with most of what he says but you can’t deny the fact that a lot of men unironically have better themselves from him. I’m not talking about the ones who become sexist, mainly the ones that stop feeling sad for themselves and start bettering themselves in life.		reply	na	na	na	0.9993195533752441	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
">depression isn't real and people just need to pull their life together

I wouldn't go so far as to say it's completely fake, but if your life is objectively bad; you're poor, alone, out-of-shape, messed up sleep schedule, etc. it makes sense you will feel down.  That doesn't mean you need therapy or SSRI's, it means you need to fix your life.

>How can you justify a rapist as a good person?

He's only been accused.  Innocent until proven guilty.  I'm not going to assume he's a rapist just because someone accused him.

Honestly, I don't even like him.  I agree he's an asshole, and his ""Hustler's University"" is a giant scam, but that doesn't mean he's the personification of evil."		reply	na	na	na	0.9993195533752441	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth

I got into an argument with my cousin the other day while I was helping my uncle out at his catering company. He started grilling me on my plans for grad school and how I was going to support myself and where I was going to live and blah blah blah. For context, my parents are moving to another state, and I don't want to come with them because a) I'm fucking sick of them and b) if I decide to start a new life, I don't want to have to do it one of the most expensive states in the country. He just kept poking holes in all my ideas without offering any viable alternatives. I finally snapped and told him I was going to drink myself to death on Valentine's day so it didn't matter anyway. Then he had the nerve to start pushing hopium at me and telling me that he would be devastated if I went through with it. But I don't care anymore. Everyone ignored me until it was too late. Why should I give a shit how they're going to feel about me quitting early? On the other hand, I could just keep living the C- lifestyle until I die, but I'd probably gradually lose all of my friends and die without ever experiencing love. On the bright side, at least that would probably kill me faster.		post	11.408002426492612	male	White	0.9987174272537231	na	na	na	8	malementalhealth
"In the past I’ve had decent results from “Checkpointing” my life story. By this I mean that when I get low enough I start thinking continuing is pointless, I let curiosity about the future win. For me absurdism is a rope I can climb to get away from nihilism.

For me anger helps as I contemplate the cases I know of acquaintances over the years… The people they wanted to hurt really weren’t hurt at all. I surrender to the fact that the people I want to feel punished by my sad life at that time will probably not be punished to my satisfaction by guilt because they’ll blame me, and instead I’m probably just going to make at least a few decent acquaintances very sad at least temporarily if they get the news that I died so low.

Eventually (so far) I being myself to the realization that, if for no other reason than spite, my life matters at least a bit to me. If for no other reason than the possibility of eventually seeing what kind of train wrecks the lives of these people are going to be as they continue living with their defects. The world is hard, and if wise people say existence is suffering I can trust in time that if I suffer my own existence a bit longer, then I can at least get a smirk in the future when some asshole inevitably suffers for their un corrected defect of character in a way that leads to an interesting enough story to reach me.

Then I decide my life’s not the problem but anything I have in my life potentially could be a grave problem. So I just reset and restart trying to do shit right this time. At different times I have lost enough body weight to cure my obesity, quit drinking and retreated from my friends circle because it was centered on drinking…. 

One time I decided I needed to set up an elaborate disappearing act involving a popular seasonally touristy nature attraction in the off season, but I ended up overpowered by the natural beauty of the world and smoked weed around some cool nature animals until the return ticket I bought needed to be used because I failed to find a practical way to go missing. So I went home and changed everything about my life…

Shit sucked for a long time after that, but why not change absolutely everything? I remind myself how desperate I had gotten doing the things that made up the activity of my life, and I assumed the safest thing to do was change everything.

I hope this method keeps working for me. I have done a major turn around in how I view my health after realizing that if I take care of myself well, I can see the ravages of age savage my enemies while they can be jealous as shit that I have my mobility while their kids put them in a home due to their growing support needs.

After setting enough of these checkpoints, I think I like my life quite a bit now. Maybe some dissatisfactions worth blowing it up grow in time, but my life is better than it was at any stretch between checkpoints so far. Lessons learned, each time I set a checkpoint I try to do life better… out of spite (I no longer judge myself when I need what other people call “the wrong reason” to do the right thing by myself.

"I’m not even living at this point. I wake up everyday at like 12 or 1 and just do the bare basics of existing; eating too much, drinking, showering and sleeping. That’s it. I can’t even bring myself to do my own laundry or do the extremely simple and basic things I’ll occasionally write on my to do list if I feel up to it. I literally have 2 baskets worth of laundry sitting in my bathroom that have been piling up for weeks because I’m a lazy fuck who can’t do anything right. I have nothing going on; no social life at all, no fun and engaging career, no outings, no friends, nothing. I’ve made no strides to go to college or do literally anything with my worthless life, I literally can’t do anything. Every single day is exactly the fucking same. I’m not doing anything meaningful, productive, or fun in my day to day life. I absolutely suck at everything I do and my mind is so fried and blank that all I can do is scroll aimlessly on my phone just so I don’t completely break down. I literally cannot commit or dedicate myself to anything. I’ve tried many times to, believe me, and none of them have ever lasted or made me feel better as a person. Ive gained so much weight over these years despite multiple attempts at setting up a workout routine. I’m doing literally fucking nothing. I’m a lazy fucking slug.

I have a whole entire lifetime of failure and loneliness behind me. I’ve literally never had any friendships or relationships, any I did never lasted long or ended horribly. I’ve lost so many of what I considered friendships online and in real life. They all left me and discarded me once they got sucked and annoyed of me. I’ve literally had multiple friends tell me straight to my face that I was an annoying loser and that they only hung out with me because they pitied me.

I was so horribly bullied and isolated in school as well. I was nobody. Literally everyone, even the teachers, picked on me and treated me like pond scum. I sat alone in lunch every single day and every single person actively avoided wanting to be my partner in any class project and openly mocked me to my face. No prom, no parties, no outings with your few close friends, no clubs, no sports, absolutely nothing that all the other normal and accepted kids got to experience by default. I was the absolute outcast who even the other “unpopular” kids made fun of, because I’m inherently and fundamentally unappealing. 

All I have for me is a simple part-time job that I’ve had for 3 years. Am I getting anything out of it besides a paycheck? No, I’m still in high school socially. I literally cannot talk with anyone or hold even simple conversations no matter how much I try. No one really acknowledges that I exist or gives me any consideration except when I do something to help them. They all think I’m boring and stupid, with nothing meaningful to offer in conversation or literally anything.

I don’t know what your childhoods or teenage years were like, but I KNOW that I’m inherently unlikable and unappealing. I KNOW that who I am and who I’ve been at my core is so fundamentally flawed and disgusting that nobody has ever wanted me and has actively mistreated me. I’ve been getting that feedback loop my entire life without break simply by “being myself”. I’m the pond scum, absolute filthy pond scum who’s at the bottom of the food chain. I’m fat, annoying, unfunny, boring, unintelligent, untalented, uninteresting, ungifted and unsociable. That’s how I’ve always been, and what I’ll always be seen as. I had my chances to build myself into an infinitely better person when I was in school, but now that’s gone. I will never get to have the close friend group who’s out in my store chatting and laughing up a storm right next to me right now. I’m simply not worthy or good enough.

At this point? I’m just dull and bored. I have no future or interests or know what I want to do. I don’t know what is going to happen to me. Now I’ve made everyone in this sub hate me from my last post. I’m not gonna live much longer, I literally cannot survive like this anymore. It’s too much. I’m going to do something drastic at some point. I can’t do it anymore, i want to give up.

The worst part? Right now as I write this out, while I’ve been fucking up my life every step of the way, there is a 17 year old guy at the high school down my street who’s going out with the cute girl in his math class just by being who he is.

"you can't just shift from ""catastrophically depressed and exhausted"" to ""successful routine"" ... it takes itty bitty baby steps.

don't do all the laundry at once.

start with working out a little bit a few times a week.

if you do more it's a bonus.

think about how to make these things fun. folding laundry can bring me peace. workout routine, ehhh... but taking a walk to appreciate the animals outside, and the fresh air? going on a little run and getting my juices going? better. go explore someplace new.

keep in mind that STARTING a task is often agonizing but once you push the ball, keeping it rolling is a little easier. a lot of things are more fun once you get through the ""but ehhhh i don't wannNNAAAA NGGHHHHHH"" lol (I experience this regularly).

consider doing something that is in service to others, if you just can't stand doing anything for yourself. volunteer for the homeless, or for an animal shelter. go on [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) and look for groups that look like they might be interesting. don't go into it with expectations ... being undersocialized you'll probably be nervous, so just remember you're there to see how things are, not to prove anything to anyone or yourself. if you have fun, great! if you don't have much fun, oh well, let's try something else. in case you  worry about  like .. wasting other peoples' time there just by existing, remember you DO DESERVE just like everyone else there to be present if you want to.

most of all, stop thinking about this in terms of ""I am inherently x y or z"" .. it's just not true. like, biologically, evolutionarily, if it helps to think of it that way -- individuals of a species are built to be flexible. I have met people with actual severe developmental disabilities who are so fucking inspirational and make more of their lives than I do. saying ""I AM this"" is literally just a story you are telling yourself about your identity, but that doesn't make it an absolute truth. even if it feels like it is one, maybe step 1 is to remind yourself of this.. look at your negative self-talk as a train moving by. ""I am seeing my thoughts come by about how I hate myself and am a piece of human garbage. thanks for the negative reminders, now time to let them go until the next time they come up.. and then do the same thing again.""

YOU ARE JUST ANOTHER HUMAN AND DESERVE TO HAVE A SENSE OF DIGNITY LIKE ANYONE ELSE. don't let the shitty circumstances of life tell you different. life is weird like that .. it's got objective pieces, but so much of it is shaped by subjective beliefs.

in general dude .. do you really think other people are just magically talented and interesting and social? no matter how easy you think things are for someone else, you don't know their whole lives or what advantages or disadvantages they had. and of course people will have different things they are predisposed to being better at. but that doesn't make it a fixed thing. also everyone fucking trips up in social situations. i love people and get along well with my work crew, but I'm often an awkward mess and constantly second guess social interactions. what helps me is just to remember ""sigh ... it's gonna happen, doesn't define the whole relationship, just try to do better next time and move on/nobody actually cared about the awkwardness but me""... people don't really care or think that much about that kind of stuff because all of us are focused on ourselves, so try not to tell yourself everyone is like thinking all kinds of negative stuff about you if you go to a social thing. they probably don't give a shit lol.

it sounds like you had a hard time throughout your upbringing and idk what your specific situations have been. but just because people bullied you doesn't mean it's your fault. (that being said, idk what your specific behavior has been. were you a sex pest? did you say disrespectful things to people that were classed as ""annoying""? I mean it never hurts to take a self-inventory ... in an HONEST way that is not JUDGMENTAL, really important difference there. still sounds from what you described that a lot of people treated you in a way that was really inappropriate, and you shouldn't assume that to mean they were somehow 'correct about you as a person').

also consider joining some therapy and moreover support groups! find other people who are struggling and try to work together. whatever you can. also keep in mind that, from here on out, just because you are worried about being annoying or think someone thinks you're being annoying, doesn't mean you're annoying. we can't read minds. don't make the mistake of assuming what other people believe about you. if anything, when you talk to people, try to make it reciprocal ... ask them how they feel about the subject and if they seem kind of disinterested, move on to something else. make room to ask them about themselves. etc."		reply	na	na	na	0.9994545578956604	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth

"I notice how you describe yourself & say you have always been and always will be.... 
The world is much bigger than highschool. Don’t define yourself by how you perceive or were perceived by others in Highschool. It’s just a piece of who you not your destiny. Also, the way you see yourself is how others will see you. If you think you are this disgusting loser who no one gives a shit about & if you will stay in this mindset you will continue being miserable. I was diagnosed with depression when I was a child and I understand the feelings of dread, loneliness & severe lack of motivation. Ive struggled with this my whole life. The only thing that really made a difference was changing my outlook on life. 
Instead of focusing on what I don’t have & allowing negative thoughts & feelings to overwhelm me I try to stay in the moment and focus on small achievable goals. I force myself out of bed and I put one foot in front of the other. I find gratitude in what I do have. I try to be the friend & person I would want to have in my life.  People won’t judge or not want to be around you for having mental health issues, for being overweight or not having a great career. They won’t want to be around you because you aren’t growing & learning as a person. Because you are so focused on the negative & have given up. 
Change is hard. Things don’t just change one day out of nowhere. You have to work at it every day. It’s possible to feel better & to have a good life but you can’t expect it to just happen without changing your mindset. Good luck"		reply	na	na	na	0.9994545578956604	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"Hi there,

I am sorry to hear that you are going through such a rough time right now. You must feel so overwhelmed and hopeless at this point. You are not pond scum and you are not fundamentally flawed. I am sorry that life has done you wrong. You were made with a purpose and for a purpose and are valuable. Even though you feel that way, know that things can get 5 there are better days ahead even if that seems impossible right now. It will take time as you cant just wave a magic wand and be successful, popular, etc. Have you ever gone to see a therapist or talked with anyone about what you are going through? 

I had similar experience for the first 20 something years of my life. I was in special ed for the first couple years of school. Was told from early on that if I was lilucky I could get a GED. Was consistently told i would be lucky to bag groceries for a living. Was bullied as a result of being in special ed. Had no real friends and no real social skills. I did not know how to relate to others. I spent much of highschool depressed as everyone around me was having fun going to parties etc. My depression got worse until I could not get out of bed as a result. Went to therapy again and got out of the depression. When I finally got out I was able to start working on my life but had to heal first. I found that once I healed I was better able to make friends hold a job etc. It was stepping stones and had to take it one day at a time and one piece at a time bit by bit was able to build a normal functioning life. If you would like to chat further please message me. You are in my thoughts and prayers."		reply	na	na	na	0.9994545578956604	strong	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"Instead of all the negatives that you are seeing yourself, I am actually very impressed. You already have a part time job of 3 years, able to express yourself so clearly, and can write such a long passage to have a reflection of your life.

It sounds like you are going through some jealousy of the other guy going out with the cute girl that you wish to hang out with.  And you are going through a depression.  Please seek professional help for supports and diagnosis. They can also help you work through your thoughts and feelings and provide you with tools to improve your mental and emotional well-being.

Instead of just venting, try to take small steps towards making positive changes in your life, whatever that may be for you. Remember that it's never too late to make changes and improve your life, even if it feels impossible at the moment.

And most importantly, you are treasured and loved.  Your Creator God not only came, but loved you so much to even die for you."		reply	na	na	na	0.9994545578956604	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"For a couple years now, I've been doing this thousand yard stare out of nowhere. Since 2019, life has been rough. Allow me to give some context. 2019 my mom has a stroke, leaving paralyzed on the right side and gives her a brain injury having aphasia. 2020, I lose and uncle to covid, another to drunks, one more to suicide and I lose an aunt to lung cancer. 2021 one of my friends kills himself and I found the body. 2022, my girl friend cheats on me and dosent tell me for 3 weeks, in the same year my biological father overdoses and dies. And in this year one of my cousins almost dies in a car wreck.

So, yeah. Last 4 years have been nothing but hardship. But as the title says, I have started staring off into space when I'm sad, and sometimes it's for long periods of time.

"I’m recently recovering from a failed relationship with a girl whom I loved deeply but was not in a mentally stable place for a relationship. During our time together, she told me about her past SA in previous relationships. This made me really anxious around her to not trigger her or make her feel uncomfortable because I have always strongly disliked the idea of being a creep towards any woman. Even when she was receptive towards my touch (me tracing the lines of her tattoos or sitting close enough to be touching), I would never want to progress further because I never wanted to risk being a creep and her resenting me. Towards the end, she’d ask me why I didn’t get more physical with her when she would have let me, and I told her I didn’t want her to be uncomfortable. 

I have never initiated sex with a girl before and it makes it hard to do so when you don’t want to seem like a guy that only thinks about sex. The only 2 sexual interactions I’ve ever had with girls were when they initiated it with me and even then I was still extremely nervous about creeping them out if I reciprocated too much.

My anxiety has gotten worse recently to the point to where I can’t even progress in any relationship past purely platonic interactions because I feel like any show of sexual interest makes me disgusting. I read a lot of stories about girl’s feeling pressured or coerced into sex with a guy or just going along with it because they don’t want to be assaulted and it makes me sick. 

Tl;dr - I feel lonely and undesirable because I lack the confidence to make the first move and I don’t want to be labeled a creep if I do. I hate being like this but I just wish I had the charisma some guys do but I’m just too shy and awkward."

"In the everynsingle instance of consexual sex in the history, someone had to initiate the foreplay. In the vast majority of cases it was the man.

It’s perfectly normal to initiate sex as long as you’re doing it with a consenting partner. 

And you could always ask for the consent.

Or you could escalate your touch slowly step by step and see her reaction.

Start with a handshake. Go through incidental ->friendly ->intimate touches. And from hands -> thights -> face -> erogenous zones.

Remember -the sexual abuse is defined by the lack of consent, not by the touch itself."	Omega_misfit	reply	na	na	na	0.9976553916931152	weak	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"Seems like people have offloaded their sex shame onto you, and now you get to deal with the symptoms.  
From what I see on Reddit at least this seems to be a growing young man problem.

Here is the deal, people in general are looking for folks to get it on with, and many of them feel a similar shame you do on account of various social pressures.  
In vast majority of cases it plays out as woman has shame and will play the safe side of it, as in never tell a guy she wants him.  
Meanwhile guys are expected to get over their anxieties and make a move, as a corrective measure to the other persons inability to do so.

Now the main stumbling blocks I see online at least:  
\- is people being convinced you can manage someone else's emotions, more over that you are responsible for them  
And I wonder who is responsible for your emotional state, everyone else on the planet, or you?  
I would throw the idea of managing peoples discomfort right out the window.

\- the other is, wanting sex makes you a monster  
This line of thinking is pure shame spilling out of people, which again you are not asked to manage.

"I can see why your confidence has been knocked and it sounds like you feel like you're feeling really lost.

The conversation around consent hasn't really focused on showing how it can happen.   For example learning to read body language will tell you a lot. Is your partner enthusiastic,  kissing you back,  making good noises? Then keep going.   If your partner is just lying there, take a minute and check if she's in the mood.

Reading about your last relationship it sounds like you didn’t have a conversation with her about what would make her uncomfortable or how she would let you know if she was. If you come across this again I would suggest having that conversation, rather than assuming all contact is wrong

"It sounds like for now at least you could use some monk mode and acceptance.

You need to introduce yourself to a better version of yourself, and to do this you may need to make some lifestyle changes. The key to making habits that benefit you stick despite the reward not being immediate is to find versions of the better habit you like. Reinforce progress you make in mental health with physical health. Look for synergy that gets helps the constructive habits reinforce each other.

You don’t need to go to a gym and have to try to discover exercise while battling an unfamiliar social context. It’s possible to work a respectable bro split with a couple dumbbells and a bench at home. You can take baby steps on the privacy of your living space and build confidence in what you’re doing before introducing a social element.

It’s possible to level up bit by bit. It can seem slow, but a gamification scheme you design and implement for your self can help. Trial and error may slow things down as you find increasingly likeable ways to monk mode your core stats up, over time the friction between you and the reasonable goals you set as incremental steps goes away.

Any time you discover a goal in front of you is distant or consists of multiple elements, you subdivide that goal into smaller goals. The art of converting big goals until they are small enough to achieve is called project management, and just understanding the basics can help any career.

As far as acceptance goes, accept that you’ve got some weak areas in how you have been living that you can work on. As you keep working towards actualizo your best self, your prospects for finding a partner so intensely attracted to you that they will patiently help you work through this issue due to their unquestionable desire for intimacy will increase. When you find one of these, they could be a solid LTR prospect."	Omega_misfit	reply	na	na	na	0.9976553916931152	no	no	no	na	malementalhealth
"Women are more physically at risk from men than vice versa. There's no doubt about that, and taking steps to protect women and help them feel safe is important. (Like having your first few dates in public.)

But men are equally at risk emotionally. We need to protect ourselves from bad experiences and not only focus on treating women like porcelain dolls. This means we need to learn to *give* consent, not just *get* consent. I've had mutually unpleasant sexual experiences where nobody was really victimizing the other, but both of us felt pressured and regretted it after. 

There's also the angle that men are more likely to suffer legal consequences for such a regrettable experience: another reason to protect ourselves with safe consent practices. 

Talking is really important. It can often feel like we need to follow our instincts and go with some animal flow in order to get into a sexual moment. But that's when regrettable things happen. Take it seriously and talk with each other first. What are each person's sexual expectations? About foreplay? About exclusivity? About pregnancy? About STIs? About staying the night?

If this conversation leads to no sex, that's probably better than the eventual regrets about the thoughtless sex that would have happened. If you can get out of the toxic mentality of *men should want more and more sex of any quality*, you'll have more better sex and less bad."

"it's kind of you to be worried about this stuff. but just try to remember that women ARE sexual creatures too.

be mindful of body language (is she comfortable being physically close to you? does her body seem tense or loose? etc), take it slow (i.e. don't go from stroking arm or thigh immediately to grabbing ass and sticking tongue in her mouth lol .. ), maybe even try to discuss it beforehand if there's an opportunity. and when things are getting hot, just make half-steps to move forward and see if she reciprocates or seems uncomfortable ... and if it's the latter, just point it out.

"Obviously it changes based on the relationship as well as situation, but you should also learn to trust in your partner.

With my girlfriend we have had talks that if I went to far she would tell me and vice versa. From that point on I have trust in her that if she was genuinely uncomfortable with something I was doing weather that be initiating kissing, foreplay or whatever, that she’d tell me. 

Consent is never a bad thing, asking for it is a great thing, but don’t think asking can’t be done confidently. It can. It’s how I kissed my gf for the first time. It’s all about how you present yourself. I dropped her off and I looked at her straight in the eyes and all I said was, “I really want to kiss you right now, is that ok?” That’s literally all you have to do. 

It can be scary especially when not having much experience, I get it I’ve been there. 

Key Notes:
Asking for consent is always a good thing

Find ways to ask for consent in a confident manner

Trust that your partner would be open and honest to you about how they feel about any given situation

EDIT: I see you are worried about being labeled a creep, and in todays day and age I can understand why.

"Unpack in your mind exactly what it means to be a ‘creep.’   
‘The creep,’ is a social meme which gets conditioned into us. The fact is many women would rather deal with the occasional creepy guy (not dangerously so) than to never have a good man show interest.   
we all want to feel desired especially women.   
if you’re young, this will also come with experience, being comfortable with your desire and being able to express yourself sexually.   
if You‘re ever unsure about touching someone, ask for permission or state your desire like ‘I would really love to…’ communication is a wonderful thing,

"Hey man, i know it sucks but the truth is that 'creep' behavior is exactly what women are looking for, just from the right man.

The joke that women will treat a man very differently depending on how attractive they find him is true. Creep behavior is just doing the things men they find attractive do, but from a man they find unattractive.

Easy to get confused by this, because women very much don't want to acknowledge this is the case because of how obviously bullshit it is.

Tl;dr of course you were being a creep... had you done that to some random person. But to your girlfriend you're supposed to creep to the max, because she's already approved. That changes it to flirting.

"as much as it may be a sore spot, i do want to echo what others have said about being aware and concerned about consent with your partner, especially when she's a survivor.

I'm seeing a lot if posts about reading body language but honestly, you can just ask. Can I kiss you? Is this too much? I want to do x? Consent is enthusiastic but also continuous, and until you feel comfortable knowing what the boundaries are, just ask! if it kills the mood, then so be it, you were entirely in the right to ask and perhaps when things aren't hot and heavy, have a conversation of what those boundaries are, what that person likes and dislikes. as time passes you'll be more in tune with their responses and can go with the body language thing, but never feel like you can't ask. its an important conversation to have with every partner, and it doesn't hurt to check in every now and again. and if they say no, then that's fine! it says nothing about you, and by not doing it you're respecting their boundaries. win-win! a creep would hear no and press for it and ignore those boundaries. a creep would show no interest in that person as a person, i.e. their interests, experiences, values, etc. so long as you ask and check in, and see no as only an establishment of boundaries in that moment and not a judgment placed against you (easier said than done for some, i know), i think you'll be golden."

"I'm a 44 year old man. My health is where I thought it might be in my 60s not my 30s and 40s. I started having to wear glasses at around 37. I just had a cataract removed in my left eye and have a smaller one in my right that will have to be removed eventually. They joked that I was their pediatric case for the day. I laughed, but it's one of many issues I have going on. My testosterone tanked in my mid 30s. I have no sex drive even though I'm taking testosterone. I have PTSD and am taking 2 antidepressants as well as Adderall after being diagnosed with ADHD this year. I am also taking Spravato treatments twice a week. I worked out religiously from 2017 until 2020 when I tore my dominant arm's elbow tendon. Had surgery and physical therapy only to find out I also had a torn rotator cuff that was missed. I am scheduled to have that repaired in June. Anyway, I stopped working out and my mental health tanked. It kept me sane and healthy since I am battling being pre-diabetic. Diabetes has destroyed both of my parents and my father died at 68. My mother is incredibly unhealthy and sick because of it. So, I just worked and laid in bed the next 8 months. I was finally able to get the job I wanted, but once I started I had zero motivation. I just don't seem to care about anything at all. 

My mother is also in a neglectful skilled nursing facility because she's a hoarder and wouldn't let anyone in her house for months. I did a welfare check and she was almost dead when they found her from sepsis in her large intestine. She's better now, but constantly harangues me about how terrible it is there. Yet I have tried to get her in assisted living and she refuses. Her paranoia and need for complete autonomy is pathological. She wants to live on her own again yet will inevitably end up back where she is. I have no legal right to make decisions for her. I contacted the ombudsman about her complaints and gave her the number for 13 facilities that do Section 202 housing for the elderly with health issues. I can only hope she allows a housekeeper in once a week to help her stay clean and safe. 

I know I am lucky to live in an era where my health problems can be treated otherwise I would be blind and crippled in my 40s. I have health insurance although these issues are still expensive to fix. I should be grateful but if I have all these issues now I know it will only get worse. I've watched it in real time with my mother who is unrecognizable from when she was in her 30s.

"First of all, try to find some other exercise routine that your injuries don't interfere with, even if it's not very intensive. Daily walks, yoga, stretching, and a bit of cardio would probably help a lot. 

The other bit of standard advice I'd give is to try to form a serious medication routine. There are a ton of techniques out there, but I suggest some of the more intensive forms. You should aim for at least an hour a day: if you can pull it off, you'll definitely see improvements in terms of energy, focus, general happiness, etc. 

I can't speak with any certainty about your mother, or your relationship with her, so you'll have to decide on how to deal with her yourself. All I can observe is that while it's clear that you love her, you should remember that she loves you, even if she makes things difficult. Dealing with aging parents can be very painful for all parties involved. Just try to be open and honest with her. 

I'll also remind you that, even if it is isn't practical for your situation, you should at least contemplate the most straightforward way of dealing with your aging mother: have her live with you.
