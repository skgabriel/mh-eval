"We moved in together in March right after we got married and I was financial supporting the both of us since she had no job (prior she was living with her sister and planning on getting her masters). I added her to my only checking account. She had $2000 in her own account which she hasn’t touched.  


  
Fast forward to July, 2 weeks after she gets a job she says that going forward we should keep our finances separate. This rubs me the wrong way and I say “Interesting that when I was the only one earning all the money was “ours” but now that you have a job now things are yours vs mine.” From March to July I’ve spent at least 10k on furniture, appliances for us and 4k to have her green card filed. So she responds saying that for the next 5 or 6 months we will pause on separating things and keep things together to make things “fair” since I’ve paid for everything. Basically all our income goes into our joint account.  


  
Now yesterday we have this discussion again. She says she’s firm on keep things separate but we should both do our research and come to a plan that we both can agree on. So nothing is final for now but she did mention that since she makes less than I do so it wouldn’t be fair for her if we split expenses 50/50. I make 74k year with a 401k, dental and healthcare that also covers her. She works under the books since she can’t legally work yet and so no taxes but no benefits either ($3200 cash monthly).

  
She says if things ever got ugly between us she needs a sense of security that she will have a financial cushion to rely on. I told her it feels as if its an insurance plan to protect her against me and that she doesn’t fully trust me. I feel like she is too focused on her “Plan B” but she says she is trying to be practical about her future and I responded saying what about “our future.” She told me I am reacting only emotionally and not thinking from her perspective. She says her she has trauma from her abusive sister threatening to kick her out multiple times when she had no job and she doesn't want to feel unsafe again. I have made it clear to her I need time to process this because if this was discussed before marriage or right as we moved in together I wouldn’t be feel this sour about it as I am now. The timing of all this rubs me the wrong way. She says even if things are separate everything is still ""ours"" but its doesn't feel like it to me.

  
TL;DR: Wife want to separate finances but only brings it up as soon as she starts making money.

"OP, I have experience with this as I immigrated my husband here on a K-1 visa, which I presume you guys also did since you moved in so fast and she still can't work.

Her request is a giant, gaping red flag. And it WILL affect you during the removal of conditions phase. They will want to see some kind of joint account between you and you guys both sharing finances in some way - joint bank account, joint credit card, something. 

My suggestion would be to fire back at her that you need a joint marital fund account - checking and savings - and you each calculate how much you contribute based on household expenses and your equal share of those expenses with your income disparity in mind. So maybe you do 55% and she does 45%. I'm almost certain there's calculators online for this that will lay everything out for you.

If she is unwilling to do this, I would be heavily reconsidering your sponsorship of her visa. Period. I hate to say it but is the truth. This is a huge red flag.

I'm also going to tell you: she needs to stop working under the table like yesterday if you want to stay with her. This can get her **permanently banned** from the US."	Mike_Hawks_Bigg	reply	na	na	na	0.9943851232528687	weak	strong	no	na	relationships

"It's very common for women to feel like they need a safety cushion, and it makes extra sense when she's still in a precarious position in terms of legality and ability to provide for herself. I know this feels like it's her not trusting your relationship, but please try and consider her position as well - a lot of people get absolutely blindsided by people they trusted. And if something terrible happens to you it takes a *while* to get to insurance etc. 

I think another commenter provided what's likely a best / most realistic plan. Go over average monthly expenses, each of you put in amounts to cover those proportional to your income, remainder of income for you both goes in a private bank account. Other purchases can start to be paid proportionally as well.

Get a joint account for common expenses and keep the rest separated.

"I see how it could make you anxious, like she's looking for a way out. But try to bear in mind the struggle women go through in times of crisis, particularly immigrants and WoC.(assumption)

It's not that she doesn't trust you, it's that there is little to be lost by splitting finances, and much to be gained (her peace of mind). Especially as you still make more money than her, so she's actually coming out with access to *less* money.

That's important I think. *It's so important to her that she have financial independence that she's doing so in a way that ""costs"" her financially.*

In my opinion, the right thing to do would be to not take this personally, but try to empathise with the position of a person who wants very much to be financially independent, to have their own money and to feel like they could make it alone if they had to.

In some ways this makes your bond stronger, because she's demonstrating that she's definitely *choosing* to be married to you, and doesn't just have to stay to survive in relative comfort. Of course I can also understand why you might feel like she doesn't trust you, or is somehow planning to leave in future. But think of it like putting a fire escape on the side of a building. You don't want a fire. No one *expects a fire in their future*. But you sleep soundly knowing the ladder is there if you need it.

If the mechanics of running the household are a problem, you could still have a joint account for things like regular groceries and bills. You could either pay a percentage of your income or a set amount. Both have benefits but either way you could be described as being equally invested in each other's welfare and that of your shared responsibilities and you both have excess money to spend how you'd like, and you'd have more of it because you earn more at your job.

"So.. I understand what you're saying. It seems unfair that when she didn't work she wanted access to everything, but now wants her own account for money. As a woman I kind of understand her position about needing a safety net too, because we really don't know what will happen in marriage. Abuse happens easily, as does divorce. Divorce can take 2 or so years, even then financial support isn't always finalized.

I've personally witnessed a situation where the woman had no safety and it was terrible.They only had a joint account and he had an old separate one. She struggled so bad and her husband changed where money would be deposited right when things got sour. She had to rely on family to eat because the entire situation was so crazy. She did have a job before, but had to stop for various reasons. So she was quite literally screwed. She loved and TRUSTED this man for 10+ years. Your wife is in a foreign country, at that. I'm assuming she has no family here?

"There can be a mix of shared finances and some separate accounts. Personally I'd think most accounts should be shared with marriage but there could be multiple accounts for various reasons or purposes. Seperate accounts for some amount of disposable income could reduce some conflict about money in general. There might be separate accounts for direct deposit or retirement. Maybe a shared bank account for shared expenses. Maybe a shared IRA from roll overs or yearly deposits.

Her plan b reasoning would give me pause too. At the same time I would be on the same page about having a backup and can understand her wanting some financial independence. The backup could be in the form of an emergency fund or some cash on hand. You could also explain how she wouldn't be left with nothing during a divorce if that's her concern."

"I can agree on not splitting expenses 50/50 when one spouse makes more income. Expenses should be pro-rated on income. So if one spouse makes 70% of the income, they handle 70% of the expenses. This leaves both partners with an equal share of the expenses (relative to their income) and ensures both spouses have some money left over (relative to their income). One spouse is not stacking cash while the other is struggling. 

Separate finances to some degree is always a good idea in my opinion. There needs to be some idea of ""my money"" vs ""your money"" but also a good idea to have a joint account. Certain amount of money from each pay, from each spouse, gets put into the joint account to cover the shared expenses/save for any future purchases, trips, etc. Meanwhile both partner still has their own account with their own money to spend/save how they like. 

Also important if one partner tends to spend more than the other. Too easy for one partner to spend over into the other partners money if all income is shared.

"So obviously there are some potentially very bright red flags here in regards to - are you being used for a green card? Like, those are real risks. 

On the other hand, lots of couples like to have *some degree* of separation in their finances. The most common pattern I've seen is that each partner makes a certain level of contribution to the joint funds, commensurate with their income, which are spent on joint things like housing and furniture or even joint vacations, and the rest is largely yours to do with as you wish, within reason (above a certain threshold, purchases require a conversation even if they're with ""your"" money.) 

And obviously any division of joint-vs-individual income now should recognize the contributions that you've already made to the joint financial situation. 

Assuming she's operating in good faith, there's room for a healthy discussion and negotiation here. Is that a fair assumption? That's not so clear.

The fairest way would be to pool everything on pay day, take out for bills food and other expenses, put a portion in joint savings then split the rest down the middle.

"Emotions aside, splitting finances is simple, smart, and common. Combining finances can put some people on edge and make them feel insecure (despite having access to more money, oddly enough).

You both have one joint account wherein you put money proportionate to your combined household income. For example, if you make 60k and she makes 90k, that's 150k. 

60/150 = 0.4 = 40%
Therefore you put in 40% of your income and she puts in 60% of her income. That money goes toward your living expenses, joint savings, etc.

Everything else is personal money. You can choose to put more than your 40% or she her 60% into a couples saving account if you want, it's up to you guys to discuss.

"I know that this is a shock to you and it is very unsettling right after getting married but I can almost guarantee that she has always thought this way and it was something that you both should have discussed before marriage. There could be a cultural difference here as well. 

The most important thing to remember is what is best for your marriage. She has a legitimate need to feel safe and secure. I agree with you that it isn’t healthy to start making exit plans a few months after getting married. Let’s give her the benefit of the doubt. If something happens to you she needs protection. Think of a healthy compromise that will allow her to feel safe while building your lives together. 

There’s a lack of words here so maybe I’m projecting but I get the feeling that this is a cultural issue with her-that she was taught to protect herself or maybe she grew up with a domineering father who nickel and dimed her mother. Talk to her about her fears and try not to take her past as a reflection on how she feels about you.

"You should have discussed this before marriage, but even if you had, it would still make perfect sense to revisit and renegotiate periodically, especially after an income change for either of you.

Your very first step should be to talk to your immigration lawyer and find out what you need to know about shared and separate finances and your wife’s ability to work, without fucking up her visa situation.  THEN talk about finances.  But at a very high level it makes perfect sense to me that you would split shared expenses proportionately to your incomes, and each of you would maintain some separate accounts as well.  She does need her own money for security.  You would do well to have separate funds too, but an immigrant woman has some unique financial vulnerabilities.

I'm not surprised based on her trauma and the fact that she had to rely on you for green card stuff. I've also heard nightmare stories about people using green card etc as a weapon against their partners in the past, she probably is very aware of those cases too and having experienced some issue with her own flesh and blood (sister), that's going to make her less trusting.

Maybe she'll save up $ and pay you back for the fee you have to pay too. Maybe that's in her mind. You were 'doing her a favor' so she wants to earn her own $$ and then make contribution and pay you back.

"My(29f) husband(31m) and I had separate finances when we got married. We originally started with paying equal amounts. But since I make 1.5x his salary, he had nothing left for himself after bills when I had all this extra money after my half was paid. 

I didn't take him bringing this up to me as being a jerk or sneaky, I took it as he needs some security too and wants stuff for himself. These are both valid feelings.

So I did the math to see what percentage of our paychecks covered the joint expenses (wound up being 60% each). So now we both put 60% of our paychecks into a joint account, and whatever is leftover is our own. Do I still have more money leftover than he does? Yes. But he has more money leftover than he ever had before. 

I wasn't angry that more of my paycheck was going to bills now (30% of my paycheck and almost 100% of his is now 60% and 60% respectively); I was angry with myself that I was so stuck on it being even that I couldn't see him drowning.

I'm not going to lie, I would delete this. The internet is the internet and you could be reported.

But on to the advice.... What is the issue? If she wants to keep finances separate, then just give her 2 caveats to that decision:

1. We will not go back to a joint bank account as she has made it clear that she would rather be separate, so WHATEVER happens in the future, you are staying on separate accounts

2. If she asks for money, she has to give you the reason for the money and your final approval on the purchase (your money, after all).

"She's being perfectly reasonable and you're being toxic with shit like this

>Interesting that when I was the only one earning all the money was “ours” but now that you have a job now things are yours vs mine.

It's important for each partner to retain their ability for self-sufficiency and simultaneously provide redundancy in an emergency. We see too many stories of situations of abuse, divorce, separation, illness, or disaster where one or the other partner is left without a means to provide for themselves because everything was in the other partner's name or control. Similarly we see stories where one partner, in an attempt to ""protect their assets"" clears out the shared accounts and removes the other partner from having access. 

>Wife want to separate finances but only brings it up as soon as she starts making money.

Think about this statement for a moment - she only wants a separate account AS SOON AS SHE STARTS MAKING MONEY... which means prior to this she had no reason to have a separate account because she had no income, it was all YOUR income and YOUR account. Of course it makes sense to do now that she has income. She's even met you half way with acknowledging what you've provided for the both of you and delaying separating the accounts. 

I personally don't think she should have to make that accommodation. I think this is much simpler than you are allowing it to be. 

1. You each have your own accounts that your paychecks go into
2. You each pay yourselves first (emergency and personal savings/investments)
3. You divide up the bills based on percentage of income i.e. 74k / 74k + 38k = 65% (your responsibility) and 35% her responsibility. 
4. Every pay day you transfer your portion of the bills into the household account  
You could lump in some small offset for the cost of healthcare you provide to her if you felt it necessary
5. Setup autopay and budget billing on as much as possible
6. Agree on who is responsible for paying the bills out of the shared account
7. Agree on what happens to excess money in the shared account (quarterly/yearly)
8. Setup a shared savings account for household purchases, vacations, etc
9. Define how much goes into shared savings each month 
10. Talk about any changes that need to happen regularly
11. Whatever money doesn't go into personal savings, household bills, or shared savings is your own individual discretionary money. 

This is the system my partner and I have and it works great. While bills are split unevenly because of differences in our income, we both decided to contribute the same amount to our shared savings for vacations and family gifts. While I could contribute more than they can, it feels more equitable to them for this specific type of spending. They also have their own 401k savings, emergency fund, and investments. If anything were to happen to me, to my accounts, or to our shared accounts (i.e. hackers or scammers) then their accounts are all there to fall back on. 

My biggest concern for you two is that you can't talk about it in a trusting way. You've immediately jumped to the worse case scenario because you see her jumping to a worst case scenario. Her approach is risk mitigation. What risk are you avoiding in your assumption? That she'll leave you if you don't keep her financially entwined and dependent on you? That's not a great strategy. Instead you should be acknowledging and trying to hear what her concerns are, active listening, and working with her on equitable terms. Women no longer need a man to be the ultimate provider anymore, they need men who are partners in helping them achieve their own goals. Marriages work best when each partner is sharing in the other's goals. You should be full throated in support of her financial goals and she should be similarly supportive of yours. Make it happen.

I'm going to hope I'm wrong but sounds like she is accomplishing the typical goal of a woman without papers.

Take her name of your account and tell her you just want to feel safe in case she leaves. It will either bring out her  intent or cause her to see why she is wrong. It may be a blessing in disguise.

"Personally I think it's a good idea for her to have a separate bank account, as long as she isn't hiding money from you. You should have a way to verify each others balances. Logic dictates not putting all your eggs in one basket in case something like a hack happens.

To me, you should have one joint account that you pay your household expenses from. Figure out those expenses, then figure out what percent more the higher earner earns. So it could be the higher earner contributes say 60% to the joint account and the other 40%. Mind you this is only for household expenses. Health care comes from you because you're the one who has the job that offer the plan ( you could see what you pay a month and have her kick in her percentage) Retirement albeit self funding or 401k should be on the individual accounts.

To me, this seems like a fair way to go about it.

BTW, my wife and I just throw it all into one account, but we are mostly on the same page with our spending habits and rarely fight about money. For us, this is just easier.

My husband and I have the bulk of our assets in shared accounts, but we each kept an individual account as well when we got married. Our paychecks both go to the joint checking account, and we each receive a monthly ""allowance"" to spend on personal stuff, that we move to our separate accounts.

"If things ever got ugly between you, she'd get deported and you'd still split assets.

It's a commonly held misperception that a loophole of community property states is to have different checking accounts.

In those states, any assets owned by either party go into the communal pot.  The exception are assets that were owned before the marriage and kept out of communal assets, but over time even that distinction is watered down.

If she wanted to keep her assets her own, she should not have gotten married.  It sounds like she needed to get married for the GC, but wants to keep her money to herself so she can bail if and when she gets her citizenship.

Any examination of my posting history would demonstrate that I'm as cynical about marriage as they come, but this post doesn't convince me to alter my perspective.

She wants the citizenship of marriage, she also splits assets.  Her ""protection"" is to be a good partner and that she'll get 1/2."	Mike_Hawks_Bigg	reply	na	na	na	0.9943851232528687	no	no	no	na	relationships

And there is your answer.

These three combined would have anyone not wanting to be reliant on someone. We all see how quickly relationships can go south at the drop of a hat and her being 100% reliant on you for not only her finances, but essentially her whole life will put someone in this position.

Only advice if you want to retain this relationship is to keep the receipts on what you spend jointly and stop spending on her.

Edit: There is also a nice legal aspect to it that is beneficial to you. If you were found to be the recipient of her pay owing to her illegal works, you would also be charged along with her.

So I'm only assuming she is hispanic. If so it probably comes from the idea of female privilige that comes from Machismo culture. She figured it was normal to spend your money and now 50/50 is doing more than she is culturally used too so she feels she can negotiate. Just stay firm on 50/50 bills wise. I would have 3 different accounts where each of you put 60% of your income in one and that's the expense account, then the rest goes to your regular account. You can validate her need for independence while also validating your need for a fair and trusting relationship. Emphasize that this is important to keep the percent equal, the extra 10% from each of you can be for emergency expenses and mutual purchases. If something cost more then what you have jointly then you split the cost 50/50 of the remainder from your personal fund.

Also 50/50 is unrealistic because of income differences, let alone earning potential of different careers. What partner would make their struggling artist husband/wife pay 50/50 on their mercedes car payments because they earn 300,000+. Ridiculous.

Totally agree with the advice for how to do a hybrid (some together and some separate) finances. Its very common. Its smart for anyone's circumstances. It has added benefits like giving you each a sense of individualism. Plus, for someone who's been financially strong-armed by someone before, like you mentioned your wife has been, it provides a necessary feeling of safety, which only adds trust in your relationship. You're entering into a partnership where ideally you'll be building eachother up and supporting one another, this is how you do that. By agreeing to work out a plan, you're telling your wife that her sense of safety matters to you and shows YOUR trust in her (i.e. that neither of you will deceive the other with this privacy, its something you'll be able to communicate about comfortably, and you don't need complete access to her money to use against her nor her to you).

Seems fair to me.  She wants to pay you back for the money you spent on her and then keep things separate.  Splitting things proportionally by income is generally the fair thing, though you should base yours on post-tax-and-benefit income.  Both of you deposit into a joint fund for bills and groceries, and then you both have separate accounts for your own things.

I have had 3 serious live-in relationships in my lifetime; in the first two, I made more than them and I paid for more because of it. In my current marriage, my husband makes more than me. We split everything 50/50 when just dating but when he wanted me to move in with him, I explained how I felt we should split our finances, and he balked at it. Nevertheless, we ended up splitting it more like 45/55, until he got laid off during COVID. Me paying for everything for both of us until he got another job really showed him that I'd put my money where my mouth is, and it softened him towards the idea of us each keeping a percentage of our checks in a separate account as a safety net. Now we both keep 20% to ourselves in our own separate accounts and the rest goes into a joint account to pay for shared expenses.

Amen to all of this. Neither of you is necessarily being unreasonable. I have a daughter and one of the things I hope she leaves my house knowing, it's that a woman always, ALWAYS needs an exit plan. Even if she's not voluntarily exiting, I know plenty of older women who were involuntarily exited. I hope my kid (1) always keeps a job that will keep her up-to-date and self sufficient and (2) makes sure she has access to the money she needs in an emergency. That can take a lot of different forms: sufficient credit, completely separate finances, a gtfo account, whatever. We have completely joined finances but I have control of our finances and could segregate myself a reasonable amount (i'm not a monster, which is why my partner trusts me to handle all the money) before my partner could even find the passwords.

"A lot of women in green card marriages also end up trapped and abused. Makes total sense to want to avoid that. She could be playing OP, or she could be smart and just protecting herself. 

OP, it would be a huge red flag for me if I explained to my husband that I was trying to ensure my own security in the event of divorce/untimely death/all the other things that could go wrong, and he pushed back and tried to guilt trip me about trusting him. Obviously none of us know you and your wife to know what other red flags exist, but right now both of you are waving red flags. Present a fair option based on percentages of income like other posters have suggested. If you won’t do that, you are the red flag. If she won’t do that, she’s the red flag and you may need think a little more about how to protect yourself in the situation. If neither of you can compromise, go your separate ways. This is the sort of fundamental values type discussion that should really be ironed out before you enter into a legal contract to share your life with someone, which is what marriage is.

"I think that's too much of a generalization to say it ""flat out doesn't happen"" because it does. Women are frequently left in a situation where they don't have their own credit or financial capabilities because it was all either left in the husband's name or under a shared account that they were added onto (not primary holder). It depends on the states definition of marital assets. If things got ugly right now just a few months after marriage then she'd likely walk away with whatever she has in her pockets. 10 years from now that might be a different story as they accumulate wealth and belonging together. At the same time lawyers often find reasons they can use to limit the amount the other spouse walks away with and some states don't have mandatory maintenance rules. This is all especially precarious for anyone who is in the immigration pipeline where any misstep can put them back at square one and with big expenses to deal with in order to proceed.

It is possible for him to leave her with nothing. While the I-864, Affidavit of Support exists and CAN be enforced in MOST states, that doesn't mean it gets enforced in a uniform way regardless of it's Federal origin. Remember states have responsibility over divorce preceding and not the Federal government. Each case and court proceeding will be different. Like at the state level, at the federal level it also requires the sponsored person to be able to get someone to help with enforcement i.e. getting a lawyer to file a I-864 enforcement lawsuit and whatever costs if you have to go all the way to court vs a settlement. In between the sponsored person is screwed and has to rely on whatever money or income they have alone. Also, if for whatever reason, her green card is denied (it's been filed but not approved yet) the obligation outlined in the I-864 is not enforceable at that point. There's a huge difference between what the law spells out and actual execution of the law, enough so to say that it IS possible for him to leave her with nothing but what's in her pockets and that it DOES happen with enough regularity that you cannot claim it's impossible.

"My partner and I met through work, about 7 years ago. We both had partners at the time, and we had an affair with each other. We communicated almost exclusively through snap chat while we were doing so. We have been out and in a relationship for the last 6 years.When we left our respective partners we both agreed to delete the snapchat app as we had both primarily used to to cheat on previous partners.In October last year my GF said to me that she was going to reactivate her snapchat account as she felt that her younger cousins, nieces, and nephews communicated almost exclusively on it and she felt out of touch (We live about two hours from her home town).I said I was uneasy about this because we both had such toxic histories with this app in particular, but if she felt she needed it for her family, that she should download it and use it for that. I said I would not be comfortable at all with her using it for anything other than that, or in particular using it to contact any mutual, male, colleagues.Fast forward to three weeks ago, and we were in our kitchen, her phone dinged with the snapchat notification noise. I picked it up, and did not look at the screen and moved to hand it to her. She grabbed it out of my hand and put it in her pocket and said ""Oh I told you I was snapchatting (Colleague)(M) didn't I?""I said, ""You definitely did not tell me that, you said you were using snap chat to be in contact with the younger family"" to which she responded ""Well I am using it to text (Colleague).""I left it at that, but I was very unsettled by the interaction and sort of felt that I had just been gaslit.Last week I brought it up again and asked how long she had been using snap chat to text a colleague and she admitted almost from the day she downloaded it. I asked what she had been discussing with the colleague and she said she had been discussing his open relationship, and how she would like an open relationship, but I would not be able to handle it.I feel utterly betrayed by how she broke an explicit boundary with snap chat we had agreed.I feel even more betrayed that she had used it to discuss our sex life. And to have told a colleague what she supposed were my sexual limits (that I wouldn't be able to handle an open relationship). I feel totally betrayed that she lied to me when downloading the app, and that as soon as it was on her phone she broke the only specific boundary I had with it.I actually feel that I can't forgive this and that I will end the relationship. Can anyone advise how I could resolve these feelings. Or how I could explain how betrayed I feel without it coming out as an accusation. Am I even right to be feeling this way?TL:DR! Feel betrayed and don't know how to get over it or even if I'm right to be feeling this way

She wouldn't have done it in the first place if she did. Not only that but the lying is a major problem... She lied about that, how can you take her word that she hasn't done anything else? I.e.

Why would you want to stay with a partner that lied to you about why they wanted to start using snapchat again THEN lied to you about who they were snapchatting while intentionally breaking your relationship boundaries?

"Sorry, man. As someone who's cheated in the past but tried to turn myself around, it can be difficult to hear from people that you're forever tarnished by a mistake you made seven years ago.

It sounds like she's been considering fucking this guy since before she downloaded snapchat, and has been using it probably exclusively to build rapport and manoeuvre a potential hookup. She's pretty much outright told him that she's DTF. She might not have cheated yet, but she wants to fuck this guy and is continuing to take steps to bring about the circumstances where it could happen.

Sounds like you need to drop her. And it's going to be hard, because you know that as soon as you do, she's going to be straight into bed with this guy, feeling guilt-free. Just know that it probably won't last, and in a few months she'll feel regret, and hopefully you'll be in a better place to either turn her down gently (if she asks, which of course isn't guaranteed) or just move on with your life and heal.

Inconsiderate people are not worth your time. And just because you cheated once, that doesn't make you a shitty person.

If she was just upfront with you about make coworker and snap chat, maybe this would be different. But it seems like the trust you have is broken because she kept it a secret. Personally if I ever cheated with a cheater and we were in your position, I feel like I would have to have a very open book policy with my partner. Because of the history. 

For me, snapchat plus chatting the polyamorous coworker and also telling him I want an open relationship but my partner doesn't would be too much for me.

OP, you don't have to validate your feelings. They are what they are. So, yes, you're entitled to feel betrayed or anything else bcuz they're *your* feelings. 

Getting over it is a different story and should probably involve psychological therapy, based on your provided history. This would be a good time to do that before you get into another toxic relationship.

Is it right to feel this way? I mean, again, you feel what you feel. Who gets to judge it to make it ""right""?

"I (38M) am upset that my wife (38F) kept flowers sent to her work from the guy she had an affair with. The affair ended \~6 months ago and I felt that we are finally getting to a place where I don't actively distrust her. She's a teacher and they were delivered yesterday, her first day with students for the semester.

She called me between classes to thank me for sending her black roses and wanted to know what they symbolized to me. She was excited (genuinely excited) and I was confused. When I explained that I didn't send them she got really quiet and her tone/mood dramatically dropped. I asked if he sent them and she said I don't know, there's no note, but if you didn't I don't know who else would. I told her if they are from him to not accept them to which she responded she already accepted the delivery and doesn't know who they are from. Que the start of her next class and we don't talk about it again for the day. I did not specifically tell her to throw them away or anything like that, but I felt like my ""you can't accept those if they are from him"" set my expectation clearly.

I had already planned a mini celebration for that afternoon when she got home. I had already bought her flowers for the house, cooked her favorite dinner and bought her something she wanted for her classroom. We had a great afternoon and the flowers at her work doesn't come up.

Today, she sends me a picture of her class (related to a txt conversation we were having) and almost off frame I can see the flowers on her desk. I ask if that's what I'm seeing, she confirms, I ask if he sent them, she said he had sent her a text message later that day confirming they were from him. At this point I'm like What the Actual F?! Why would you keep them? She basically says they are just flowers, she doesn't care about him at all and ""You know how much I like flowers, and I have never gotten flowers at work before, so I just decided to pretend they are from you."" Then when I push back she tells me I never made it clear I expected her to throw them away, but she says she will, and shortly thereafter sends me a picture of them in bent up and stuffed into her small trashcan.

I'm very upset about this but not sure if I'm blowing this out of proportion in my own mind. I am fairly confident she has not been talking to him and that she has not been around him. She's had her location on her phone on since I decided to give this another chance, I don't check her phone, I don't have the passcode and I told her I didn't want it when she offered (edit to add this was at the beginning of our reconciliation) - that if I wanted to go through her phone I'd do it in front of her. I'm wishing I could silently check her phone right now - this will start a fight if I demand to check it when she gets home.

tl;dr

Wife and I have been reconciling for the last 6 months. yesterday her exAP sent her flowers to work, I told her not to accept them, she did anyway, but insists it's not about him, she just likes flowers.

Honestly, the fact that she kept his phone # and didn't block him is a huge red flag. That would be a must for me. He's showing he still has interest, and she's not doing anything to let him know she's not interested. Hopefully, you're already in therapy.

She cheated and if the flowers piss you off it is her problem not yours.  The dude texted her......so she isn't blocking him and that is a bigger problem as you cannot trust her.

Then she put a ring she got from him in our jewelry box that we used to keep our rings when not wearing them.  Obviously that got me as well.

Looking back it seems like my ex was putting these things out there to get a reaction.

"My general advice for affair recovery is that both sides need to be in 100%, the wayward one must be transparent and trustworthy at all times, and they must actively avoid situations which could reasonably be suspicious.

If you ask and she refuses, how could she expect trust? If the phone leaves your sight and she changes her mind, checking is worthless.

"Hey boss,

My first question to you is, is it easier to stay and work on this?
- you should outline your expectations and lack of trust in your partner.
- you seem to love your partner and clearly do what you can for her while she is at work.
- ask what lead her to being unfaithful to see if its something that could be worked on to prevent it.
- does she seem recipricate interest in the relationship or is it like a room mate relationship?

Second, Do you think she is trying?
- from what it sounds like she has cheated (obvi) but not fully implemented anything to prevent from doing so again.
- she has kept flowers, has the other guy unblocked, and is (from your view only) seemingly nonchalant about it.
- she doesnt seem very apprehensive or conscious of the fact you are upset about it. If the guy sent flowers and she asked the meaning and discovered it was him she SHOULD say something to help build trust and do right by throwing it away. The fact she kept them is mad suspicious. Meaning death, despair, hatred, rebirth and all that BS ""i dont get flowers and decided it was from you"".. sus is all im saying.

Third, do you think you'll be alright being single?
- lonely.. but no obligations.

Honestly man if i was in your shoes at that age i would want to know if i have something serious going on or if im just wasting time. Married because you have kids together? Stick it out get a hobby.. Alot of assets together? Choose what your plan is there. Is she supposed to be the ""soulmate""? After repairing and trusting for 6 months, if it was just because then ask yourself if that is something you are willing to cope with. Like everything in life a one sided story always gives us the villain right? Things get muddy when we include both sides of the story. Doesnt justify an affair.. but what led to the belief it was.
My opinion is she is looking for options and fun, she is older and likely misses that attention. She is smart enough to be teaching students in college i assume and so i submit she is not dumb enough to think that this wouldnt have been a problem, children pick up on cues faster than she reportedly did on your ""not from me"" text. Maintain your calm and ask what she expects out of your marriage.

I swear most these comments just read the headline of the post and not the full post or your comments. It's your prerogative to forgive your wife, but that requires actually forgiving her and relearning to trust her. She was upfront about receiving the flowers and didn't deny who they came from, so that's at least something. You wouldn't be wrong to want to verify, given she has cheated with this specific individual, but I honestly think you should be more concerned about her exAP potentially stalking her. It's pretty bizarre that he would send her *black* flowers supposedly well after she ended things with him. Flowers alone would be concerning if she truly has been out of contact with him, but the fact that they're black sends a darker message in my opinion and I find it alarming that everyone is more concerned about the previous infidelity than your wives safety.

"Reading your post, your agreement with her when she got the flowers was that if she knows that they're from him, she can't keep them.

You repeat your position multiple times: She can not accept the flowers *if* they are from him. 

I 100% agree with this position. It's incredibly reasonable.

*But she doesn't know they're from him.* She said ""I don't know who they're from, but I agree that if not you, he's the next most likely person,"" which is not the same as deciding they're from him. 

She thought they were from you. Women do, sometimes, get random flowers. 

So you're taking the position, ""If they're not from me, they must be from him. Ergo she has to throw them out."" She's taking the position, ""I don't know who they're from, ergo I don't have to throw them out.""

You're assuming they're from him. Notice how in the title of your post you even rounded up, ""I don't know, there's no note, but if you didn't I don't know who else would,"" to ""it was definitely him.

I totally 100% understand why this was upsetting to you. In the aftermath of an affair, something like this is going to be extra triggering. 

However, I think the root cause of the problem is that you're reading the conditions of your boundary (""you can't keep them *if them from him,"")* as true, and she is not.

They’re a powerful romantic symbol - why?

Because when you walk into the room, they are there. They’re beautiful, they smell lovely.

It's a situation that calls for some invasion of privacy to a point. I'd make sure my husband deleted contact info and blocked the person. After that, if the person found a way to contact him, I'd need him to tell them, in front of me, to no longer contact him. Gifts would need to immediately be returned or trashed. My husband has a very weird ex who still leaves him voicemails asking how his brother is doing (he's disabled). She texted him a week or so ago asking to see him. She knows about me, and that we've been together 15 years. She just contacts him when she's single. He tells me every time she contacts him, and he's never cheated.

I'll provide some context first

My [F18] boyfriend [M18] and I have been dating for 5 years, I am British and he is Iraqi so we often bunp into cultural differences but are easily solved because we are both open and understanding of eachother.

Now this is where the problem comes up.
My boyfriend has a sister a few years younger than us. His sister nor his mother have ever liked me but i just chalked it down to me being very alternative and them being fairly conservative.

Over the years I've noticed my boyfriends sister getting more visceral towards me and more touchy and clingy with him.

Now don't get me wrong I fully understand that siblings often play around with eachother as I have 2 brothers myself.

But she often hugs him and rubs and caresses him strangely, rubs his arms in an almost massaging way, leans against him while he's sitting down by putting her hands on his upper thighs, rubs her hands across his chest and will make comments like ""your hair smells so good"" or ""you are getting muscular now""

The way she does these actions is very off putting and she often makes derogatory comments towards me along the lines of ""he was mine before he was yours"" 

I spoke to my boyfriend about it and he said he didn't think that much into it because it's his sister but now he thinks about it he does see my point of view.

Our relationship has had some loyalty problems in the past which does plant seeds of doubt in my mind fairly often.

He ended up talking to his sister about it while I was there and she ended up catching onto the fact that it was me who brought it up and she started screaming at me that ""white trash like me wouldn't understand how close real families are"" as she put her hand on his lower stomach/upper crotch to hold him back from walking towards me.

I just walked out and my boyfriend followed about 5 minutes later.

He says he doesn't want to ruin his relationship with his family and doesn't want to take this further since his mum is now threatening to try and make him leave me and if he doesn't she will makenour lives hell.

I'm so lost and its genuinely such an uncomfortable situation but I'm also worried I'm looking too much into it. 

What do I do?

TL;DR my boyfriends sister keeps touching him weirdly sexually and making comments that she owns him."	ThrowRA24153	post	14.214011040341829	female	White	0.9980927109718323	na	na	na	126	relationships
"It's not really up to you, and you shouldn't have been there when he spoke to his sister about it. If his family isn't trying to ruin this relationship already, then they're doing a pretty poor job showing that.

He's allowed to ask for boundaries with his sister that make him comfortable. Remind him of that. What makes him comfortable doesn't have to be exactly what makes you comfortable, and it's definitely not up to his mother or his sister. It's only up to him. At y'all's ages, conflicts with family usually revolve around setting adult boundaries and gaining independence.

This is disturbing. It sounds like he’s just scared of losing his family and leaving the nest - there’s definitely some boundary issues with his sister and mom. If he really wanted to make you feel comfortable and secure then he would have told his sister that she needs to stop touching him inappropriately (this should not happen regardless of your romantic relationship.) I would trust your initial feeling, it’s valid and you’re uncomfortable for multiple reasons. Even if he doesn’t view this behavior as inappropriate and it’s really just that they’re a more intimate family - there should be some sort of middle ground you both can reach that can make sure you’re comfortable.

I’ve lived many years in the Middle East, and their family ties are just different than Western. They are much closer, they live at home until they’re married and sometimes they never leave even after they’re married. Now his sister appears to be too much and is obviously jealous of the attention he’s giving you, let alone the fact that you’re his girlfriend, as opposed to being his wife, which means that you represent everything that is “sinful” in their culture/religion. My advice would be to distance yourself from the whole family, including him. If you don’t want to break up with him, just refuse to see him where his family are around..

">that is what has set his mother off

Very common. Even for a parent who knows their relationship with their kid needs to change for the kid to be an adult, that's a tough transition. Lots of parents don't acknowledge that their relationship does need to change. But it's still important for him to keep gaining independence, although it would also be kind for him to offer some patience and grace to his mother.

I don't have much advice for his sister's boundary crossing, except that he could ask her what she'd think of a boyfriend's sister doing what she's doing. What her friends would say if they saw it.

Also, if something is making you uncomfortable then you don’t need to explain it, doubt yourself or push your feelings aside in case you’re “looking too much into it”. If you don’t feel comfortable then that’s enough in a relationship for your partner to hear you, validate your feelings and see what they can do to help.

There are clearly multiple problems in your relationship, apart from the predatory sister and the possessive mother.

It would be hard for me to trust dude after this. Especially the part about deleting the conversations which to me means he can control the narrative without you fully knowing what went down.

This is going to be hard to do as you're rightfully angry and likely hurt but I would have a heart to heart with him in the calmest way possible. No one deserves an emotional affair but if you want a man to open up you may have to settle down your nerves to have an open, honest dialogue about how you two can work out conflicts within the marriage. I would ask him if he was concerned about being judged or criticized and if he felt safe talking to an outsider instead? Again, not making that behavior ok but trying to understand where he's coming from and what is going on. I would also ask that he promise to never have secret convos with other women again and to cut all contact with this person. You both committed to marriage so I would also look into counseling. You will need to take stock on your level of trust to determine if you feel like you can give him another chance. The good news is he told you and didn't allow it to escalate into something more.

First train - You honestly think you can work with him to overcome this.  Get some counseling and try to get to the root of WHY he did this. People like to ignore that and immediately jump on the defensive. I'm not at all implying that what he did was excusable, but if you want to truly fix something you need to know why it's broken.

 In one way it really doesn't matter why he did it,  what matters is that he did do it instead of addressing his issues with you.

"They say you shouldn't keep score in relationships. So how do you stop? 

For example, my boyfriend (M33) and I (F32) went on a camping trip where I thought we'd camp for a few nights and then get a hotel room so we could shower and sleep in a real bed, explore the town. That's what we'd talked about before going on the trip. I wasn't familiar with the area so I figured we'd just book whatever was around and had vacancy.

After 3 nights in the woods he refused to get a hotel. We'd pass many hotels and I begged him to stop so I could shower. He said no. I offered to pay in full. He took us home instead, cutting our vacation short. He eventually apologized, said he was being cheap. But since then I haven't been keen to go on any trips with him. He offers and I decline. And whenever he refuses to do something or pay for something that I think is reasonable, I keep a mental note of it.

I know this isn't good. So how do you move forward instead of keeping track of all the slights?

TLDR: I've found myself not being able to let go certain things in my relationship, even after apologies. I'll continue to avoid situations where I'm afraid of reliving or rehashing the past."	Key-Nowhere	post	22.297840789909923	female	White	0.9990733861923218	na	na	na	10	relationships

I think episodes where that happens are a very reasonable thing to “count” and that you should not stop. You should take note. And when he hits a certain number or point, break up.

“Keeping score” only becomes a problem when it is about petty shit, like he forgot to buy you cheerios, or didn’t wear the shirt you asked him to. How you spent your vacation (especially when you offered to pay) is not one of those times.

And so here, it's not just about him changing his behavior around being cheap. It's about him changing his behavior about being reliable, true to his word, listening to you, and respecting your wishes. If he's demonstrating change in all those areas, then, okay, maybe this becomes about you learning how to let go.

Hi. Do you ever kiss/touch/hug her randomly? When sex isn't on the table. The reason I ask is because I was in a very similar situation a few years ago and it took me a while to work out what was going on, she might not have worked it out yet, if this situation is the same. The only time my partner showed me any affection was when he wanted sex. Everything was linked to sex, kissing, cuddling, even snuggling on the sofa. So affection became a request (not the biggest turn on). It built resentment and a feeling of only being wanted for sex. If every time you kiss it has to lead to sex, you'll stop kissing unless your willing to have sex. Some times a good kissing session followed by cuddling and watching a film can be more intimate than sex. Could this be a possibility for her?

I'm wondering if this has been what's missing from their previous convos?

"My best friend that I've known for 16 years committed suicide last week. He was my brother. The closest friend I have had, and will ever have, in this life. I flew back to my hometown the day I found out and spent the entire week around his family, his wife and her family, and his kids. My priority being back in my hometown was to be around his mother, his wife, and his kids. It helped me grieve being surrounded by his loved ones and being able to help them in anyway I could.  
  
I just flew back to where I live now and I am feeling useless. I feel like I need to be there for his mom, his wife, and his kids and I don't know how to do that across the country. His mother tends to isolate and says she wants to be alone, which I understand, but she has nobody in her life. She is divorced, no pets, and her kids have so many kids that they often aren't around. I want to be able to check in on her without ""checking on her"". As somebody who has experienced this this last week, it feels weird and pressured when somebody just asks, ""How are you?"". Well, I feel like shit. I know she feels like shit, too. I want to find a similar interest/hobby we can share which would allow us to talk without putting any pressure on here regarding the news of her son.  
  
The same goes for her kids. One is 3 and one is 8. The 3 year old isn't able to really comprehend what is going on, so I can check in on her easier. The 8 year old is old enough to understand. With her, calling her to ask how she is will be a bit easier than with his mother. That being said, I still would like to share some sort of hobby/interest with her that lets her know that I am here for her, without having to bring up her dad every time.

"Go to your local cvs/Walgreens and get any pictures of your friend printed out and mail them to the mom.  Maybe frame a nice one.

Write a letter telling her a few stories about her son about times you spent with him.  Mundane things, big things, whatever.

The other poster has a point that it’s only been a week even if they missed the part about you being far away. As time passes, it becomes important for you to communicate, send pics, send stories, send a fruit basket, whatever.  Because people say that the first few weeks or months after the loss is a whirlwind of support, but when the support fades, they may never even hear from many of those “I’ll do anything you need” type of people.  I’d focus on the longer term by sending a card, a photo, here and there now, but marking your calendar for 6 months, and for the 1 year anniversary, to send more stuff and call them."	musicandtacos	reply	na	na	na	0.08562292903661728	no	no	no	na	relationships
"We've known each other for about eight months now. Heavy online presence in relation to friend groups for context.

I met Z online in an online gaming space, and we hit it off instantly. We're on opposite sides of the country. We started spending some one on one time together and developed feelings for each other. I told Z I was crushing on her because she was talking about how no one has ever confessed to her first a month after we met, and I wanted to make her smile. Z jumped to us 'dating', but I told her no, I would at least want to meet in person before deciding that.

Z started being clingy and asking for my attention constantly. Good night calls, wanting daily game/watching anime time together, etc. I work full time and have a very tight knit friend group with weekly commitments a couple nights a week. Z was unemployed, living off spousal support from her ex-husband, and trying to get a diagnosis for constant chronic pain she was having. 

It was becoming hard to keep up with everything but I wanted to try to, and Z said it was always okay to say no if I didn't have the energy to do something with her, but the way she reacted always made me *feel* guilty. I tried to invite her to do things with my friends and she never wanted to. I had to keep reminding her we were not officially a couple until we met in person in July for an in-person convention we were both attending. She couldn't afford to go to the convention on her own, but I had a spare ticket. I was easily able to cover the cost of her flight, hotel, and the spare ticket. I thought it would be a good first meet, around other people, attending a convention for something we both enjoyed. All I asked was for her to bring spending money for food/souvenirs and I would help cover transportation costs. 

There were some concerns from Z about having to come in a wheelchair, but I told her it was okay and we'd do the best to make it work. The hotel room we were staying in with friends of mine was wheel-chair friendly, I paid extra to be sure. I was bedbound from COVID for awhile back in 2020 and while I couldn't understand Z's situation 100%, I felt like I could understand it better than most people. 

Fast forward to the trip. Z's sleep schedule had always been kind of all over the place, but I asked her to try and fix it before the trip. She told me that wouldn't work and she would manage. I got into the airport a few hours before Z, her flight ended up being delayed, so I ended up going to the hotel, checking in, and making sure the room was actually wheelchair friendly/wash up a bit. Went back to the airport to pick up Z and my two other friends, S and K, who were also attending the convention. Z was quiet and explained she was tired from the flight, which I figured would make sense. When we went back to the hotel room she wanted to sleep immediately and we granted that request, while me, S and K went out to explore the city and grab dinner. 

That ended up being a theme for the entire trip. Z only attended the convention for a couple hours the first day, then headed back to the hotel room by herself to sleep. Z ended up messaging me at the end of the first day that she was too tired to get out of bed and if I could grab her some food on the way back. I said sure, and went back to the hotel room with food for her. Me, S and K were tired from the long day, and passed out pretty quickly. Sometime during the night, Z went out by herself to explore the city, and ended up having to give $50 to a homeless person that took control of her wheelchair without asking her. She didn't tell any of us she was going out, so while this was happening, I woke up in the middle of the night, saw she nor her wheelchair wasn't there, and unsure of what to do when she wouldn't answer my calls/texts. Eventually Z came back an hour after I woke up and told me what happened. I asked her to be more careful and if she wanted to go wander, that's fine, but to let me, S or K know and once of us may be even willing to go with her. 

She didn't do that. Day two of the trip she didn't even intend to go to the convention, and at this point I was starting to get a little upset. I told this to Z privately while S and K had left ahead of me, and Z told me 'if you want to spend time with me you could always stay in the hotel'. I told Z that if I wanted to chill in a room with her, I wouldn't have paid for her to come on this trip, and left. Z ended up asking again for food towards the end of the day, which once again I obliged. When we returned Z was drunk and turns out she went down to the hotel's bar to drink for awhile while we were at the convention. 

S told me to not worry about Z anymore. Day three, we left for the convention, and I told Z to let us know if she needed anything before we picked her up for a concert that evening. She said okay and didn't indicate she needed anything when we picked her up, but she refused to speak to anyone in our group. Eventually I asked her what was going on when we finally got seated for the concert and Z said she hadn't eaten all day and I hadn't even thought to ask her. I was surprised, and told her I thought she had taken care of food by herself for the day considering she had left the hotel room by herself twice already this trip. She said she was in too much pain. I scrambled to find her some food, ended up spending $20 on a pretzel and water, and got her a full meal once we were back near the hotel. 

Z ended up telling me she wanted to remain friends and didn't want to be in a relationship. I was relieved because at this point I didn't want to be either. Z told me she wanted someone to take care of her fully, without having to worry about meeting their needs, and I clearly wanted someone that would take care of me. I told Z that I wanted a partner, not a parent (because that's what it sounded like she wanted to me), and told her I'd prefer to go no contact after the end of the trip. She was offended but agreed, and said she knew that I wouldn't be able to understand all the pain she was in. I told her no, I couldn't, because she was perfectly able to go out twice by herself, but seemed resistant to being around me, S and K.

It's been a couple weeks now and Z is talking to everyone that knows the both of us (and even some people that know just me) about the 'breakup' when we weren't even in a relationship. From what I can tell, Z is trying to make me look like I was trying to leave her 'stranded' as a disabled person, and some people have come to talk to me to ask about what happened. I've even been accused of being manipulative and intentionally putting Z in danger for not getting her food. One of Z's closest friends has suggested I try to talk to her but I want to go firm about going no contact. But the constant questions about what happened and people wanting to hear 'my side' is getting tiring, and I'm not sure what to do at this point. Learned my lesson obviously on paying for someone's vacation, but the gossip is getting tiring.

TLDR: Met a girl online, paid for a vacation w/ her, ended up doing nothing with me the entire vacation. Asked to go no contact but now she's spreading gossip about me and people are coming to me with questions about what happened. Now I'm not sure what to do, how to answer, or even address it."

"I mean, Z sounds like a real handful.

But I also think you've handled this in a way that is going to maximize drama by making it about no contact. It's pretty hard to go no contact with someone in a friend group without causing a whole ton of drama. 

The thing about saying, ""Let's be friends"" is that *you don't have to mean it.* It's the sort of thing that people say *specifically* to minimize drama and allow a more gentle detachment, to avoid bruising feelings. 

In those mutual breakup situations (I mean, she proposed it, which you were happy for!) the best thing to do is to just kind of fade out of each other's lives. 

Who cares if you were officially no contact! It's not like you were going to spend a lot of time engaging with her anyway. 

It sounds a lot like she tried to breakup with you gently and you maybe had to ""win"" the breakup so insisted on no contact, and thus unleashed a whole bunch of drama. I wouldn't be surprised if she's saying what she's saying specifically in retaliation for you making her feel dumped. You offended her *when she offered you an easy out and you rejected it* and well, now, she's lashing out. 

So you're going to have to pay your penance. And that penance is telling your friends your side of the story. Yeah, it's tiring - but you rejected the low-drama exit, so now you have a mess to clean up. So clean it up. 

Why do you care about being ""firm"" about being no contact to begin with? It feels like you're really focused on ""winning"" the break-up (I know it's not really a breakup, but you know what I mean). That's what got you into this mess to begin with."

"I'm not really trying to win, or at least I don't view it that way, but you might be right. I'll try to reflect on it more. 

I wanted to go no contact because I was tired, stressed, and felt like shit. She stressed me out all weekend and made me feel unwanted after I told her I was worried she wasn't going to be interested in me when we finally met, and she assured me that wouldn't happen. 

So I think that was in the back of my mind, and I thought about all the times she made me feel guilty saying no to her, and how I would backtrack and try to compromise when she was disappointed. I thought going no contact would be easier for me, but I see where you're coming from on this. She was trying to let me down gently and I retaliated though that wasn't my intention. 

I'll be honest, I don't have a lot of relationship experience. I dated one guy in my twenties for six years and he cut me off entirely when it was done. So it didn't click to me that 'let's be friends' was potentially just a...low drama way to break up. Thank you for clearing that up for me, I'll keep it in mind in the future."

"Recently went out with a guy twice. We slept together both times. I had a lot of fun, thought he did too, and thought maybe there was a connection there. He said he wanted to see me again and I said great I’d like that too. I reached out a couple times to text him, he responded, and when I suggested meeting up he was busy, so I figured ball was in his court to reach out to me… which of course he never did. I feel dumb for showing interest, and can’t help but feel rejected and wonder if I said or did something wrong. Or if I should have showed less interest? It’s not like he fully ghosted me, because he responded to my texts, but he just kind of faded which feels bad and makes me feel like I messed up?

You slept together too quickly to even figure out if you wanted to go further, it was a mutual booty call scenario.

If you want something serious, date but don't jump into bed with someone until X amount of time.

For example,  date a month or two before even thinking about sleeping with someone and state that boundary up front.  The guys feeling a connection will stick around and those just looking to get laid will drop out.

A friend of mine had a six-month rule, as he was looking for a serious relationship.  He was tired of the guys ditching him after getting laid.

"It’s sh*t. Frankly, there’s not alot you can do. Don’t badger him for a response, you’ve played your hand, and it’s in his court now. 

Does this mean you sit around waiting? Hell no! Enjoy your time for what it was, who knows what will happen. You guys had a good connection (your pov) and thats great, but for whatever reason he’s not responding. 

Go out, find more connections, and fun opportunities. I personally would avoid falling into the trap of “a third date rule” or whatnot, as they bring their own set of issues. Sex is sex. Its fun, it’s connecting. Do you at the end of the day. 

I’m younger than you but literally just got out of this mindset with a guy too. 
We’d been talking for months, eventually met 3 times, slept together twice, then he became distant and stopped reaching out. Looking back now i can see their was an unspoken mutual vibe that it wasn’t “serious “ but i was still down about it after. 

What changed my thinking was looking in retrospect, we had great sexual chemistry but not alot in the everyday and thats okay. I have no regrets, enjoyed my time with him, and had some fun experiences exploring things with him, and it taught me alot about myself. So I would recommend doing some introspection about him and yourself and find the + and -, and chalk it up to an unfortunate situation."	throwashdbe	reply	na	na	na	0.9990301132202148	weak	no	no	na	relationships

This is also my advice. If you want to sleep with someone early on, go for it, just temper your expectations that having sex means the relationship is heading somewhere serious.

"The view that a woman's worth is tied to how many people she has slept with is a view based in misogyny.  
Especially since the same standard isn't socially applied to men.

You can have whatever preference you'd like for your own relationships, but to view someone as less than because they've had sex with a lot of people is shitty. 

Also, the view is based in insecurity usually, people who are bad at pleasing women often try to find ones with less experience so that she won't know any better."	throwashdbe	reply	na	na	na	0.9990301132202148	no	no	no	na	relationships

My advice is to screen potential serious relationship candidates from the casual sex partners.  Sleeping with someone on the first date is her choice, as who cares?  Whatever works for you.

By putting a time or perhaps number of date filter, she gives herself time to see if she is even interested in the guy and whether or not to invest further time.

"Obligatory throwaway account, on mobile, and this will probably be long. TL;DR at the end.

I (30F) have known my boyfriend (31M) for 6 years. We were on and off at the beginning, but have been solidly together for almost 3 years and have been living together a little over 2.

My unhappiness started with our dead bedroom. When we first got together, sex was a huge part of our relationship and it was the best sex I'd ever had. We also had experiences with group sex, hotwifing, swingers clubs, etc. All this to say our sex life was prolific. Shortly before we moved in together things starred slowing down and dry spells got longer and longer. As of now we have not had sex in 9 months. I have brought it up multiple times over the years and be says he is so stressed about other things I'll go on to mention in this post that he doesn't experience sexual desire anymore. He is willing to try if I'm particularly upset about it, but I can feel that he is only doing it out of obligation. It feels gross to be asking for sex from someone I already know doesn't want it. 

He has pretty severe ADHD and clinical depression. He has done well on medication in the past but let his prescriptions lapse a few years ago. He is unable to make himself pursue another psychiatrist to talk about getting treatment again. 

The biggest physical issue is his teeth. He had shoddy braces when he was younger and developed cavities under them. He didn't stay on top of that either and is now in need of serious dental work. His parents have offered to help him pay for it, but he still can't make himself seek treatment. He gave up after calling one dentist that didn't return his call. He now doesn't take care of his teeth at all, as in does not brush or use mouthwash, and I am now grossed out to the point where I don't like kissing him let alone doing anything else involving mouths...

He is in roughly $25k of credit card debt, which I know could be worse, but the majority of his money is going towards those payments without actually making any progress. This wouldn't be so bad if he didn't also want to eat out all the time and spend money on his fixation hobbies, then stress out about money. 

There are still good things here. We have fun when we do things together, he is still affectionate, we make each other laugh, and I *love* his family. But it feels like he let himself go because I moved in and he thinks he's locked me down. I chased him for so long at the beginning that it's hard to want to give up, but maybe I'm falling prey to the sunken cost fallacy.

"TL;DR I have never had a relationship an I feel it’s down to the fact I am disabled. 

So I’m a 21M who has never been in a relationship or anything as much as a hug from a woman or lost my v-card. I see my friends with girlfriends and know I am ready for that chapter of my life to begin. The common denominator out of me and my friends is that I am a full time wheelchair user and cannot walk at all (it’s freidrichs ataxia for those who want more information). I feel like women don’t see me as a viable partner due to my disability, as if I am not strong enough or physically capable of being a partner. I don’t know? Or they see me as a cute little guy who needs to be taken care of. I DO NOT I lead a pretty independent life. I feel like I I wasn’t disabled I wouldn’t have trouble getting a girlfriend, I’m a nice respectful guy, I have a degree in music production, so I’m not stupid. I am a DJ, producer and I play bass and guitar in my band. So I’m not boring but I don’t know. I feel like society puts so much pressure on younger men to lose their virginity asap and her loads of girls but that is definitely not the case for me. Maybe I’m not as great as I thought. Some advice and guidance would be appreciated."	Pricetag999	post	27.30427108381867	female	White	0.981904923915863	na	na	na	6	relationships
"My advice is don't sweat the wheelchair at all. I've totally matched with hot dudes with wheelchairs on dating apps before, it did not stop me at all.

I also had many male friends with zero disabilities who didn't lose the V card until 23+. There's no timer on this thing, it happens when it happens! You sound like a catch, so get out there and start dating. If anyone's weird to you over a disability, that's just the trash taking itself out."

">I feel like I I wasn’t disabled I wouldn’t have trouble getting a girlfriend

I feel like this line sums up your issues:

1. **You're hyper-focused on your disability and use it as a shield to avoid addressing your character flaws because it's easier that way** \- it's safer to say that you're not where you want to be because of no fault of your own than it is to look at yourself honestly and assess where you could be doing better. For example, how do you know it's your disability that's put women off you? How do you know it isn't some other aspect of your character that you could work on improving, like your confidence and self-esteem? You choose to believe it's your disability because being disabled is outside of your control, whereas fixing your personality flaws requires scarily honest introspection and a conscious effort to do better.
2. **You're desperate and desperation is not attractive to any woman, especially not one worth having.** You say you want ""a girlfriend"" as though any woman will do, just as long as you have a woman to call your girlfriend. Nobody - male or female - wants to feel like they're interchangeable or there to serve you. Do you know what kind of person you'd like to be with, e.g. what sort of personality traits you desire, what sort of behaviours you would or would not accept etc? I suggest thinking about these things so you can be selective in your choices. Don't think you have a right to be selective because you're disabled??? See point 1 above. But remember that women also have a right to be selective in their choice of partner too. So, if your disability is a deal breaker for some women, then that's perfectly fine because they're obviously not the right woman for you. You're not looking for any woman, you're looking for *your* woman. Your woman won't be put off by you being disabled because she is, by definition, meant for *you*.

&#x200B;

My (35 F) partner (33 M) is physically disabled (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) and he came into our relationship with a lot more experience than I did. By the time we'd met, I was a virgin who'd not been kissed until I was 32 and had a ton of short-lived dating experiences; he'd lost his virginity in university, had a long-term relationship and some one-night stands. One of the first things that attracted me to him was his confidence both in relation to his disability and in general.

So, if any of the above seems unduly harsh, it's because I'm speaking from a place of knowing that your assumptions are not correct.

"Hello everyone!  
I thought I received a ban on Pokemon Go. A few hours after submitting a post on PokemonGo, I received an e-mail with a confirmation of my account deletion. I immediately responsed, trying to cancel this request but Niantic has yet to respond to me. I'll provide a bit clearer of the story of events that transpired the day before yesterday, and today as well.  
I started seeing a guy about a month ago as we both played Pokemon Go and he was seemingly playing as much as me, so we both thought it would be a good match! The day before yesterday, he was fairly upset at me over pursuing a romance in Baldur's Gate 3 and mentioning it to him. I personally thought it was silly and I wasn't really ok continuing to be with someone who will get upset over CPU romances, seeing as I play games like Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon as well, where these are also present. He had asked me to come over, and I said fine.  
At his house, he apologized to me for acting that way, and also explained he doesn't want to argue about these things. I thanked him for the apology, we did some trades before bed as we typically get lucky trades often, and went to sleep.  
I woke up around 7 am and he was already up and about. I had heard him get out of bed earlier, and he mentioned he woke up at 6, so it must have been around this time. We are talking a bit and he shows me that an Illumise spawned, so I hop on myself and catch the Illumise. I then put the phone away to spend some time with him as he is heading out of town until Thursday, just a few days.  
Around an hour later, at 8:30, I check Pokemon Go again before I intended on leaving his place. I received a ban notification on my screen saying I've been banned permanently. Now, to me this is weird. I never used any third party apps, programs, or accessories. I don't spoof either. I used an official Pokemon Go Plus (old one) that was previously linked to a different account, but that couldn't be it either. I kind of brushed it off thinking it was a mistake, I said oh well, I'll submit a ban appeal and they'll see I've done nothing wrong. My partner though, he was pretty upset about it. I had never seen him cry previous to this as we have only been together a month, but he burst into tears and explained I'm the only partner who has played PoGo with him. I consoled him, told him it would be ok, its just a ban and I can appeal it, and we both went on our way. Him to work, and myself to my place.  
I was looking up any possible way that I could've been banned, as Niantic is finicky with bans as I'm finding out. I was researching all day to see if I might've done something weird or anything, as I've always played cleanly with no assistance, with the exception of that one time pokemon go plus official accessory.  
Now here is where it gets odd to me.... at 8 pm, I receive an e-mail confirmation on my account deletion, and that it will be processed. That's incredibly strange as I never submitted anything... I read the full conversation and see there was an account deletion submission at 6:30 am this morning. But I was asleep... I dug a bit deeper and found that the deletion code is generic (at least it was the same yesterday for my friend attempting to submit an account deletion request). So the code you need to send to Niantic is generic, in order to permanently delete an account. This raised some red flags and I was concerned maybe someone did it out of spite. I looked into this further and checked all my phone activity on all email accounts set up on my phone... And there it was.  
At 6:24 am someone had opened my Twitter/X. I had sent a frustration message to one of my best friends explaining that I don't think this relationship can work out if he will act like this. Now, when I woke up, there was no notification they replied to me. My PC was also off, as I know sometimes Twitter will mark messages as read if you have a Twitter tab open. So this led me to believe the following:  
\- My partner read my Twitter notification DM from my friend- My partner panicked or got angry.- He then went thru all my messaging apps to check to see if he could find something? My only guess is that he thought Wyll from Baldurs Gate was a real person, or if I said anything to anyone else. This was done in a matter of a minute per messaging app.- He opened my Pokemon go at 6:29 am and submitted the deletion request, as it can only be done via the app as far as I understand.- My gmail was opened at 6:31 am and this is when the deletion request was received (6:30 am). It was replied to at 6:32 am.- The emails were deleted and removed from the trash so I would not see them- I only ended up seeing it thanks to Niantic's automated messaging to confirm my account deletion will be processed.- I messaged Niantic back immediately after receiving the confirmation at 8 pm to cancel this request.  
I'm not entirely sure how else any of this could have happened, I have zero history of sleep walking or sleep... using my phone. I need any and all advice possible here, trainers. Is it still possible that the account deletion can be cancelled? I cannot entirely confirm it was him, I've directly asked him and he says he wouldn't do this, I'm his main Pokemon Go partner to play with.  
TLDR; I thought I got banned, turns out an account deletion request was submitted thru my phone when I was asleep. Is it reversible?"	RamuneLive	post	30.728093753789796	female	White	0.9986133575439453	na	na	na	7	relationships

So this is a recent relationship and we've been dating for 6 months. My boyfriend isn't really an expressive person or doesn't show affection (either with words or physical touch) but I do feel like he shows his appreciation through his actions (making and bringing me coffee in the morning, ordering food if I'm not feeling like cooking or if I'm starving. Always there if I need help with something. Helping around the house I own.) However, a few weeks ago I went to the mall with my boyfriend and he's got really worn out shoes and we always make fun of them. Lots of people makes fun of them too cause they're just so old and out of style. He was looking between two pairs and almost bought one of them but then didn't end up doing it.

Yesterday, I went to his place and brought the box with him and when I went inside his room. I placed the box on the bed in front of him (he was on his phone) and then I told him I got something. He just looked at it and didn't say anything and then I said it's the shoes he wanted so then he just looked at the box and smiled and then said that he'll be able to use the other one as back up (while remaining on his phone). Then he went on to plug his laptop to his tv so he could play YouTube and then just placed the box on the floor and didn't even open it or even tried them. I don't expect anything in return but I was just a bit disappointed that he didn't even really acknowledge it and looked at itor at least say thank you.

Later, we decided to go out and I asked if he wanted to try them on cause I'll return them if he doesn't fit and if he wanted to wear them while we're out. He asked me if I got his size and then said that if I had his size then it was fine and doesn't need to try them on and he didn't want to wear them yet cause he'd rather wear his old shoes until he can't (to the pont there's holes and falling apart)

Any thoughts? Or advice?


TLDR; I (25f) bought my bf (25m) a gift and he didn’t acknowledge or open it. I feel disappointed. It was a pair of shoes he really liked at the store and wanted them for a while but didn't get them so I bought them for him and surprised him yesterday with them.

"Not really. I wanted to buy the new shoes cause he's been saying for so long he wanted a new pair. He's the one that jokes about the shoes (they're sandals).

I honestly don't care of what he wears as long as he's happy about it (and I've told him that a few times already)I just wanted to be thoughtful and get him something I thought he'd be happy because he had mentioned it a lot in the last month (it was that or something else but I'm keeping that for his birthday). 

He did not say thank you. He placed the box aside and kept going about the stuff he was watching on YouTube.

I honestly don't mind if he doesn't wear them yet. It was mostly really due to the fact that he didn't acknowledge it or said thank you. Even if it ended up something he doesn't like and tells me that's not for him or doesn't like it, I would've been fine with that and returned it and selected a different brand or color or just something else completly)."

"I'm going to try and keep it short but there is alot of context here and I want to give enough information.

Let me back up a little on how we got here. Me and Bf moved out together last year. I felt unsure about it since at the time I was working for doordash and he made the most money. He covered rent and most bills for the first couple of months it was heaven, I LOVED living with him but then he lost his job. I got a decent paying job but it required me to travel and it was mostly commision (I'm not that great in sales) then our cars started to have issues so my bf got a local job at a grocery store and I moved to work from home with a sizeable pay cut. Long story short he lost that job and we could no longer afford rent. We took a lot of debt and we both moved into my moms as his family wanted to charge him rent twice as much as my mom. I'm not saying it was all his fault as we are both terrible at saving but it made me frustrated that he couldn't hold a job

Fast forward a couple months and I won't go into the details but he lost his current job and got into legal trouble it's his first offense so it may not be that serious but it could also result in jail time. this is my tipping point... I'm tired of being too poor to afford anything and so stressed i want to scream. I want to join the military for multiple reasons but obviously I'm not marrying him with this current situation... I don't want to break up because he is my best friend and has been there for me a lot but at this rate there is not even anything I can do to help him other than provide emotional support. And if I join the military it'll be long distance.  He's been depressed since us living at my moms and he has already told me multiple times since I've bailed him that I can kick him out or break up with him. I assured him I didn't want to break up I just wanted him to get his crap together but I'm starting to think that I'm in over my head and need to focus on myself. 

TL DR:I (22 f) have been considering joining the military for the past couple of months really ever since I moved back in with my mom. Me and my (25 m) boyfriend have been dating for 6 years but recently he got into legal trouble that is making me reconsider our whole relationship."

Pretty much nobody is still together at 25 with the person they were dating at 16. It's okay to be done with the relationship just because you're done with it.

"This might be long so thanks in advance if you read it through.

I (26F) have been dating my boyfriend (26M) for the roughly 3 years. I've had a lot of sexual partners but he was the first person I feel I could say I truly fell in love with. 

The start of our relationship was so nice and like nothing I've felt before. From our first date we had instant chemistry. It was so easy to talk to him and both of us really enjoyed being around each other. He was different back then. He took better care of himself, did more during the week, and in general we did more together as a result.

About 6-ish months in is when I first noticed some yellow flags. He got really drunk one night while out. I was staying over his place and was waiting anxiously for him to come home. He finally did (shitfaced, mind you) at like 4am and he had fucked himself up by falling or something. He could barely move his body and he was drunkenly groaning in pain throughout the night. I was worried but it seemed like a one off dumb occurrence. 

He never went to the doctor because he doesnt have insurance so he just let everything heal and hoped for the best. He does this any time he gets hurt or sick. He has some long-term issues that are just left unresolved as a result.

He tends to put things off until they become disastrous. That same year in the winter (which was like 20F on some days) his utilities got shut off because he received multiple notices about scheduling an inspection and he just ignored them. He had no heat for about a month and because of this his hygiene fell. I was annoyed at him for causing the situation because I was worried and felt bad for him. But I was still attracted to him because I loved him and wanted to support him through that.

We ended up moving in together after around a year. It was okay at first but then we got a dog. I quickly became the primary caretaker of the dog. He pays for stuff but grooming and walking are almost never done by him. He occasionally feeds him.

Part of the reason for this is that he sleeps for most of the day. He's works nights but he only works like 3 days a week. He literally will sleep for 12-14 hours at a time. I am not exaggerating. This means there are days when we are both home that we just don't see each other. He didnt do this as much when we first met because his schedule was different. We would meet up throughout the week, go to parks, and do things outside. Now we barely do anything together because he would rather sleep. I try to wake him up but it's draining because he fights me the whole way, which makes me feel like a nuisance. 

He got drunk and fucked himself up on the week of our 3yr anniversary so we didnt celebrate until months later. It was extremely traumatic because he didn't come home for half a day and when he did he was covered in blood. Something snapped in me that day and my mental health has spiraled downward since then. I'm finally doing better but I havent been working as much as a result.

The thing is, I love his good qualities. I have on/off depression and take medication. When it's gotten to be a lot for me he has stepped up. He is kind-hearted as well, but also really judgmental of people which I dislike. He's cuddly and sweet though and wants to support me. 

He cares about me but it feels like he doesnt care about impressing me anymore. He literally told me he's gotten comfortable with me. He's not trying as hard. I don't deserve that because I'm actively trying to work on my own shit and him not working on his is making my mental health so much worse. I have a history of addiction and when we met I was sober. It is so hard to stay sober dating someone like this. I feel neglected and frustrated and unappreciated. And every time he has an accident I go crazy with worry. It is unhealthy.

I deserve someone who takes care of themself and loves themself. He can barely offer me emotional support because he's drowning in his own stuff. And thats okay on its own but I feel like its unfair to date someone and then let your mental and physical health just plummet for years. It is extremely painful and sad because I cant do anything to help him. Ive tried so much and I feel like it's pointless since he doesn't want my help. 

All this has made me apathetic to some of his problems because he always has the same issues since he doesn't address them. I get tired of hearing the same shit all the time. I'm less attracted to him now. I don't want to kiss him as much. I like having sex with him but it doesnt feel as intimate for me now and my eyes are closed more often. It just feels good. Thats it.

Our lease is up next July and I want to wait out breaking up with him till at least December/January because I want to figure out how I can leave and definitely dont want to do it in the Winter but cant afford to now. I know my family will help but I dont want to move in with them. I take better care of the dog but can't afford him on my own. I know the dog's quality of life will be worse without me there to do the extra shit. I don't have enough money to pay for a place. Right now Im trying to focus on getting therapy and finding a different job. 

I also am trying to give him (another) chance... I do love him. But I have to go. This isn't sustainable for me. I want it to be amicable as I feel like we could be friends (I still am friends with a former partner and dont really have ill will against my current one). I honestly wouldnt mind breaking up but being roommates for a bit while searching for another place. Part of me feels like an idiot for still dating him now even though I'm trying to do things in a way that isn't going to make me homeless or even more mentally unstable. 

What should I do? Am I doing this right? Ive talked to him about some of these issues without bringing up a break up multiple times. He says he's struggling but he wont get psych help. And yes he is depressed and he said he has always been that way. Is it shitty to leave him this way?

tl;dr: Im falling out of love with my long-term boyfriend and need advice on what to do next as we live together but Im too broke to leave right now."	havingtroublexisting	post	20.55419187164623	female	White	0.007857873104512691	na	na	na	1	relationships

"Tl;dr gf brought up penis size twice in front of large group of friends. I don't care to be in social situations with her anymore.

We have been together for over 10 years and have a child together. When covid started, I was scrambling to buy us a camper and got it the day before our state shut down, we put it on a permanent site at a resort and have been there every weekend since, have met alot of people who are like a second family to us now.
Her only hobby is getting drunk and socializing with our camper family, so much so that they named her drunk alter ego. Now I've met and left this alter ego twice before our child was born, and things settled down before  we got the camper. 
So the 1st incident there were probably 20 of our camper friends at a campfire and somehow penis talk came up, and she shouts out that I have a small penis (my penis is actually above average in length and girth but my big frame doesn't do it justice and I am definitely a big time grower). Some one must have told her to hush up and she just replied ""what, he don't care"". Well I did care and was furious with her bringing that up in front of everyone, I talked about it with her the next day sober and said if she did it again we'd probably be done.
Well it just happened again same scenario at the campfire with the same people, not sure of the context of the conversation but all I heard was her say ""6""s he ain't got 6""s no way he's got 6""s laughing hysterically and others were too, I just told her she should learn to read a ruler and went to bed for the night.
I was irate the next day and basically told her I've always hated her alter ego and I've left her in the past because of it.
It's just so hard to think about since we have a child together, that's really the only reason I'm not gone right now. I don't and probably won't do anything with her socially for a long time, we have  concerts coming up we were supposed to go to together and I just don't want anything to do with her right now."

Be open and honest with how her behavior makes you feel and draw a hard boundary that you won't be around her when she's been drinking etc. I wouldn't stay with someone for the sake of your kid as that will set them up with a very bad example of what relationships should look like.

"So my fiancé & I used to text all the time and was very excited about each-other of course. I can be a texter, caller, any of that stuff if I like somebody enough. I text him more often than he texts me. Even if he does text me now, I am still eager to respond. Both of us have had job changes, but I know that he currently loves his job and everything about it. 

We see each other every weekend and in between sometimes as well due to jobs, but other than that, we don’t talk much if we aren’t hanging out. 

For example, he used to send good morning and good night texts. Now, I get zero…unless we are texting about something random (not very often) and one of us finally says that we’re going to bed. So none of that out of the blue. I send him texts the most, and he will just forget to look at them or respond to them. He’s always on his phone though, watching Instagram reels and YouTube videos. He always has his phone in his hand. 

He will call me for a bit before I go to work, but we don’t really talk on the phone because he is either drifting off to sleep, hanging up the call to go eat with his parents, or watching Instagram reels. Occasionally we will get a meaningful conversation out of it. Right when that phone hangs up, I usually don’t hear anything from him until the next day when he calls me before work again.

I guess what I’m asking is, is this behavior normal? Is he just extremely low maintenance? He says he’s not big into texting, but he definitely used to be at the beginning of our relationship. 

Any advice?? 

TL;DR: Fiancé & I used to text all the time for the first year of dating. Now, he only calls me before I go to work and we don’t get much meaningful conversation out of it. I won’t hear from him until the next day until he calls me again before work. I’ll text him every once in a while, but he rarely responds instantly and sometimes even forgets to look at them.

"I think it's okay, but I'd recommend you keep the points *very brief.*

Don't write a script. Don't use full sentences. Just a few points to help jog your memory.

Don't write anything that assumes you know what her problems are, her wants, or her thoughts. Don't write down anything you'd be uncomfortable with her seeing. Everything you write should be about you.

If you use too many words, and try to get them just right, you may come across as insincere, or too locked into your own perspective. You cannot go in with 'a plan' or you'll be unable to hear her when she speaks and respond to the conversation that is actually happening. You need to be flexible."

"Perfectly valid. If this is you and your ways, and if this helps to forward the discussion, go right ahead.

I would recommend though, that you rather do it in a more moderation card style. With keywords or rather key sentences. This helps you greatly to speak your thoughts fluently. A text is too clumsy and reading off of it is distracting and bad for a vivid conversation. With cards you can discuss single points or accept questions and then come back and continue your speech. With a text this is very difficult.

If you want to prove to her you can change, make the change and stick with it. I assume these are things that are good for you in general or will be key in any future relationship, so stop worrying about convincing others and make changes for the better for yourself.

I think it's fine, especially if the notes are just for yourself to make sure you say what you want, and it's not like youre handing her a desperate love letter.  The best thing to do is keep it EXTREMELY short. It would really dominate the conversation and give her too much to respond to, without giving her a chance to express own thoughts, if she's got to digest and thoughtfully give her perspective on like an entire typed page. Also, in an emotionally charged situation, at least for myself, not all of my thoughts are helpful to share with the other person, but they're really easy to write down, so that often leads to me introducing information to the talk that's not useful or even actively harmful. However, if you're really forcing yourself to condense your feelings, you'll be narrowing into the most important things and less likely to say something stupid	MeeMeeGod	reply	na	na	na	0.0075697218999266624	weak	no	no	na	relationships

"I've been with my gf roughly 4 years, we've been living together for most of that time. For the first 2 years we'd have sex or be physical in some way very often. All of it was amazing, we both constantly agreed best and most fun we'd ever had. For the last 2 years maybe sex has basically disappeared. We've talked about it often, but now she just has a low libido. Or at least that's just the answer I've been given lately. There a plenty of outside factors during that time that easily caused a ton of stress. These could have contributed to the intimacy issue. However in my mind if one of us has a problem and communicates that problem, yet it still continues for that amount of time. That itself seems like an issue to me as I now have constant feeling of being unloved, and ignored. Which I've brought up to her many times, just to be met with ""low libido"", and ""I will work on it"". It doesn't help I've recently had surgery, so I'm kind of stuck in the house 24/7 and she has said she's afraid she'd hurt me. The doctor had said just don't do anything that hurts and it's a non-issue. It just always feels like there's some excuse as to why she can't or won't have sex. This year we've had sex twice, with me speaking up about it countless times. My last long term relationship began its downward spiral in a very similar fashion. I'm not sure what to do here. I don't think she's cheating. But I also know I've communicated it clearly and calmly for what I consider a long time. At this point I am getting a little nasty with her at times, in a relationship where I don't think we had ever fought before. We've always been crazy open and honest with each other. I'm just at a loss right now. Any advice would be appreciated

Has she talked to her doctor or a therapist about her libido issues? The two of you need to communicate about this and come up with ways you're both working through this, otherwise if you keep bringing it up and she keeps not doing anything, it's not going to change and it shows she isn't willing to put in effort to meeting your needs.

"I mean I've brought it up countless times. Not meaning constantly badgering for sex, but ""hey, this has been an issue for me. this is how its making me feel. I really think we need to address this because it's becoming a bigger issue for me the longer this continues"". That was what I remember saying last week. As far as talk therapy, we have spoken about it. She has said she intends to start, I encouraged it (not solely for this, but I feel it would benefit her regarding the other outside issues). I'm not sure if there's some outside issue that's causing this, or if for whatever reason the relationship is over. Maybe she's just done with me, maybe she's cheating (tho I have no other reasons to suspect that), or maybe some outside issue is affecting her and she's in a ""funk"". I'm leaning towards funk, and I want to help. But I've done all I can think of, the only thing left is to just encourage therapy. Due to my own history I don't entirely trust my gut here. I've never been so in love or felt so connected to someone, so I'm not in a rush to condemn the relationship, and she still tells me she loves me and will want to cuddle and watch tv at the end of the day.

Like I said, she needs to demonstrate that she is willing to work on this. People go through periods of low libido for a million reasons (depression, hormonal imbalance, stress) that aren't related to you or your relationship- though it's also possible maybe she is losing attraction to you specifically or having doubts, but either way, the reason doesn't matter as long as she is willing to try things. Sometimes it's difficult to get in to see a therapist, but at the end of the day if she cares enough about you and keeping the relationship, she will do what it takes. If she doesn't at least show you that she wants to make progress and is open to things, then it's over	Alillostrightmeow	reply	na	na	na	0.9981909394264221	no	no	no	na	relationships
That all sounds very reasonable.  I appreciate your input. As of right now I plan to try to continue being supportive, while also making my concerns clear. If nothing else I want her to be okay. If we're together or not I will always love her. I will try to talk to her about it again soon. I don't want to seem like i'm just coming down on her and complaining nonstop. I want to help, but I also want to keep our relationship going in the right direction.

"My (27F) boyfriend (27M) and I have been together for 7 months and I’m still not fully convinced that he’s healed from his previous long-term relationship, which ended almost 5 years ago. There are a bunch of reasons why which I’ll omit for the sake of brevity.

What I’m really wondering is: let’s say my gut is right and that he isn’t quite over her yet... why is that inherently bad? I have plenty of evidence (and he has reassured me many times) that he is genuinely happy in our relationship and confident in what we have. And I have every reason to believe him. So why should it even bother me that he might have a “one who got away” complex? Just like, on a philosophical level lol.

I mean, I’m a proponent of the idea that loss is loss. The break up was traumatic for him, and when it comes to trauma, you don’t “get over” it, you get through it. 

TL;DR, isn’t it possible to start a new relationship before you’ve healed from an old one? Couldn’t you give yourself grace and space to work through things, process, heal, grow, and discover what you actually need in a relationship, while embracing a new one for what it’s worth (ig as long as you’re honest and transparent with your partner about how the old one affected you?)

There's a difference between not being completely over the trauma of a rough breakup versus not being completely over the PERSON. If it's the not healed from trauma situation, that can be worked on, though it could contribute to issues in your relationship - if he was cheated on, he might be extra jealous or controlling and insecure in that area, if he was lied to he might be suspicious or hesitant to fully commit, etc. But he can work through it with therapy and understanding/support from you. However if he's still in love with his ex, that is a different situation. Thinking that she's the one who got away makes it sound like he's not over her and some part of him wishes they were still together- that's not fair to you if that's the case.	wikiwutlol309	reply	na	na	na	0.011080591008067131	no	no	no	na	relationships

"Like it says in the title, I'm struggling right now with my relationship and what to do about it. 

My common law spouse and I have been together for 8 years and do not have any children, nor do we want to. We have two cats together and a vehicle, but no other shared assets. He is cisgender and heterosexual, I am queer (I like any gender, it isn't something that matters to me). 

Our relationship is healthy and we have great communication, we have small disagreements about things occasionally but not about anything other than just general daily life things (laundry or dishes, small stuff). We have regular sex, not as frequently now as we did in the beginning, but once a week on average sometimes more sometimes less. We have discussed legal marriage but neither of us has felt the need to do that nor do we care about a wedding, neither of us want to do that either. 

It's really the perfect situation, which is why I'm struggling. 

We got together when I was 21, I had graduated from university and he was into his career. Neither of us was looking for a relationship at the time but were pleasantly surprised by how well we fit together. We have alignment on nearly all of our politics and values, and he was a little immature for his age whereas I was more mature for my age at the time (due to trauma and then therapy etc). We have been so mutually supportive of each other's goals over our relationship and have gotten through some really tough times with each others support. 

Now the issue, I have come to realise that I want to have sex with other people and practice non monogamy with him as my life partner. I want him to have that freedom and explore his sexuality and external physical relationships with others as well. I don't know if polyamory (like additional bf or gf relationships) is what I want, rather I just want to explore some FWB situations. 

We have had a couple of pretty frank conversations about it and come to an impasse on it. Basically, he doesn't want to sleep with other people and isn't sold on the idea for me. I don't think it's something to sell him on, he either is comfortable with it or not. It's not something I feel I have to do, but I also feel kind of resentful of it already and don't know what to do. 

This is the only long term serious relationship I've been in and I don't want to throw away what we have just to sleep with someone else. I don't have anyone in mind, I just travel a lot for one of my hobbies and have had people try to pick me up a couple of times which I have shut down quick because I am not comfortable with going behind my partners back on things. I'm not scared to be single and I actually really like being alone, but I also love him so so much and am still deeply in love with him. I don't want another partnership, I just want to explore my sexuality more. 

I just don't know how to handle this at all and where to go from here. 

TLDR: I (30F) want to explore non-monogamous sexual experiences but my partner (39M) doesn't. I don't want to break up and don't want another life partner."	butt_dagget	post	30.7929375576621	female	White	0.006415461655706167	na	na	na	2	relationships
Well the only way to handle it is to choose. Reddit is going to give you lots of different answers about what to do (\*cough\*couples therapy), but only you know what you want deep down. But one exercise I find fun is to try and look at your relationship in a new lens. What made you fall in love with your partner in the first place? Could you do it all over again? Do something new! Go on a trip! Have fun! After you've tried to give monogamy another shot (or couples therapy), then you'll know which one you really want. Or maybe you already know and just don't want to make choice yet. Good luck!	butt_dagget	reply	na	na	na	0.006415461655706167	no	no	no	na	relationships

"So my (F24) bf (M24) and I have been together for over 2 years but have known each other for 5. He’s honestly close to perfect and treats me so well and cares about me and loves me so much and I know that. The issue is his response to conflict which is great most of the time but ever now and then he goes into complete avoidant stonewalling kinda thing and literally behaves like a different person. 

An example:
He needs to get a job so we can find a house to move into but he needs to do his cv and he’s been quite lazy with it and only doing it when I say something or question why he isn’t even after me bringing it up a few times. So today we were gonna go on for walk and I was thinking about plans for the day and how he promised to get his bc done by tomorrow so I started trying to explain to him how I feel about him not doing it and how it makes me feel like he thinks I’ll just believe whatever he says without him changing his actions. I was trying to explain it in detail but he wasn’t saying anything and said that there’s no reason to because I don’t believe him apparently. Then he said he’s going on his walk and ignored me being upset, I got more upset and started crying a bit and he just says “ I’m going you don’t seem like you wanna go” and left. I tried texting him two hours after to say that it hurt me and to offer to meet out but he ignored me. I went out to a shop and bumped into him on the way home and he said he was annoyed he had to walk past me and that he wants to be alone because he’s never alone and “we’re all good” but when I said that I love him he asked “really” with a smirk and said that he’s going off for a walk and that I should go home. 

I tried apologizing and emphasizing that I love him and didn’t want him to feel unloved but nothing, I’m just ignored and it’s time bc he wants to be alone which is a normal thing (it is only if you don’t just do that after an argument). So now I’m meant to respect his needs whilst mine aren’t and honestly it blows my mind because he behaves like a different person and I don’t know what I’ve done. Is there a way to solve this? Do I need to change something?

"F19 M48: broke up with my gf because of her BPD, am I in the wrong?

I broke up with my girlfriend because she was manic and I didn’t know she had bipolar

I started dating this girl and a few weeks into it she told me she loved me and started acting very manic —- then she blocked me and a week later unblocked me to text me from the hospital and let me know that she blocked me because someone told her I had a girlfriend…

I didn’t visit her in the hospital and shortly after I told her I wasn’t ready for a relationship. We continued to text after and I stopped responding as much eventually and started to avoid her.

 it was a lot for me to deal with and I really did love her as well but it was just a lot, I told her I wasn’t ready for a relationship but she keeps texting me. 

She’s only 19 and I’m 48 and I didn’t know she was 19 when we first met … it was at a techno party and I ended up giving her some mdma and we hit it off and slept together the same night.

She didn’t look 19 at all and she had her own apartment and job so she was pretty independent but it makes me feel a bit weird as well.

 I 29 (f) and my boyfriend 36 (m) have been dating officially for 3 months. We met at work and he is one of my supervisors. He does rotations and I work steady days. His childhood friend also works with us but in the office. I'm not typically the jealous type. So when my boyfriend and I were seeing each other on the down low I made the effort to befriend, let's name her Chelsea. At first it was going great. Until we officially became an item. She began to nit pick on everything I did and would pull tantrums if things did not go her way. The first time she lashed out at me, I concluded that she was just having a bad day. As time progressed things just got worse. She started talking down to me like she was my superior and as if I was simply incompetent. I spoke to my boyfriend about this and he assures me that should she try something he would stop it. I trust him but I also know he is oblivious to women flirting or making a pass at him. What bothers me the most is the fact that she mistreat others who associate with me. I'm at a loss on what to do. Should I just leave it be or should I confront her?

Should she try what? Making a move on him, or further insulting you? If its the later, then surely he should be doing something to stop it right now.

The way she is treating you is NOT okay at all, and if you expressed this with your boyfriend, he should be the one to understand your feelings, and do something about it (since she is HIS friend). He should not be dismissing the fact she talks down on you, and others associated with you, and throws tantrums and makes you feel inferior. Why is he not doing anything about this right now?

The ""her treating you nice when he's around"" is a classic catty-mean girl move. To be honest, I would assert yourself to her without getting over-zealous or passive aggressive. Just mirror her behaviors to you, unless she \*is\* your superior, professionally... In that case, just file a complaint (since it is an abuse of power). 

How involved is she with your relationship? Why would she have a say in ""anything"" if she is not also his girlfriend? That's whats going on, you feel like you are competing with her emotionally even though they are just good friends. Regardless, imo, if you continue on with him- he should recognize these patterns of behavior from his friend, as long as you keep your cool and don't bring it up (he will think you'e being jealous and crazy).

You've only been with him 3 months, so the relationship is new to him. The best thing you can do is be yourself and not give other women power over your emotions through your bf. If you get more serious with him, in time, he will for sure prioritize you over other women in his life... If he doesn't, then boy bye."

Honestly, I didn't know what I should be expecting from him. He asked if I wanted him to stop talking to her. I knew that wasn't something I could ask of him. In hindsight, I guess I lowkey wanted him to speak to her on my behalf. I did not know if that was something I had to do first before requesting his assistance on the matter.

Tbh, if he doesn't recognize these patterns or prioritize you in the future, I wouldn't blame him. If he doesn't recognize it now, he won't recognize it later (unless you say something, or point it out). And laying low, staying quiet, and waiting till you spontaneously see a change is damaging imo. Some guys are dense and need some guidance - that's okay. Expressing your emotions (in a civil manner) is crucial to setting boundaries, and if he finds that you are jealous or crazy, then clearly the point is missed and he is the problem.

"Both myself (M28) and my partner (F25) would be by medical standards considered obese. I only met her about 4 months ago, but we are now like glue and have an awesome relationship. One thing I was undergoing when I met her is a desire to take back control of my eating habits, my activity levels, and my overall health. We both have been diagnosed with ADHD. It can be very difficult for people with ADHD to maintain focus on well maintaining themselves. Showering, brushing teeth, remembering to intake a decent level of water, doctor, and dentist appointments. You name it.

I guess I'm asking yall  if I would be considered a ""Groomer"" for trying to pull my partner together in terms of caring for themselves. I have stressed a small amount on diet and exercise but it's something we both knew we had wrong that needed attention if we were going to spend as much time as possible together in the long run. And set a good example for our future children. I didn't coax her to say these things I was just talking about it and she asked me what I was doing and how I wanted to do it and she agreed to join me on the journey. Although I must also include she had dealt with depression alot earlier in life and was now really garnering a positive attitude towards wanting to correct hardships she was facing that made her feel that way. I had somewhat early on in our relationship let her know I was doing this to be the best version of myself and that I wanted to help her overcome her troubles. Im just hoping I wasnt too pushy and shes doing this for my approval.

So far we are both working on it. Turkey bacon and sausage egg whites. Rice and chicken for dinners. We still have our occasional dinners out where we don't sit and count calories. 


I should also mention she has an autoimmune disease and PCOS that will both vastly improve her quality of life if she can get them under control by lowering her BMI. We can't have kids as it is right now as being a larger person with PCOS really hinders ovulation.  

I know it's gonna take time, and I'm more than willing to be patient as I said I'm still losing the weight as well and improving myself in alot of ways too. I've just managed to get down a routine for exercise, dental and other hygiene, and buckled down on counting out calories. She's been really good with it for the most part and shows no signs of unhappiness over the fact that I've been trying to push her to better herself. But I guess I want a strangers opinion.

TLDR: 4 month old relationship. Both overweight. Both ADHD I (28M) managed to figure our a routine for facing ongoing hygiene and health issues and have been encouraging my partner (25F) to do the same. Am I a Jerk?"

the term 'gr\*\*mer' is used to describe someone who preys on children/ younger people, so I would not use that term here! But no, you have not pressured her - you told her what you wanted to do, and encouraged her that you both need to be healthy to live a long life and have children. She willingly agreed and is doing what she wants, which is something she probably would have done anyway given her health issues. In fact, I would say this is being a great partner.

By this logic, are you a bad person for not helping somebody become healthier?

>She's been really good with it for the most part and shows no signs of unhappiness over the fact that I've been trying to push her to better herself.

If she is showing no sign of unhappiness....then what are you worried about? Its almost like you're concocting this ""gro0mer"" narrative where this is none. Why?

If she was complaining or wasnt on board then I'd understand but....she has shown no sign of unhappiness.

"TLDR; I have an issue with my brother that I am refusing to budge on. The conflict from this and how I am handling this is making everyone unhappy- including myself but I don't know any other way to handle it without it coming at great personal expense. 

I am the youngest of three (25F) and my brother (36M) and my sister (29F) have all had fraught relationships with each other my entire life. I would describe my brother as eternally unhappy about not being an only child, a prodigal son, and very alternative in his lifestyle. My sister is hyper-sensitive  and reactive, and the most successful sibling. I would describe myself as a failure to start, also hyper sensitive, glass child. We are all very emotional people who are bad at conflict resolution and not very close to each other. In my family we are all supposed to just take the actions of others towards us but not do hold it against anyone. It's not healthy and I am unhappy with living that way. Sometimes it feels like I am the only who says ""I don't like how you're treating me or acting towards me. Please stop or apologize."" and I will be held responsible for the emotional meltdown of the person afterwards. I am often told to forgive but the other party is never told to apologize. 

&#x200B;

The current conflict: For the last five or so years, I don't really think I have had a positive interaction with my brother. It started when I came home from my freshman year of college. He had decided to buy a car off of someone, forge the signatures on the title (my name included) and turn it into the title office, despite my protesting. I was very angry about this, and he didn't resolve it until he scrapped the car a few years later with no apology or acknowledgement of wrongdoing. I had asked for intercession about this from my parents during the process, but they refused to step in and when I demanded him to remove me from the title, I was told I was being ungrateful, and I should be thankful that he wanted to put a car in my name. This is what started off what I think is a domino effect that made me an easy target for selfish actions. There have been other incidents, like sabotaging my education, poisoning my dog (he's okay now but we having to put him down was a very real topic of conversation) and then arguing with me about my being angry about it (""he's just a dog, you're being dramatic, debate flat earth with me or you're just as bad as them""), calling me a homophobic slur, became aggressive with my previous girlfriend, stealing thousands of dollars in art supplies from me I had bought myself, generally being unreliable, triggering dangerous mental health episodes of mine for convenience, and stealing my car. Each time I had tried to deal with it myself and was met from a lot of pushback from family to the point where now I don't talk to him or associate with him. I eventually moved out but the rent prices being what they are now (20% higher than last year) I have moved back in with my parents. 

&#x200B;

In the last seven-ish months or so, the conflict has escalated into a more complicated form. I am still no longer talking to him or giving him access to my life but his girlfriend has had a baby, my nephew. I don't want to give the wrong impression to his girlfriend who I really like so I am nice to her, I am friendly at a distance to my nephew, and I still don't talk to and ignore my brother when he comes over to my parents house. I haven't even gone to visit them at their house even though I know where it is and has been less than a 20 minute drive from my previous apartment because it is too painful to see my stolen things being mistreated. I have even brought my new girlfriend over during holidays or family gatherings and did not introduce them to one another and to be fair, he hasn't approached her at all to introduce himself either. I have been purposefully absent from major events revolving around him. I think my family really thought that I was going to give up at one point because when my sister and I would have major fights we would eventually come into an uneasy truce until the next conflict arose. However, I have not and I have been hearing it from everybody that what I am doing is unfair and hurtful. I received a text from him not around the time my nephew was born (I think it was beforehand) basically saying that he loved me and nothing was going to change that. I never responded and I have continued to ignore him. My sister has gotten after me and has said I am punishing everyone and need to let it go, my mom has said I need to forgive him and that I am hurting him and he is confused and my dad has refused to comment on it or be involved. I am done asking my parents to intercede on my behalf since they never have but the way I am handling things is apparently upsetting them and not the right way. I have asked for apologies from him, and I have asked for the things he has stolen back but I am met with a lot of resistance and anger on his side. 

&#x200B;

I am not really sure how I am supposed to proceed. I am of the understanding that asking my parents to mediate between us is inappropriate, it doesn't look like my brother will take steps to mend our relationship and I am unable to continue a relationship with him other than being in the same room as him without speaking to him.  It to me feels a matter of dignity and pride on both sides that keeps us from reconciling and if I am being honest, I don't even know what I would do if I received an apology. I think from my parents' perspective I am being dramatic, but I am really hurt. I don't know what to do. I am also not sure what my parents' role in this conflict would look like since I have moved back in. Clearly, they don't want to be involved but since I am living in their house now and my brother and his family come to visit weekly it feels unavoidable that tensions are going to rearise, and they are going to insert themselves (more than likely on his side). I already have plans to try to leave if they come over. 

&#x200B;

Any advice being given would be greatly appreciated since how I am handling things is clearly not the best, but my other option presented to me (let it go and go back apologize for trying to hold him accountable) is unacceptable to my personal dignity.

"Your brother doesn't respect you or your boundaries. He believes his ideas about you are more important than you. If the boundaries are important, it's pretty impossible to have a relationship with someone like this. Grey rocking and avoiding encounters with him, like you've been doing, is the way to go - you deserve kindness and respect.

Your brother has stolen from you, used hate speech against you and your partner, and committed identity fraud using your name. You have nothing to apologize for. He's lucky you didn't press charges. He may love you in his own way, but most folks would consider his behavior towards you to be disrespectful, unkind and abusive.

Families are systems. When one person changes their role, everyone else gets uncomfortable - they want everything to go back to the way it was. This is often unconscious. Just maintain your dignity and distance. You don't have to make a big deal about it - just treat yourself with the respect you deserve."

"For some background, me and my boyfriend have only been dating for 3 months and I truly want this to work. We met about 7 years ago online and were friends since we hit it off. Things got a little rocky because we both had our own life to deal with but we still stayed in contact and stayed as friends. Well, a few months back he decided to come meet me for the first time and we hit it off really well. It didn't take long before we got together. 

This is where we are at now. For the first two months, he would come over every weekend or every other weekend and he would normally spend 3 to 4 days with me and things were very well. Well, his car broke down and we haven't been able to see eachother for a month and it's becoming a real issue for us both because now we just dont know how to communicate or stop arguing.

The beginning of this month I know he's been struggling because he has to work 10 hour shifts and then come home to a girlfriend who complains 24/7 that I miss him and he expressed that to me. I took responsibility for that and I wanted to make it so I didn't put stress on him. I completely stopped bringing it up to him.

Well, I decided to stop expressing myself so much and give him a break and some space because he doesn't really know how to express his feelings very well so I try to help him the best I can, at a slow pace so he can open up when he needs. 

The problem lies when I try to open up now. He knew I wasn't mentally okay getting into this relationship and sometimes I have really bad days when I really need comfort, but it always turns into an argument now. I don't force myself onto him or ask for him to take the pain away, I just ask for a listening ear, but he always gets defensive and tells me that I'm stressing him out with what I'm saying or that my making him feel like a useless boyfriend. All I wanted to do was express my feelings like he asked me to do in the beginning of the relationship. It just always turns out to be an argument.

I know he's going through a lot and maybe I'm causing a lot of issues that I'm not really seeing but I just want to understand what I'm doing wrong so I can fix it. I know I'm not mentally okay and I overthink a lot, but he seems to be struggling a lot after we had to be long distance for a short while longer. Is this normal? Am I blind and not seeing a problem that's in my face? I'm actively trying to make up for being upset in the beginning of this month because I know he was stressed. I'm just not sure what I'm doing wrong.

Some additional information to know, I don't have a car or a job because of my father's wishes. I'm still in high school and my dad wants me to focus on my grades more than anything, If I could help him with money or getting a car, I would do it in a heartbeat. Another thing, I'm actively getting help with my mental issues, I've been in therapy for a while, but I'm switching my therapist because she made me very uncomfortable. 

TLDR: My boyfriend and I have been having a rocky relationship after we had to switch to a long distance relationship when his car broke down and now all we are doing is arguing.

"No, of course it's not normal to constantly argue with someone.

"It takes two people to communicate through their issues. It's not just on you to figure out and fix what you might be doing wrong according to your boyfriend. I can only speculate what he would say, that's why you need to be able to communicate with each other about the constant arguing, get each others perspective, and brainstorm on how you can work together to fix it.

If you are unable to do that, then this relationship is effectively over. You should be able to express yourself to your boyfriend, whether you are happy or struggling. But it's also valid if he doesn't have the bandwidth to deal with any additional stress, if he's already at his limit with what's going on in his life. In this case, it simply sounds like he's not in a place to be a good partner to anyone, not specifically just you. In either of these cases, you should break up.

Personally I think you having a rocky relationship at 3 months in tells me you two simply don't work in a relationship. The car breaking down only sped up these issues coming out, not the cause of them."	Mcnuggetsx3	reply	na	na	na	0.9979594945907593	weak	no	no	na	relationships

"I also posted this on r/ rant but I’m going to delete it. 

I’m not looking for advice so save it. Just need to rant. 

I’m so angry and feel so disrespected. This is the gist of it. The guy I’ve been seeing was in a sexual relationship prior to us being sneaky linkings. We started hanging out and eventually got more serious. I asked him if we were exclusive and he said we were. Fast forward a few months later there was a girl who asked us for a threesome. I declined, just wasn’t into her plus he told me that they had a history which made me uncomfortable. She in general just made me uncomfortable. I asked him again if we were exclusive and what that meant to him. He said we were and it means any sex without me was cheating. About a month ago one of my friends said she caught him going into his place with a girl. I was beside myself and confronted him. It was a misunderstanding. The girl herself told me a week later they were still fucking. I’ll talk about her crazy ass in another post about how she traumatized me. 

He hurt me so much and as time goes on I feel worse about it. I feel less confident and worthless because of this. I’m starting to feel depressed again. I still love him but I can’t see him the same because he lied to me. Lied to my face for no real reason. We didn’t have to be exclusive if he wasn’t ready to. I wasn’t pushing for a relationship. I cut off guys because I thought he wanted this and I was falling for him. I let him make the rules in this relationship so I don’t understand why this even happened. If he wanted open I wouldn’t be against it. The crazy thing is are relationship was good. My only complaints being that we’d often get to busy for each other and didn’t go out solo as much as we hoped and that his communication skills were not the best. Literally this has been the best relationship I’ve ever been in and now I’m just crushed. I cut off guys I was talking to for him. And I’m angry about it. I feel stupid for trusting him. I want to give us another chance but I don’t know if I can. Honestly, I have an ego and I was good to him too good. He doesn’t deserve me and I know I can do better which makes it hurt to stay. The worst part is we have the same friends. We were friends when we started hooking up. So it’s not an easy break up. It’s not like I can split and never talk to him again.

"I found out my boyfriend of almost 1 year cheated on me last year. It's a different situation I guess. He did it when we started being exclusive together, but without any label. He had a sexual instance with his bestfriend the night before our first date. It sucks and I know he's a different person today but it deeply pains me to fathom this information. I've confronted him about it as there is proof and he confessed to it, admitting he was wrong and there was also more. This certain bestfriend was kept all throughout the months we were dating, they had maintained a connection but as friends, which honestly, upsets me now that I'm aware about it. Other than that, there's been leaked convos of him having some sexual implications, jokes, etc. To the guy which was recent. It feels so unfair and I'm getting eaten up by sadness.

I know I cant forgive him or trust him easily again. He's blocked the guy and said he's willing to do anything for me. But I don't know exactly what I want. In my mind, he's a sweet, loving, and kind man who became the greatest thing in my life who who something so cruel, to me, to us. We shared a lot of vulnerabilities that I struggle to even share to friends. In short, of course I love him and he sees and understands me like no one else but I don't think I can exactly live with knowing this information and it drives me crazy. I also have a fear that we won't ever be truly happy like before. Can anyone please help me, advice or suggestions?

"I (24M) recently broke up with my girlfriend (26F) and I’m devastated. I, and my family, wholeheartedly thought that I would marry her. We were excited to talk about our timeline for getting engaged, and even got her ring sized. Now we’ve separated. 

Our breakup wasn’t messy at all, we cried together, we both wished it was different and admitted we still loved each other. Neither of us wanted this. We had a very strong relationship and I was extremely proud of the way we treated each other and communicated. We really practiced what we preached. We had normal bumps but nothing major and started to have serious conversations about what we wanted for ourselves in the future. As cliche as it sounds I was the happiest I’ve ever been when I was with her. My friends took notice of that and they all had such great feedback about her. I’ve never been able to be me around another person like I could with her. I took the “marry your best friend” advice so seriously and because of that I miss her deeper than a sexual standpoint or anything else. I miss my best friend and the best companion I’ve ever had. 

Unfortunately, she has an unhealthy relationship with her parents, although she can’t see it, and they are the reason we broke up. They control her through financial incentives despite her having an amazing career and not needing them. Often times I don’t think they took what she wanted into account enough and they made decisions based on what they wanted for her. Why she lets this go on is beyond me because otherwise she’s extremely independent. 

I hate this but I’ve suspected that they have a lot of jealousy towards my family over money. I think they look down on me because I didn’t want to take over my dads business even though this was a non issue to my family. My parents retired in their late 40s while her parents are ~20 years older and are still working and they’ve made weird comments about it. This was no issue to my girlfriend either but again her parents were the problem. Although I also have a great career it’s not enough for them. They’ve made every excuse as to why I’m not good enough for their daughter. She’s told them she disagrees and their assumptions are false. She claims to have put her foot down and done all that she can but they refused to want to change. For awhile they pretended like I didn’t exist. Then they uninvited me from family dinners when they were in town until they finally UNinvited me from a vacation with them. Clearly I am unwelcome in their company. 

This chipped away at our happiness for the last few months. We both knew this. We agreed that we didn’t have problems between us but this situation was the cause of our arguments. She apologized to me and agreed I don’t deserve this so I ended up breaking up with her because of her parents comments. I had to take a stand for myself but I’m frustrated because I felt like she could have done more. 

Nonetheless, we still text here and there after work but of course there is separation now. We caught up once for pizza and wine one night too. There’s been no break up sex nor will there be. We agreed there needs to be boundaries. We still want to fulfill some of our plans we had coming up together too. My problem is that I want nothing more than to spend time with her but when I look at her I only see the woman I love, the person who wanted to be wife, and my best friend. I can’t just erase all of my feelings. 

Do I go no contact to protect myself? Should I completely end things and start to try and get over her or enjoy what time we could still spend together? I don’t know if her parents would ever change and she just gives me the “if it’s meant to be we’ll get back together” line. I don’t want to cut her out of my life at all but I’m also so hurt because obviously it just doesn’t feel the same.

I agree.

Did you point-blank tell her specifically what you need in order to continue in the relationship?

You have to communicate your needs to her. She then gets to decide whether she is willing to meet those needs or not.

"I see a way there could be hope, but it doesn't sound like the 2 of you fully grasp the problem.  This isn't about her parents at all.  It's about her inability to stand up for you and demand they treat you with respect.  If she's the one telling you all this crap they're saying, she shouldn't be listening in the first place.   

She's a fully grown woman of 26 and she's way overdue to teach them how to treat her as an adult..  By extension, this includes her partner.  

You were pretty vague on the specifics, so it's hard to say more, but I do think it might be worth it to explain to her exactly where she's falling short.  She can be close to her parents without allowing them to sabotage her relationship.

Also, you used the term ""uninvite"" several times.  Are you saying you were initially invited and then they rescinded it?  If so, that's horrible and she shouldn't be going either.

Hell at one point she even suggested that we just elope to skip the drama and get on with it. If she established that separation then yes I would.

"This hasn't been the best of weeks. My now ex left me last week and i've been very very very confused. Im 39, she's 36, we had been dating for 8 years and all of the sudden, it's over. 

I understood her to be honest. She has MS and though i thought i was always supportive i guess it wasn't enough. I understand that. I just don't understand ""the other guy"" excuse... well myb i do, that's probably the part that makes me mad though. 

I haven't call her or anything since then. She wants to end things, im gonna respect it. She wanted to remain friends but i told her i couldn't right now, sorry,  i also have to think about myself. It wasn't blackmail like ""if you leave you will loose me forever"" or anything like that. She kinda new before hand that my reaction would be to disappear. 

And now that's my main problem. Being alone. I havent gone to any dating app or anything like that, i think it's still to soon. But i would be lying if i said i didn't think about it. I do. And that's freaking scary. Im still the same guy i was 8 years ago, a bit mature sure but still the same guy, i still give a lot importance to a women music taste for example and from what i've seen here on reddit, dating apps are the shallowst most superfecial thing on earth ever... so, your first interaction, its just to say ""hey i like you""... freaking redundant if you asked me. Do ppl there mention hobbies and interest? Look even if talking about one night stands, i think i still have that requirement. 

Its a stupid thing i have on my mind, i know. I should be thinking on being alone and love myself and all that crap. And yeah you right, but that goes even when you dating, and i don't think i lost that much self respect. I know i did nothing wrong, i know i was a good boyfriend, not perfect mind you, i know that too, but, i know what i did and i don't feel ashamed for anything.

I don't know if im asking for a advice, texting has been helping me to sort out my mind, but feel free to jump in.  Sure i have friends who listen and try to make me feel better, my family has also been awesome trying to make me happy, but sorting out my mind has to be alone with me in the real world. 

So that's it. Wanted to let this all out. Do i feel better now? I dunno. Maybe a bit. Still quoting the band the Weezer ""the world has turned, and left me here""...

"Terribly sorry to hear about your breakup.

Whether to jump back into dating is kind of tricky. On one hand, I'm not exactly confident that, if you were to start dating someone looking for a relationship, that you could honestly say ""I've processed all my feelings about my previous 8-year-long relationship that ended a week ago"".

But on the other hand... the desire for intimacy (emotional, personal, and sexual) is incredibly common and normal to feel after a breakup. I certainly can't fault you for wanting those things."	MrWednsday	reply	na	na	na	0.9890785813331604	strong	no	no	na	relationships

"Hi all, thank you for taking the time to read this. 

I'm 24(F) and the person I'm asking about (we'll call her C) is also 24F. 

C and I have been friends since high school (since about 2015 exactly). After we graduated, we became closer at our local community college and even lived together in an apartment during 2020. We probably would've been there longer if the pandemic hadn't kinda ruined my mental health and required me to move back home. During the time we lived together, we became extremely close friends. Even after we stopped living together, we still talked all the time and hung out when we could. 

Suddenly, maybe around the beginning of 2022, it became harder for me to respond to texts. It's hard to explain, but I would read the notification and for whatever reason, put off replying until later, and then it snowballed until I never replied to anything. And this hasn't been just happening with C, I've been doing this to EVERYONE. I've lost so many good friends in the past year simply because replying has gotten really hard for me. 

I think the last time I responded to one of C's messages was in January. I didn't even text her on her birthday even though I was thinking about it all day and feeling guilty; I just didn't know what to say. And that was in April.

I really miss her an and the insane thing is that I've been missing her this whole time. I just feel like I'm in a loop of shame and anxiety and I don't know what to say to her. But I miss her and I hope she misses me too and I just want her back in my life. I want to apologize and for her to know that she isn't the problem, I am.

If you were in C's shoes and a friend who randomly stopped replying to any of your messages started messaging you again, how would you react?

"we (33F, 42M) broke up a few months ago after three years together. we're best friends and had a close connection for years before dating. that has persisted even after breaking up. we're like months to flames for each other. we can't really stay apart. 

that means there's been some sexual encounters between us, post-breakup. he feels comfortable initiating with me, and i'm comfortable responding. we have that natural ease there. 

after our breakup, it feels worse. so what that looks like now is having our night together and then radio silence from him the morning/day after. it's disconnected, and it feels extra cold to me. i know we're not dating, but i still expect him to be tender with me. it's just a reflex. i also have to stifle my urge to be soft with him, in turn, because i don't want to be the sappy needy one. beyond the sex, we're still conversational and in-touch, we genuinely enjoy each other's company and sharing our lives with each other.

needless to say, it's really affecting my headspace.

as much as i love this man, as much as i crave him, i can't be in this limbo where we're both yearning for each other, yet the key issues aren't/won't be worked on. we tried to work on this problems, but without much consistent success. hence breaking up.

i don't know how to put a boundary between us where we aren't sleeping with each other, where this doesn't happen anymore. we didn't talk for two months or so after the break up. while that was so difficult, it was still a relief. of course, we've relapsed into this now, and i don't know how to initiate a clean break because i don't want to hurt him. i'm so in love with him. but i know this is the best thing to do. how do i put boundaries between us or do a clean break? if anyone has any advice on how to handle this, that would be appreciated.

"i am almost a year into my first relationship (I’m 19). It happened out of nowhere. The guy is perfect. I am very very attracted to him, i mean that. He’s a sweetheart, we go out almost every day, we have an extremely active sex life, i really believe we are just so meant for each other. He could never say a mean thing really, he’s just truly an Angel from above, and I love him, i show him off to everyone I know, I treat him good. He’s just incredible to me and I know I am so lucky. 


A few months ago I started a new job. Since the first day I fell hard for one of my coworkers. The guy is absolutely everything my mind could come up with if I were to imagine the most attractive guy on earth. His voice gives me chills when he talks to me, i get nervous when he stands over me, i can barely hold eye contact with him. I’ve literally spilled something on accident once he came into the room just knowing he was there.  I know our attraction is mutual. He found out I had a boyfriend, and doesn’t stop asking questions about him. He remembers all the little things about me and I do for him. I ran into him on the street today. I think about him pretty much all the time. I check my schedule every day to see if we are working the same shift. I spend extra time getting ready to look good for him. I am just lusting after him but I can barely handle it, i feel like I want him so bad that if he made a move on me I would give in. 

I never knew I could be intensely attracted to two men at the same time, to be honest. My attraction to this other man doesn’t cross my mind when I am with my boyfriend— I am only focused on my boyfriend. But whenever we are apart the thought of my coworker takes over. 

I do not want an open or polyamorous relationship. 

Is this normal? For me to crush on someone else while dating?

I really do not want to lose my boyfriend. But the thought of not just like sleeping with my coworker for my entire life i can barely handle

"Hi Reddit.

I (43F) can’t actually believe I’m making this post. The person I thought was my world (37M) my rock, has broken up with me.

Nothing seemed unusual at all, we have a very trusting relationship and I thought we were forever. He just came home from a work trip and is like a completely different person. I don’t recognise him at all. I know he hasn’t cheated so please don’t go there.

Anyway, we broke up. A punch in the gut, heart ripped out feeling has taken over and I feel like I’m losing my family and my life. It’s been a tough year, I nearly died a few months ago in an accident which was out of the blue, and to be followed by this is absolutely horrendous. There’s been no real catalyst for this, but his feelings somehow changed. Like he’s just out a shell around himself and that’s it. 

I’m close with his parents, they’ve been wonderful to me. We have pets, im pretty much only in this town because of him and im struggling to find the brain cells to start firing and start thinking about what I do next. 

I can’t rush to move out or anything, there’s somethings I will need to deal with first anyway. The rug has been pulled from under me and I’m trying to make sure that I don’t fall apart.

Please Reddit, tell me your stories where you had a breakup where the relationship was otherwise great and you went on to thrive. I don’t know where to start when considering a new life that’s being thrust in my direction. 

I need tips, advice, coping mechanisms, and the hope to know that I’ll bounce back from this stronger than ever. I’m overwhelmed by my loss.

TL;DR just had an unexpected break up and am in need of some hope that I’m not only going to be ok, but I’m going to be just great long term. Good break up advice and happy stories needed please."	jw1096	post	27.308701562866915	male	White	0.9986220598220825	na	na	na	3	relationships

"My (28/F) fiancé (32/m) and I have been together for almost 6 years. We get along really great, he’s my best friend, but he has anger issues. He doesn’t get physical with me or raise his voice at me and it’s something that I’ve known about since before we were together. We went to counseling about a year ago to address insecurities that I was having and communication on his end. Since then, I’ve addressed my own issues and my fiancé agrees that I’ve kept myself in check. 

We are still having trouble communicating however, which is important to me. It’s mostly while arguing. For example, today my fiancé called me after work. When I answered I noticed he sounded upset. He asked if I was home to swap cars to run an errand, I said yes, he said “ok bye”. I was like “wait, what’s wrong?” And he sighed and told me he doesn’t want me to ask questions and if he wants to tell me about something he would. This happens pretty often, sometimes I’ll ask a question or say “are you ok?” when it seems like something is wrong. 

We argued about why he can ask questions and it’s ok but I can’t, and he says that “he’s solving problems and I’m being sensitive”. We ended the conversation with me crying, as I’m very emotional, which upset him more. I asked how we can move on when he comes home the quickest. Usually when he’s upset, he stomps around and avoids me for hours. It can be a bit stressful during these times. He said “it’s already too late, you’ve already made me mad so I can’t come home and act like I’m not mad.”

Our counselor gave him lots of advice and ways to help but he doesn’t remember anything she said to him, only what she said to me about my issues. I’m going to ask to go back to counseling, but has anyone else been through this? The counselor explained that he has low empathy and I have high empathy and we are at opposite ends of the spectrum and have to learn to meet in the middle. What can I do during these times? I give him space but I don’t know what will trigger him. I just hate feeling punished for hours for asking what’s wrong when I notice he’s sounding frustrated. When he’s not mad everything is great! I just want to learn how to communicate better. It gets a lot deeper than this but it would be too long to get into. 

TLDR: my fiancé and I don’t communicate properly during arguments and things “snowball” into long arguments"	itoldonannfrankk	post	21.190526426141883	male	White	0.9976366758346558	na	na	na	5	relationships

"Just some other recent things we have argued about: 

I spilled milk in the garage and sprayed it out but he can still smell it

I asked for help moving some furniture inside before a storm, he got mad because he ran into the door and was upset that I have a rug in front of the door “when we don’t need it”

I told him I was overwhelmed with doing all of the  yard work. He hates being outside. He agreed to help but is mad the whole time because of the sun. This causes him to stomp around and avoid me 

Any time that I tell him he’s hurt my feelings. He always says “that wouldn’t have hurt my feelings” and he says that I need to think about if I’m actually hurt before “I make a big deal about it”, which is simply bringing up that I was hurt. This is probably the biggest one. I hate having to not talk about something that hurt me because it would cause an argument. We talked about blame-shifting with the counselor too and narcissistic behavior. He agreed to work on things and it went well for a month or so and slowly stopped. He makes sure to say “feelings” in a mocking way

All in all I just want to be able to say “this hurt me” and we talk about it without a 4 hour argument. I know this sounds terrible, and it’s just the negatives here.

I guess I need to see how well counseling goes this time around. We did see a counselor he was familiar with, he had visited her for years before we went together. I think I can be too forgiving. I had a lot of arguing in my childhood so when it starts getting tense I just try and move on quickly. She said that his “bad memory” could be his ADHD. I felt like she took up for him quite a bit because of the improvements he made from being a teenager. I just wish we could communicate in a healthy way.

"An old client of mine recommended me for a stellar job opportunity, to give you an insight to how amazing this offer is, it’s likely a position you would have to earn after 10+ years within your chosen field, the salary and company benefits speak for themselves. Before I even accepted to be interviewed for this job a long discussion was held with my boyfriend as this job would be in another country, he was nothing but supportive of me, encouraging me every step of the way even conducting mock interviews with me. 

As you can assume I was offered the contract, I was extremely excited to tell my boyfriend as we had been living off random fantasies for the past few weeks, thinking of memories we would make in another country, thinking back on the old memories we had made when we were still in our twenties. Only when I told my boyfriend he was as dead silent for what felt like forever, the only thing he said was ‘long distance is not an option’. I pleaded with him to reconsider, to relocate with me, we’re both familiar with the country this job is in, along with the language and we’ve even met a few people over the years who live there, we could easily reconnect and find our barrings but he was against it at every turn only saying ‘no’ to every suggestion I made. In the end he left in a huff and said he needed space, he has since ignored any messages or calls from me and has even had his best friend come to the house to pick up a few of his clothes for the rest of the week. 

I’m a little lost as how to talk to him again without it ending in the silent treatment. I understand asking him to relocate is a big deal but I assumed he was open to that discussion because he was the one to encourage me to pursue this job whilst I had no real faith in it. As for the distance it would only be 2 hours by flight, we’ve had a longer distance between us when we were still in university. His father even has connections in said country, opportunities are even available in the company that wants to take me on for him, so he wouldn’t be jobless. 

I just can’t understand why he won’t even talk to me about this? It’s completely out of character for him to be this distant and cold. Should I convince him to move with me or is there no hope left in our relationship?

TLDR: I was offered a new job and my boyfriend rejected the idea of us doing long distance or moving with me."	ThrowRa55192529929	post	23.347489718538718	female	White	0.9986135959625244	na	na	na	3	relationships

"My Boyfriend [22m] keeps telling “jokes” to me [23f] that are not funny

To preface this, I am autistic. I don’t have an understanding of joking at my expense. I can’t tell if someone is being serious with what they say or not. It’s really hard for me to understand jokes. I was bullied for years at school as well. 

Yesterday mom had a major heart attack. I asked him if he would give me a ride to the hospital to visit her. I do not drive because of the medication I am on (it was advised against by my doctor) He threw his head back into the headrest of the car groaned and said “I guess I can”.  When I became upset at his attitude about driving me he claims that it is just a joke and I need to lighten up. 

Today we were pricing out our bathroom reno. We were picking out bathtubs and surrounds. When I asked for a price on one to the salesman, my boyfriend said “Nope” abruptly and laughed at my expression. He then cut me off and started talking about what he wanted. 

When I asked why he had brought me in the first place if he wasn’t allowing me to speak he told me it was just a joke and it’s “not that serious”. I feel like I’m being bullied all over again. The same groan happens when I ask for help around the house, when I ask him to spend time with me, etc. 

Is this just me overreacting and overthinking things? Am I being offended over nothing? I have told him many times that I don’t understand his “jokes” and that they make me avoid talking around him or asking for help. He doesn’t listen. I don’t know how to fix this. I’ve given up trying to ask for help now.

"My (16F) dad (53M) is obsessed with cleaning. Every morning he wakes up at exactly 5:30 AM and starts cleaning the hallway, even though he already cleaned it the day before. When I wake up and go to say good morning to him, his first words to me are asking if I cleaned my room. It feels like he doesn't care about me, just about how clean my room is. When I sprained my ankle because I tripped on something in my bedroom and went to him for help he just said that it's my own fault for not keeping the room clean and that it's a good lesson for me. This wouldn't be such a big deal if he was being reasonable, but he doesn't want everything to be neat, he wants perfection.

He fights a lot with my mom (48F) over this, to the point where I wake up every morning to the sound of them yelling over cleaning. My dad works 2 days, then has a 2 day break. Every time he comes home from those 2 working days, he starts yelling at my mom for not cleaning the entire house and calls her lazy.  That's the first thing he says when he comes in the door, not a hello or anything, just starts yelling about the house not being clean (even though it is, just not perfect).

I admit that my room is sometimes messy, but most of the times it's what I would consider clean. I may have 2 shirts on my bed from not having time to put them back in the closet so I would not be late for school, but that can easily be solved. However my dad starts making a big deal over it, swearing, yelling and refusing to talk to me. When I come home from school and he's home I want to talk to him about my day, but he just tells me to go clean my room and completely ignores me. This makes me not want to talk to him at all anymore. Every time I want to start a conversation with him, he first asks if my room is clean. If I say yes, he goes to check and says that it's not clean enough and wants me to mop the floor. If I say no, he completely ignores me until he decides it's perfect enough.

This morning I slept on the couch because it was too hot in my bedroom and he went in to check how clean it was. I cleaned it just a day before so I was convinced that there will be no yelling today. When I went to say good morning he started yelling at me about my room not being clean and I told him that it is clean, however he said that it is not because I should've washed the floor (that I did 2 days prior) and that he has nothing to say to me.

I don't know what to do, this is very frustrating and it makes me not want to talk to him anymore. Everyone in the family dislikes him for this, my mom complains to me all day about him and my brother (23M) refuses to talk to him. He's my dad and I still love him and want things to work but this makes him unbearable. I also want to say that therapy is not an option since my parents are not open to it. I just want us all to get along.

TL;DR- My dad's cleaning obsession is ruining our family. He's a great dad overall but we fight everyday about cleaning. I love him and I want us to have a great relationship but I don't know what to do."	_RiceAddict_	post	12.069504975013473	female	White	0.9994801878929138	na	na	na	67	relationships

At the very least, they may help you manage your own distress invoked by this difficult situation. Start with DBT; Dialectical Behaviour Therapy. It's a really useful framework of learning to recognise resilience as a form of self-care. 

OCD is propelled by paranoia and fear. Your dad is repeating a toxic set of behaviours because they're what work to ease his worst fears - in DBT, he would be encouraged to confront these worries and ""radically"" accept that yes, it's possible for bad things to happen, and we can overcome them as we have done before.

It's not your job to be your mother's therapist. She shouldn't be complaining about him *to you*. Especially since she doesn't want to do anything about his behavior.

If i were you, i'd distance myself from both of them, and plan to move out as soon as possible.

Grey rock the sht out of your father (one word responses, don't engage, don't ask him questions, etc.) Don't try to solve this by cleaning even more, you already know it's not going to work - he will just raise his impossible standards even higher. Do what you can to avoid talking to him. Only talk to your mom about other things, don't let her dump her frustration with him on you. 

When you're an adult and don't live with them anymore, then it will be easier to have some sort of relationship with proper boundaries. It's not all lost. But for now you need to protect yourself. I'm sorry this is happening to you."	_RiceAddict_	reply	na	na	na	0.9994801878929138	no	strong	no	na	relationships
You are just awful your pops works so hard and you just make it harder for him. You know that the more you clean the easier it is? And anywork you don't do builds up and becomes more difficult to clean. You are literally going to destroy your family because of how inconceivably lazy you are.  I used to be just like you till i started working with my dad who only comes home to clean. Cleaning is not actually hard im a custodian i have to clean multiple rooms a day. It just irks me that this man probably has no one on his team but his wife and kid and all the kid is doing is going on reddit to try convince themselves its their dads fault. No this is your fault and if your family splits its 1000000% you're fault in this scenario. Im sorry whenever my dad asks me to clean I jump up. He never had to hit me i just realized that if this man dies than our lives are fucked so either make the situation uninhabitable or actually help because what you're doing is actually going to destroy your family. But dont feel too bad if you are this its probably your parents fault for raising you so horribly. No respect for your parents no respect for you.

"Hello everyone. I feel I am in a very sensitive situation at the moment, and I am a very implied person to this subreddit due to the amount of perspectives I can read about for my end goal in life of having a sweet family that I can treat well.  
I'm 23 years old. I have a good job and I live in the UK semi-permanently. I met Angela (22F) less than a year ago on an online game that we both play pretty much on a hardcore basis for years. In this game, there's a love story that heavily impacted our lives before we met and thanks to a community of fans of said story I was able to start meeting her.  
Angela lives in USA but is not a citizen, she is very talented and has a successful career and job on her shoulders despite her age. There's 1/3 of a day timezone difference, but we quickly grow fond of each other as we connected and impressed each other quickly. I showed a lot of interest and despite the timezone I pushed myself because I felt really comfortable together. Soon after I asked her out and we started spending pretty much 24 hours per day together, since both of us work from home.  
A month later I decided to reassure her that there is future between us and that I am fully commited by visiting her by plane on a 10+ hour flight to hers. I stayed there for 15 days and it was the most awesome vacation I've ever had on my life... To the point where we both were fully ready for a long term commitment and we got engaged, buying a very expensive ring splitting the cost 50/50.  
Since then, everything has been great. She has given me love and attention like I've never experienced. From my past experiences, I've always felt like the relationship was never meant to be, and she just shines brighter than the sun from the things I can appreciate when I'm with her. I literally get genuinely happy from being able to spend most of my day doing the thing I like the most, having quality time with her combining our hobbies. I quickly got my head thinking for how perfect it would be building a project of a family with her. She enjoys this idea so much that every day I receive a tiktok of a cute family having a desiring life for us to imagine and be on that situation eventually.  
We had planned that it would take us approximately 1.5 years to start a life together, as she is not willing to abandon the opportunities that USA provides because it's her main ambition in life. She thinks that the affordability and opportunities in this country are the most ideal to build a family together, despite the wait. We have contemplated a few options of us moving elsewhere in Europe (which we could do right away) but I don't really have any objection with eventually living in USA, if it wasn't because of the wait time for visa processing. I am not too happy because I would be away from my family, but I am very detached of them regardless, I live on my own on another country already and we mainly do video calls every 3-4 weeks.  
Since it's a LDR (Long Distance Relationship), there are many aspects that may seem challenging, but overall we always have had a fire inside to go through everything together as a team. One of the main fears is that, since we belong to that game community, she is terrified from the idea that I get attracted to someone else from that community, and viceversa.  
I have a strong opinion to this subject, because in my past relationship (that I almost settled myself for a bigger commitment than just being partners) my ex had been having an emotional affair with her ex and I was gaslit to feel paranoid if there was anything wrong with her until I eventually checked her messages and found all the evidence. The moment that I started meeting Angela, I completely shut down from ANY girl that would be talking and playing with me. Meeting her was literally magical, I've had the impression since then more and more that she IS the most perfect person I would ever love. We agreed on this soon before we started dating, and later on when we got engaged the first thing I did was to remove absolutely any girl from the game community that ever friended me, so there would be nothing but me having eyes for her.  
She did too, but in her situation there were obviously way more people that would attempt getting close to her and giving her attention. However, she always reassured me about it and made me feel special, going the extra mile by only us playing together, not adding random people from the internet or seeking for attention online. Not a single time in these months I could have any gut feeling that she is hiding from me, because when I am busy working or sleeping she would be sleeping or doing her hobby, which is streaming and gets recorded. The stream is fairly small, I am invited and welcome there and its focused on gaming.  
When I met her, among her friends she had one online male friend that we will call Brook (23?M). I was introduced to him and she described him as a friend that sticked through everything for 2 years, including all the dramas and relationship she's had since then. I saw his personality when she was streaming and I could only describe it as the obedient friend that praises her and goes out of his way to make her feel good. Since the beginning I saw that ""friendship"" to be completely unbalanced as the personality of Angela is very strong and Brook is too passive and complacent. The more we advanced in the relationship Angela and me, he was getting more distant and frustrated that despite his efforts Angela did not appreciate him.  
Very soon on the relationship I comfronted Angela about this. She was particularly fixed on one girl that I used to play with soon before I met her as she was afraid of her, and I completely reassured that this secondary girl has never been contacted ever since and that I've only known her for 4\~ months. As she was doing that, I felt more than justified to comfront Angela about Brook, since he is from said community that we've met from too.  
I communicated with her my fears regarding male friends that stick around females that would just use them to fulfil their egos. The male friends seem happy just from the interaction with this female they are idolizing because they get to spend time with her playing games. I just went through this specific scenario that I described to Angela a few months before I met her, and Angela reassured me very deeply that it wasn't this case with this person and that she trusted him completely.  
I half bought that, since in the past they seem to have been streaming together and shown him openly as her friend while she was already on a relationship with someone else, and I thought that if her ex was fine with that, I don't need to be too stubborn about it since she doesn't have many friends.  
A couple of months in the relationship, I was really starting to question Brooks' behaviour towards her. He is literally seeing a couple building up, but he was still going out of his way to give her attention. Spending hours chatting on her stream, throwing very slight comments while we all were playing at the same time complimenting and reassuring her, and trying to call her attention by mentioning how he was flirting with other girls that for some reason show interest in the same things Angela does.  
I fought against the current for MANY many days and nights having arguments that lasted hours because she somehow didn't see these things as weird of him. I remember ending the argument some days brushing it off because I was made to think everything between them remained within a healthy friendship. I made her promise me once and twice and five times in the same argument that there's nothing happening and let it be thinking that it must be my head overthinking due to previous experiences.  
Eventually I couldn't bear it. I saw that there is no way this can keep happening while we are both in a relationship and I told her that I've given up absolutely every person because what we had is special, that I didn't need any other friends to play with, because she is my one and only. Because of this agreement that she insisted on having the same as me, we would try to find acquaintances to play with on an environment that we both feel safe at. She finally ""agreed"" on the scenario with Brook getting out of hands, and the morning afterwards she started getting distant from him.  
This whole situation started to get very messy in my head. First, I didn't notice any change from Brook for two days. However, from one day to another, I start seeing a silent resentment towards me. Brook now would only chat in streams where she is alone, and absolutely never would join anywhere that I'm involved. I comfronted this with Angela and she mentions that there has been no contact at all with him about it, and we let that be from there. I obviously believe that there's something that triggered that reaction but at this point it doesn't matter  
Very few weeks after, I noticed her way more irascible than usual. Every time that we had an argument that gets heated, I was now put to blame for the amount of stress her life has now that ""her friends are gone"" (She only really cared about Brook in this scenario, there was still a female friend that was and is up to anything Angela wants to do). I feel terrible, because I might have destroyed a genuine friendship and I know that Angela gets stressed if it's only me.  
We made it through despite the difficulties because there was a visit to me for my birthday planned and we carried each other to love us as ""better times would come"" and our physical affection together does wonders for us. We celebrated my birthday and it honestly was the most amazing birthday that I could ever have asked for. She really made sure it was an outstanding day for the rest of my life.  
Back to our regular lives we happened to be revisiting her traumas, as on one conversation I heard her mumbling that she has been with a person 10 years older than her, and that shocked me completely. I thought we had explored our past relationships completely, and from this relationship I learnt that she's had several traumas with him, and just learning now that this person was 10 years older than her makes you wonder a lot and admittedly makes me insecure from not knowing the thought process for her to consider it. In my eyes, she's had people +-2 years difference in a relationship which I find completely normal.  
She got very offended from my reaction of me getting shocked from just finding out about this, and in the argument she ended up reassuring me that she is not hiding stuff from her past. She offered to show me if there was any past relationship she didn't warn me of, and while talking about a problem she had with one guy, she felt the need to mention that during a specific period two years ago she and Brook were talking ""closer"" while on a breakup from an ex (that they later reunited 3 months after).  
I immediately changed my face expression. I start connecting dots and I demand that she elaborates this. She vaguely does, saying they got ""closer"" again. I request her to show me the chat messages with Brook, to which she replies that she has deleted them already, and ""so does he"". I don't buy it because not a lot of people go through deleting their side of the chats unless they have something to hide, and in this situation I didn't see a reason for Brook to hide it, as I suspect him to always having had a crush on Angela.  
I then demand her to show me the chat with him, and she literally threatens me saying that if I dare to continue this way she will remove her ring from her finger and break up with me. I don't give in because I see that as a pitiful excuse to avoid showing me the chats and refusing to show me the chats at this point is enough of a reason for me to assume the worst. She understand that her efforts to threaten me are in vain and proceeds showing me how they've flirted and horny talked and acted as a couple for a few weeks right before she returned with her ex.  
I got super devastated from this. It literally meant that all the trust that I gave her the whole time that we were in the relationship was built upon a fake foundation. She has decided to actively lie to me about the past with Brook so she could maintain this friend around while she is in a relationship with me. I feel betrayed, I feel stupid for empathizing with her when she was missing her ""friend"", I feel disgusted from the moments I was gaslighted that they have always been a genuine friendship and nothing more, ever.  
When I saw everything, she immediately arranged us in a group chat to put an end to this situation for the sake of the relationship. Brook apparently understood it, so he got deleted everywhere and I stood there for a while seriously thinking about all this. She really showed me then that she was feeling awful for betraying me and ""fucking up the best relationship she's ever had"", that there could be solutions for this, making sure that she can regain my trust again eventually, even moving out with me if I wanted to...  
P.S. At the time that we started our relationship, they still exchanged ""I love you""s followed by a vague friendly chat for the first months until she started distancing with him.  
The truth is that I already went through a person showing me exactly these kind of promises. I know for certain that no one wants to be painted like the antagonist in the story, and this would be something that carries out more weight than what she expected back then. I told her all this, and despite the difficulties that it may mean, she says that she is really willing to give her all on this, as she has never cheated nor planned to. I believe this part, because outside of noticing that her mood would improve from having him around for attention, she didn't seem to be using him for anything else.  
Knowing this, I set my mind to actually continue fighting for the relationship and restart regaining my trust slowly, as we settled a pretty extensive mitigation plan to stay out of trouble with online people and only focus on the relationship.  
A day later, Brook went on a secondary account to DM Angela and told her to please leave one communication channel active between the two, to which Angela immediately told me about, and he got blocked from absolutely everywhere. I can only hope this promise is true.  
At the moment I am feeling hopeless. It's been less than a week and I am not able to believe her that she is feeling repent from all this. I have the impression that she has been selfishly keeping her image when she had to justify what's wrong with Brook to two different friends, making it look like she was just the one getting ""creeped on"". When I mentioned that this statement makes me feel she's brushing off the guilt from her side, she replied that those friends didn't need to know what happened exactly, to protect both of our images. I agree with that, but I find it concerning because she has never come clean about it to anyone and recently when we have arguments I see a pattern in which she mentions loud and clear that despite everything she did NOT cheat.  
I feel very weak from all these events... We just had an argument yesterday because I am constantly feeling like I am not enough and that she doesn't appreciate me nor respect me. Up until yesterday I was able to refute and be up to discuss together the things that we disagree with so we can understand each other, but yesterday it was different. I distanced from her for a few hours while I was working and I understood my mind that I am no longer feeling this magic in our relationship because of the betrayal... As soon as I had the chance, we went on a call and we talked through everything. I made her know that I need to let out my thoughts on this because it's eating me alive and I want to understand my emotions.  
She promised to help me on this difficult time and put extra effort when I am feeling weak until I am able to get back on track, so I ultimately would like to know how to see past this trauma and heal my trust with her. I can really see myself living a beautiful life with her company. Every life goal that I can set my mind to achieve would feel 1000x times better if celebrated with her, and I know that I can keep fighting if we deal with this situation with love and care, and she demonstrates that she can redeem herself from this. She is even flipping her sleep schedule so we can be 24 hours together waking up at the same time for these next two weeks... After that, I will visit her in USA and we really want to heal and stop being afraid.

"I 23[m] met my girlfriend 21[f] at the very beginning of 2020. Our relationship has been good between us for a while I’m in the navy and a couple months ago I got stationed in Hawaii for the next 3 years and she stayed back home with her family and where my family is from too. When we first met things where great but we had our ups and downs, and when I moved to Hawaii things were really good between us. We talked to each other about how we were going to make this work even though there was a 6 hour time difference and I have a very tough schedule where I have to flip my sleep schedule every 8 days to nights and vice versa. We made sure that we communicated how we felt and talked about how we could spend time together like FaceTime dates, watching movies together or playing video games with each other Over the past month and a half or so I’ve slowly watched as she stopped putting in effort to plan things out between us, and stopped communicating to the point where when we would talk on the phone it was like I was talking to a brick wall, she was very responsive but would rarely ever initiate any kind of a conversation, as I watch this happen I did try to talk to her and see if maybe she had something going on in her personal life that was affecting her and she just hadn’t told me, or that her needs weren’t being met, which she told that she was okay and that we were good, (as in the relationship). I eventually asked a few more times if there was anything going on that she wanted to talk about anything or if there was anything I could do, and she insisted that she was okay and that things were good between us, she then told me that I was trying to fix our relationship all the time instead of just being in the relationship, after she told me that I then keep trying to plan things out for us to do together I tried giving each other a little space to see if things would change between us and things kept moving in the same direction, I eventually told her after about a month that I wasn’t happy with the way things were between us because I felt like she wasn’t putting in any effort to the relationship anymore, and a couple days later she told me over text that we should take break for a couple of days, and at the beginning of our relationship I told her about how I felt about breaks and how they were just an excuse to cheat on your partner. After I read the text I decided to tell her that we should just end things between us instead of taking a break because I thought she was just using it as an excuse to take the easy way out of our relationship so then I proceeded to try and break up with her. She stated that she just needed time to figure out our schedules because she was working, and going to classes on top of that and that she didn’t want to break up. We didn’t really talk for the next couple of days but when we eventually did she explained that she wasn’t trying to cheat or break up but was just trying to take a few days to get things sorted on her end. I asked her if she had cheated or had slept with anyone in the past couple of days and she said “I can’t believe you would even thing I would do that”. I told her you asked to take a break and that’s what people do when they ask to take a break. She then responded by saying “I’m not like other people I wouldn’t do that to you”. I looked at her instagram and seen that she had started following 2 guys while we were on a break, so I brought it up to her and she said she worked with one of them and that he was much older than her, and she was following the other guy so her friend could stalk his profile, when I heard this I knew it had to be a lie bc it didn’t make any sense and all it did was raise red flags, so I told her that I didn’t trust her and that I wanted her to screenshot her socials to prove nothing was going on and her attitude completely changed and she got defensive about the whole situation. This is as up to date as this post can be I’ll update it if anything happens.

TLDR: I don’t trust my girlfriend anymore because she asked to take a break."	AhhBamBam22	post	28.04315003639854	male	White	0.9984655380249023	na	na	na	1	relationships

"I (37M) have been dating her (31F) for one year. We both work a lot and have professional jobs; she is a doctor and I am a lawyer. When we are sober, our relationship is usually pretty great. We have taken many trips together and plan to take many more. We've met each others families and have talked extensively about marriage/our future.

  
Since we began dating, I have noticed a constant pattern. She likes to drink and go out to bars/parties/social events (as do I). Whenever she drinks and goes out, she acts differently. She doesn't act respectful, appreciative, compassionate, loyal or loving to me. She, instead, acts like she doesn't care about me. She will flirt openly with guys in front of me (even when we are out with her friends or on a trip with her friends). She doesn't treat me like a boyfriend or companion. Any guy (or girl) that gives her attention, she returns the favor and loves the attention. She seems very cold, distant, and withdrawn to me---like she has a wicked look in her eye. I have told her that I can't stand this--it makes me feel so small, unappreciated, and NOT like a man...I need respect/loyalty/love when we are out socializing, not just when we are sober and sitting at home. I wonder if she is just truly unhappy with herself (which comes out when she drinks), if she just doesn't respect or value me, OR if it is simply an alcohol problem. For the record, I have discussed with her that this is a problem in our relationship probably 15-20 times. She is not the submissive type, so she resists ""control"" or me trying to change how she acts. What should I do? Can the problem be fixed?

"“Can the problem be fixed?”

Everything that will be suggested IE talking to her and expressing your feelings has already been tried and she’s made it pretty clear she doesn’t appreciate being told what she can’t do. 

So honestly? No. This is who she is.

"When you talk to her about it, try to stay away from phrases like ""-it makes me feel so small, unappreciated, and NOT like a man, disrespected"" I know that's how you feel. In the same situation I felt the same way (although the circumstances were different). When I used those phrases she would practically get triggered into saying that I am just being overly sensitive, insecure, jealous etc. But then I found out the advice ""tell them how their behavior makes you feel"" isn't what I thought it was. Feeling small, unappreciated, and NOT like a man, disrespected, those are all emotions (apparently). Her confrontational attitude went away once I figured out when I learned how my emotions actually made me feel and expressed it: ""When we are out with your friends, you tend to act like I am just an option to you, and not a commitment""... And once I said that, she stopped being defensive and things did change for the better. (In her case she didn't want her friends thinking that she was dependent on a relationship to be fulfilled)

"I mean this interesting, because her behavior absolutely sounds like a problem, but you also, maybe ... there are a few things in the way that you talk about this which make me wonder. 

I think a lot of people would raise an eyebrow if their partner said, ""I need loyalty at all times."" Like, how are we defining loyalty here? It's quite possible that the way you communicate your problems with her behavior comes across as really controlling. The fact that you say that she's not the ""submissive type"" makes it sound like you're inherently framing these conversations in your mind (and possibly with her) as about dominance and submission which is ... kind of icky. At best. 

Like, I wouldn't be terribly surprised if she felt like if she so much as talked to someone else at a party that she was being accused of disloyalty, disrespect, and failing to ""submit."" You're definitely pinging my ""the two people in this relationship would describe this conflict VERY differently"" radar (which isn't 100% accurate, but ... it's pretty good). 

That being said, at a certain point, someone is who they are. Someone who likes to get flirty when they're out being social and drinking probably needs to date someone who isn't put off by them being flirty. If that's who she is and she doesn't want to change, then your choices are to either accept that this is who she is or to choose to date someone else. She'll either find someone who doesn't mind, she'll eventually figure out she has to change, or she'll be single.

It looks like she doesn’t indeed respect you in her heart and when alcohol removes her inhibitions, it shows on the surface. I don’t think you can win her respect by asking her for respect. It’s hard to tell, without more background, why exactly she is disrespectful to you. It may be her personal trait - constant crave for attention, or she thinks she can do better than you, or maybe your past actions made her qualify you as not deserving her respect. One of such things is that you are still tolerating her public wiping her feet on your face. At any rate, this is hardly fixable.

"""I mean this interesting, because her behavior absolutely sounds like a problem, but you also, maybe ... there are a few things in the way that you talk about this which make me wonder.""

Absolutely my thoughts as well

Reading this, the girlfriend's behavior sounds terrible, and what I as a woman would describe as emotional abuse if a partner treated me that way.  Ignoring your partner in public, brushing off any affection they try to show you, and flirting shamelessly in front of them is actually a thing I've witnessed before and it definitely can be done intentionally to belittle a partner and not just because they have a ""flirty personality"". Of course, you cannot reason with a partner that treats you badly.  You simply have to leave them, and resolve to never treat a future partner the way they have treated you. 

But the way Op describes the problem makes HIM seem like the emotional abuser. Using words like loyalty, submissive, ""I don't feel like a man"", ""even in front of her friends"", ""wicked look in her eye"", blahblah 

Honestly, it might be the case of just two questionable people dating each other. Gf doesnt like Op all that much and is an asshole when drunk; op is jealous and controlling at worst or has a poor sense of how to communicate his feelings at best

I think op could try one more time to communicate his feelings, using more sensitive and less borderline misogynistic language, but there's a lot of potential for deeper issues on both their ends"	AdSame8299	reply	na	na	na	0.9993701577186584	weak	no	no	na	relationships

"Tldr; it’s a year since I’ve known him and we are mid argument and I’m exhausted from it.

So we have had a turbulent relationship . At first we were friends then in December we became boyfriend and girlfriend.

We keep arguing. Well what happens is he blocks me on Snapchat then doesn’t reply to my iMessages until he then explains what I did wrong and says it’s over. Then I’m like why didn’t you talk about this issue before blocking me. I just feel shit.

I want him to love me. I love him. But we just argue over nothing. Our latest is about me going to see barbie movie and apparently turning my location of when actually I was on WiFi and when I left my house I had no signal so I didn’t realise. He thought I’d turned my location off so he blocked me and has accused me of lying when I try to explain.

It’s just constant accusations of infidelity. Like how I went hiking with my cousin and he didn’t believe I was going hiking and thought I was seeing a guy because I said “I’m going walking” instead of “hiking”. Then when I explained hiking he was like “ohhh”.

He just doesn’t trust me and trust is a big thing for me. When is at this he says “me too” but he doesn’t even trust me. I’m just sick and tired of being accused blocked and on an emotional rollercoaster for things I didn’t even mean to do. Like I just make a mistake and don’t know what I’ve done and he blocks me. I just feel awful.

I love him so much so it would be hard leaving him but I’m accepting that it most likely won’t work out and now I’m worried for him thinking he won’t ever be in another relationship because of how high his impossible standards are. All I wanted was his love. I just wanted to be loved. That’s all I ever wanted from him.

I’ve also cancelled going to a festival with my friends because he wasn’t happy with me going and said he would break up if I went and I’m loosing him before that anyway.

I just feel so alone and unloveable right now. I’m sick of making mistakes and wish I thought more. I love him. He doesn’t love me. I can’t deal with that."	happycatfloofy	post	19.57736330580673	female	White	0.9994120597839355	na	na	na	3	relationships

"I needed a place to share and seek positive advice (preferably) for something I experienced. Before recounting the story, I acknowledge that I made mistakes by getting involved in something I shouldn't have, and I'm determined not to repeat these errors. Currently, I'm in a state of deep reflection, open to constructive criticism and guidance.  
  
I (21M) met a person (21F) a few months ago through HelloTalk. Initially, our connection was based on the desire to practice English, as she was American and fluent in Portuguese. Over time, we deepened our interaction to WhatsApp, and gradually discovered striking similarities in our personalities. It was almost surreal to find someone so similar to me. While her beauty was evident, the most remarkable aspect was our emotional connection.  
  
As the days passed, our conversations evolved, and we decided to watch a show together on Rave, an experience that marked the beginning of a long-distance relationship. At this point, the feelings between us seemed to have grown to the point where they could be labeled as love. This perspective was comforting, especially since we shared the same language, and she had plans to visit my country.  
  
However, over time, subtle changes in her attitude began to emerge. There was a noticeable nighttime distancing, quick and spaced-out interactions, and the absence of goodnight messages, a habit we had cultivated. Initially, I interpreted this behavior as mere busyness and fatigue. These gaps in responses were still acceptable, albeit frequent.  
  
Nevertheless, my insecurity heightened when I discovered the existence of an Instagram profile she had denied having. This triggered a search that revealed more details, including a different last name and more followers. Shortly after, I found her Facebook profile, where I was confronted with a painful truth: she had been married for two years.  
  
The initial shock led me to question her, and her response, though belated, justified that she had omitted the truth to avoid pushing me away. According to her, her relationship with her husband was in shambles, lacking communication and emotional connection. In a moment of weakness, I believed her words and decided to stay in the relationship, aware of her situation.  
  
As the months went by, more secrets emerged, and I insisted that she confront her marital issues. However, I realized that my position as ""number two"" was harming me emotionally. After multiple attempts to break the bond, I contacted her friend, seeking impartial advice.  
  
During this conversation, I was confronted with the truth about a kiss at a party. Contrary to what she had told me, she allowed the kiss and deliberately omitted this information. The feeling of betrayal was overwhelming, and my self-esteem took a blow. While determined to focus on her marriage after this conversation with her friend, she chose silence in response to my messages.  
  
Now, I find myself in a state of mixed emotions, a mixture of relief for the end of this relationship and sadness for the disillusionment. I acknowledge my responsibility for accepting this situation, but I was trapped in an illusion that I couldn't break free from. I wish to move forward in a healthy way, without carrying this emotional burden.  
  
If anyone has gone through something similar or has advice for moving forward positively, I gladly welcome your perspectives and suggestions. I appreciate the opportunity to share and learn from others, as I am committed to growing from this experience.

I also randomly started to get to know his younger sister who i’ve never met in person. One day out of the blue he also gave me his email and password so i can access an online subscription.

He keeps giving me mixed messages, and it’s really weird how one day he gives me a personal account password and another day he ignores my messages for weeks and then randomly contacts me again! 

I’ve had a crush on him for four years now and I want to stop being confused and i’m tired of having this crush hahaha. I know he’s single. But i’m terrified i’ve just been delulu this whole time, and also terrified for his response if i tell him i like him. 

Does he like me? Is he super shy? Do shy guys act like this? Should i just confront him and say I like him? How are you even supposed to tell a guy you like them? I have no experience!!

TL;DR - I have a crush on this guy who’s giving me mixed messages. Should I just confront him?"	_questionsyou	post	11.083253942570378	male	White	0.9971575736999512	na	na	na	1	relationships
I think you should tell him, we only have one life and it sounds like he feels the same way (I don’t really know but sounds like there’s a chance) Theres nothing to lose besides maybe feeling awkward if he doesn’t feel the same way?

"Hi  
  
I am a dude, working as a software engineer and making some good money and worked extremely hard for the money I earned, I never been in debt, work in restaurants, etc. and now I am a successfully software engineer in Chicago . Now, my sister all of a sudden is decided to get her second master in ""art and design"" from a very expensive university in New York. My sister is putting my mother under pressure to ask me for money and financial proof and paying little stuff here and there. The problem is, my sister is real jerk, over the past 6 years she NEVER called me to ask me how am I doing, the only times she called me was the times, she wanted something from me usually some money. I used to help her although a world class jerk but she is a part of family and I wanted to her because she is my family (although not optimal).  
  
The real problem right now is that she wants to get her second master ( she has a bachelor in Fine Arts -> paid by my parents and I paid for my bachelor and master all by myself without any help or something, she also has a master in some design stuff and now, she wants to attend some real expensive private art university in N.Y.).  
  
Under the pressure of my mother, at some point, I had to provide some financial form which would state that how much I got in my bank account and now, for the first of ever, they know how much I have in my bank account!!! ) but the problem is as I said, I am doing all these because of my mother. The sister is real B. She talks with my mother all day long and then my mother somehow convince to to provide these financial papers and financial help (so far, in the scale of about 800$).  
  
The main problem is, the sister doesn't talk to directly, doesn't say thank you. doesn't appreciate anything (not that I am looking for a thank you, no, but a simple thank you is better than NOTHING!), she doesn't call me, she just texting me, happened a lot of times that I call my mother and she came and interrupt and doesn't let me to talk to my mother, and a whole lot more stuff. The only reason I have to provide these financial things is the pressure from my mother. I really love my mother and I know she loves me but this whole thing is getting out of control, I am afraid the sister start asking for more and more and more ....  
  
we are coming a middle class family, my father is around but doesn't engage much in anything, tries to stay aside. My mother's financial situation is pretty good and well off but nothing luxury.  
  
  
  
Now, the question is what am I suppose to do in this situation ? because I am kinda desperate. Looks like I have been emotionally taken hostage. Anybody has experience in this type of situation? how should I politely refuse to help the sister (which clearly tries to take advantage of me financially and she is perfectly fine with keep studying art at the age of 30 for yet another 2 years), without destroying my relationship with my mother ? I know I cannot make everybody happy but I need a strategy to get myself out of this with minimum relationship damage with my mother.

&#x200B;

tl;dr : the sister is constantly asking for money through my mother, means she doesn't directly talked to me, she goes through my mother and then my mother asks me for some financial thing. Looks like I am been taking advantage of financially. Any solutions?

"Hey reddit, this is my first post on here as I'm just normally snooping around, but something had happened today and I'd like to get it off my chest. I say ""girlfriend"" in this scenario but I should have probably said ""ex-girlfriend"" lol.

For context me, the boyfriend (20m) doesn't mind my (20f) girlfriend going through my phone, looking at whatever she wants to etc, I have nothing to hide, the problem is mine and hers sense of humour is very different, and I suppose I can be quite childish at times when it comes to saying things.

She went onto my phone and went to messages with me and a friend, she didn't want me to look while she read through them (thought that was weird but no problem not like I had said anything horrible or bad about her), she skips back a few months into the daily messaging that me and my friend do, searches her name up in the Keywords section to see every single message I've sent with her name in it, and other things such as ""girlfriend"" ""anna"" ""gf"", you get the jist.

She searches up her name, and there was a message before we even got together, months and months ago which states the following.

Me: she's coming over to my house

Friend: you gonna fuck her?

Me: think so

To make it clear, I had no intentions of 'fucking her' or doing anything at that point, we had known each other for a short period of time and I was getting to know her a little bit more. Well, my girlfriend has seen this message and she freaks out, starts crying, saying how could I do something like this, saying ""you just looked at me like everybody else did"" ""this was your intentions from the start"". We've been together for nearly 5 months now. And to make it clear, I didn't try anything or ask anything until we were officially together, and with both of our full consent. I have a weird sense of humour, so I just said ""think so"", knowing I wasn't going to do anything, I didn't do anything, I literally had just said ""think so"" in a message to a friend of mine.

What do you guys think? I'm really stressed and I'm really panicking at the minute

tl;dr: girlfriend went on my phone, saw a stupid text i sent to a friend, broke up with me over it

"So I still live with my parents, actually grandparents after finishing high school two years ago, and have been focusing on my mental health. I pay for all my own expenses (phone, hobbies, transport, food, necessities..), and work part time mainly to pay expenses, travel and save up to hopefully move out soon. My parents think I should give them money every month ""for living here"". They're also awfully dismissive and dont care to listen to my concerns/ opinions. 

*The financial aspect*  
Firstly, my parents aren't rich but they have always afforded groceries, rent and paid the expenses I pay for myself now. My sister is moved out and I support my own interests, so they shouldn't need my support to get by. I send them 100$ every month, sometimes more which I honestly dont see a dime of. I dont see any additional resources at home or anything. I dont understand why I need to pay ""rent"" to live in my childhood home... They took me in when my biological mother couldn't have me, only to make me feel like I need to repay them for the bare minimum. In my opinion parents should try to HELP their children to leave the ""nest"", it makes it hard to save up when I have to pay them 100$ of my small paycheck every month.  


*Toxic behavior*  
Both my parents, but especially my mom, cant handle critique. They are extremely individualistic and take everything personally. You can only forget mentioning any concerns that are about their behavior. Whenever I tried to carefully bring up how theres food leftovers after she does the dishes, she will either ""ignore"" me or just get hostile. I have ASD and ADHD and notice small things such as cross contamination or bad air, and try my best not to be a bother to my family. But whenever I say ANYTHING about ANYTHING no one will listen to me. They will dismiss me, yell at me to shut up, or to fix it myself.  


Heres an example. So yesterday I showered before bed around 11pm. While I was in the shower my mom had to use the toilet. She commented on how late Im showering implying theres a problem about it. So I asked if theres a problem with it. In a salty tone she said ""no theres no problem."", but she was obviously mad about something. I told her if theres any problem with me showering late I would like to know about it. Then she suddenly just got mad and hostile out of nowhere and yelled ""I just dont like that you shower late, theres no reason"". I dont understand why she is so negative and hostile towards me, when I can NEVER EVER comment anything about her behavior. She is also really messy and has bad habits such as not using a plate to eat crumbly food, not cleaning or squeezing the sponge after use, leaving food leftovers everywhere after cooking, using dirty utensils to clean, I could go on and on. But god forbid I dare to comment on ANYTHING. She immediately gets defensive and starts telling me all my flaws.  

*Summary*
We dont eat together, barely converse and I feel awkward most of the time around them. I have so much anger towards them and I dont know how to even bring all of this up. I know the solution is for me to move out, but they're not making it so easy on me taking a third of my pay every month. How will I even tell them I dont agree with them about me having to pay them to live home? I have no idea how to communicate with them cause they never listen to me and act hostile whenever I try being honest. They dont care about my ASD or ADHD diagnosis or what it means, they didnt care to learn about it or to try and make it easier for me to live. Theres no structure at all, and I get really depressed to the point of having suicidal thoughts.  


I need advice on how to go forward with this situation and tell them I cant keep living like this. Im really scared they wont understand and I will make the situation worse. Thanks if you made it here.  

tl;dr:   
Parents dont understand how them demanding me to give them money is wrong, and are extremely egocentric and hostile whenever I critique them in any way. Its making it really hard for me to live a normal healthy life at home, and is taking a toll on my mental health. I cant keep living like this and need advice on how to deal with them."

"A friend and I hooked up when we were drunk. We've known each other for one year.

He gets flirty when he's drunk and stupidly I thought he liked me because he does it all the time. This time I played along and we had a good time.
The next day he clearly regretted it cause he asked if I'm feeling weird, I said yes and we decided to keep it between us and continue to be friends. He also confessed that something similar happened with another girl from our group a while back and that he wants to give up alcohol so he stops doing this.

I felt silly, but also realised there was never anything really there so we acted as normal going forward.

I now found out that they had a bit more than a hook up, with conversations about starting a relationship to which he said he can't have a relationship.

I also learnt that he's been acting jealous of her with another guy, who is my good friend.

I'm not gonna lie, now I'm hurt and jealous as I feel used and want to distance myself from him. But I also want him to not negate his feelings for her if there are any? I'm weird I know. 

Should I message him something? I want him to know I know there was/is more between them and I don't like him lying to me and how he used me.

If yes what?

Or should I just leave it so I don't seem like the annoying, jealous girl he rejected?

TL;dr : Should I message my friend who I hooked up with and thought he liked me, that I know he's had more than just a one night stand with our other friend, so he knows I'm hurt and will no longer be friends with him?"

"> The next day he clearly regretted it cause he asked if I'm feeling weird, I said yes

So, look, I don't know what *else* is going on here, but this seems like a huge leap on your part.

One thing worth remembering is that people get super self-conscious and self-protective after hookups. Like, he noticed you were acting a little off, and asked you if you felt weird, and you said yes. 

From that point forward, you can not expect him to act as if he's super into you, because you have communicated to him that you're NOT super into him. That's how literally everyone will interpret you saying you feel weird the next morning. He's almost certainly sitting there thinking that YOU'RE regretting it! Otherwise why would you feel weird about it? 

(Now, look, I had to double-check your ages, because I would hope most people would be better about navigating this stuff by the time they're your age. But you both sound pretty awful at it.)

>I now found out that they had a bit more than a hook up, with conversations about starting a relationship to which he said he can't have a relationship.

I mean, maybe he said he couldn't have a relationship with her because he was secretly crushing on you! 

Do I think that's super likely? No. But I use it as a counterexample: if we're just going to make up stuff to fill in the gaps to explain his behavior, we can come up with stuff that makes him sound super into you! This is why *we shouldn't just make up stuff to explain somebody else's behavior.*

Here's the thing: if you want a relationship with him, you have to say so. Because in his mind, you probably told him that you didn't. He may well feel rejected by you, and you're now interpreting his rejected-behavior as meaning he wasn't into you to begin with. 

Also, he didn't have to tell you every jot and tittle of what he did with your other friend before you two have even become a couple. It's unreasonable for you to expect the full story at this point."	ThrowRA-654	reply	na	na	na	0.9984241724014282	weak	no	no	na	relationships
"I see how I might have closed him off with my reply. Hours before he asked if I felt weird we were joking about being hangover and then he said how he would've worked from my building's back garden if he had his work laptop with him. I closed this off with ""I'm glad you didn't"" wanting to mean that would've been very uncomfortable and he replied ""don't worry me too"" and I went silent. But then he also thanked me when I agreed to keep it between ourselves.

Now I don't want to illude myself, I know he's been checking with people when is she around so that he's around. He was implying there was something between her and someone else like he was jealous of her. 

I agree, he had no obligation to tell me anything, I guess I'm just hurt.

I guess my question is then, how good of an idea is to talk with him about all this without being super annoying if we assume he just wanted to hook up the one time. I know he thinks highly of me usually."	ThrowRA-654	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9984241724014282	weak	strong	no	na	relationships

"Hey everyone. I didn't know where to post this, or if I'm asking for advice or venting. That is to say, any kind of response is welcome, both advice and general statements, I don't mind. 

So I'm (M 23) probably the black sheep of the family. Not exactly how you might expect though. I'm in good shape, have a decent job, a house, I recently got married, get along great with my wife(F 21).

I grew up to a family who were and are, extremely poor. Most people don't really believe or fully understand what it means when a person who grew up poor says that. It feels like such an understatement. To be clear, poor as in ""I'm shocked CPS didn't take me away"" poor, no food sometimes and parents struggling to keep minimum wage jobs or a car poor. Maybe what is commonly called redneck or ""white trash"". How I am not that way and support my wife at age 23 is a whole other story for a different time. I have a strong mountain man streak still of course 🤠

To make things more complicated I'm a black sheep because I'm probably the only person in the family who is not suffering a severe metal health diagnosis. My brother is schizophrenic, sister and mom severe bi polar, grand parents live in their car due to schizophrenia causing unlivable disillusions. We live in rural Appalachia. More things like drugs and lack of opportunity are at play with them too.

My family rely on me in a way that most people would feel inappropriate, but to me I just can't tell. Maybe the trauma bonding from years of growing up like that, maybe guilt. I give all of them rides to and from their jobs. I know this sound untenable because I don't even live in the same town as them but the guilt of knowing I can, and if I don't they'll have no money and nothing else as a result kills me. This means I wake up early, and go to bed late, I also have to squeeze in 8 hours of work in there too. 

The toilet broke at their house a few months back. I showed them a how-to video and the ordered them the part. I learned that months later it was still broken. I fixed it in 5 minutes after going there. Family holidays happen wherever I live. And I cook them. I recently saw the movie Hillbilly Eligy and cried buckets. I was thinking ""man, I lived this, I LIVE this now"". My wife had never seen me in such a state, the fact that she didn't see what I saw (how could she of course not her fault) made he feel so alone. It's hard when you can't lean on family for anything, and no one else understands. The pressure of providing for them, and providing for my wife at such a young age is a lot. 

People say ""cut them off"". Those words hurt me. Most people just can't relate to what it feels like. Imagining holding your mom or dads hand on a cliff side and someone says ""let go, it's hurting your arm"". It's feels so normal to me in some ways. Maybe you gathered this already but I never had a real childhood. I have been an adult so long as I have had needs you could say. 

Now that I'm married my wife may be the most patient person on this earth. I have no idea how she handles having a husband practically married to his family, she meant my mother the car I got for her to use when hers broke down. This was in the days when I thought my family might be able to get or maintain a car. Eventually it ran out of gas and I went and picked up the gasless car, full of trash and ciggeretes butts from the highway. but I know this is too much for my wife despite her support. She needs space, she needs to see me, she needs a husband. I just don't know how to handle it all.

I'm not the type to really post, it write about my problems. I'm a blue collar man who is used to just swallowing things. Carrying everything as best I can. I find it hard to communicate it to my wife. I can tell she wants me to, but I'm afraid she'll loose confidence in me.

My worry is your relationship with your family will negatively impact your marriage. And if you plan on having kids you need to figure our your parenting style.

"F19 M48: broke up with my gf because of her BPD, am I in the wrong?

I broke up with my girlfriend because she was manic and I didn’t know she had bipolar

I started dating this girl and a few weeks into it she told me she loved me and started acting very manic —- then she blocked me and a week later unblocked me to text me from the hospital and let me know that she blocked me because someone told her I had a girlfriend…

I didn’t visit her in the hospital and shortly after I told her I wasn’t ready for a relationship. We continued to text after and I stopped responding as much eventually and started to avoid her.

 it was a lot for me to deal with and I really did love her as well but it was just a lot, I told her I wasn’t ready for a relationship but she keeps texting me. 

She’s only 19 and I’m 48 and I didn’t know she was 19 when we first met … it was at a techno party and I ended up giving her some mdma and we hit it off and slept together the same night.

She didn’t look 19 at all and she had her own apartment and job so she was pretty independent but it makes me feel a bit weird as well.

"My boyfriend (21M) and I (19M) have been together for 11 months, and it's been great, he's loving, supportive and I couldn't ask for a better partner. Recently though, it feels like our relationship has gone downhill due to the extreme lack of sex we're having. We're both polyamourous, and we both have our own separate hook ups regularly, almost always with protection. At some point recently though, he caught 2 STIs. He has now been treated for both of them, and has been given the all clear since he re-tested, I caught one of them from him and have also been through treatment now.

 But over this period of time, we have had absolutely no sex whatsoever, which I understand is because both him and I had STIs, but even non-penetrative stuff we used to do completely halted, and I haven't had even so much as a handjob for a month and a half. We're both fine and clean now, and still we haven't resumed our sex life. The few times I have mentioned something because I don't want to pester him about it or make him feel pressured to, he's kind of grunted at me and not actually communicated as to why he won't return to how we were. I don't consider myself to be a shallow person, and I love him very very much, but honestly the lack of sex is leading to a lack of attraction to him.

 Sex is a very important part of relationships to me, but I grew up with a very damaged view of sex and I feel like I'm returning to that view due to lack of intimacy/sensuality with him. I'm not blaming him for this at all, I know it's not his fault and the last thing I want to do is make him feel obligated to have sex with me if he doesn't want to, but hearing him talk about wanting to fuck others whilst he won't even touch me like that, is making me feel extremely unwanted, disgusted at myself and disgusted at him. My self confidence has completely dipped within this month, and I feel like the only way to feel wanted by someone is to have meaningless hookups. As much as I don't want it to happen, I know at some point I will just stop asking and stop wanting it, and then if he does return to wanting sex from me I won't actually be attracted to him sexually.

Maybe he is just not attracted to me anymore. I know it's not a problem with sex itself because he's talked about wanting to screw multiple people and has also received head and similar from others since testing clean, and I'll admit I have put on a little weight recently.

TL;DR : Bf (21M) of 11 months won't engage in any sexual activity with me (19M) since both having STIs (now both confirmed clean), but happy to screw others.

"You are not shallow for wanting sex.

Ask him point blank what the problem is. Not a casual mention, not a hint, flat look him in the eyes and ask him when he intends to resume that part of your relationship. If he still has a reason for delaying, great, he can tell you about it so you're not just hanging. If he doesn't have a reason, one of you two needs to initiate and get something done here.

If he doesn't have a reason *and* he turns you down if you initiate, the relationship has probably run its course and it's time to leave."	MaybeSomethingLess	reply	na	na	na	0.9978519678115845	weak	no	no	na	relationships
"We’re doing long distance for a year already. We met through my mutual friend and we eventually got off. His place is like 2-3 hours away from me if you have a car, which is in my case i do. We’re both in uni as well. Our lifestyle isn’t much the same, I am more well-privileged however I don’t mind since we’re both teenagers. It’s like I provide money and love, and he provides love. Also, the reason why I’m thinking of a breakup is every time I share a problem it feels like he doesn’t care as long as he’s not involved. And when I try to reciprocate his energy, I’m being careless for not comforting him. Also, I have a lot of friend groups but he only has a little. He opened up he’s not comfortable with me hanging out with them and we need to spend time more. I’m slightly annoyed because I respect his time when he’s out with friends so I think he needs to respect mine as well that’s basic human decency. But I have to understand because he doesn’t have a lot of friends he can hangout with and he is clingy as well. And of course, there was a time I shared my interests to him, how I like it so much and he just moved to a topic he can relate to again. I love him but I think it’s being too much. I want this to workout but LDR is har work. we’re both teens, we can’t adjust to something when we’re still building our future. Do you guys think I should break up or talk about it?

"Long story short, I’ve worked in financial services industry since i graduated college. I’ve done sales in person and remote. This week I had to quit my job because it was starting to get to me mentally. I wanted time discover what I want my life to look like. If I want to work full time, or if I want to work for myself, or do I want to work part time and start a family. My fiancé works as a full time  instructional designer. He also has a side business where he does contract work. In the meantime, we decided if I got him contracts I would get a commission. My social media accounts have great genuine connections from  my financial sales background; so I know what I am doing. Today I decided to edit his company social media pages so I can start networking. My fiancé goes, well I don’t think it’s a good idea to use a picture of ourselves, we should just use a company logo. I said I know what I am doing, people want to see a face. He goes “you said it yourself, when people see you they don’t take you seriously. It’s because your a young women and you are beautiful” That really bothered me. I woke up today confident that I would get some contracts, but it brought me back to my time in  financial sales. I was always flirted with, women would treat me like I am untrustworthy, people believed I got everything because I’m“pretty” male coworkers would try to flirt with me or were just aggressive. I remember overhearing female coworkers talking about me and my clothing when everything I wore was professional. A female coworker who I thought we had a good relationship would make comments at lunch like “ugh, now your deciding to wear makeup?!”

I had male coworkers not want to mentor me because I’d make their wives feel uncomfortable. I’d try to make professional connections and men would be there just to talk to me. It made me feel like I don’t have a shot. I started to doubt my own abilities and gave up. So when my fiancé made that comment, it really bothered me. I just gave up. Eventually I’d just become quiet and put my head down and work. I started having anxiety and wanted to be left alone. But then it turned to, “oh she is stuck up”. Its been a week since I have worked. I am starting to feel like I am not good at anything. Maybe I don’t see myself, but I guess I am considered pretty. It makes me feel uncomfortable when people comment on my looks. My looks aren’t something I really focus on. I’m actually quite quiet and A type personality. I’m just feeling really down. I’m starting to feel guilty now. Like everything I have is because of my apparent looks. Like having the option to stay at home is because of this so called “pretty privilege” I don’t know I am feeling really down now. I already struggle to feel good about the way I look, but then I get treated like I am delusional. I don’t like talking about it because I get comments like “whatever” “shut up” “your not that pretty anyway” And before anyone blames me, no I do not wear makeup or provocative clothing. I wear my hair in a ponytail everyday. I don’t feel seen. It makes me feel useless. My fiancé apologized, but it just brought up old feelings.

"Earlier this year my boyfriend and I were laying in bed and I took a picture of myself on his phone. I didn’t like it so I deleted it and went to recently deleted to fully delete it. However, as soon as I went into the recently deleted it was full of nude images of random women. My stomach immediately dropped. We ended up talking it out. He said he didn’t know why he did it and it was something he has done in his other relationships. In the end he said he would stop and he was so upset he made me feel insecure. I thought all was well but recently he was acting weird. My gut told me to look through his phone (I know this is an invasion of privacy but I couldn’t help but know what was going on).

While there was nothing in his photos, I ended up going to files and that’s when I found more nude pictures saved within the last two months. He also had a picture of his penis. I am unsure if he was sending it to anywhere. I am so confused if I should even speak up about it because I don’t know if it will hurt our relationship. We just recently moved in together with our cat really close to our college.

TL;DR: my boyfriend has continued to save nude photos of random women. he told me he would stop and didn’t mean to hurt me. after a few months I felt something was wrong and went through his phone to find multiple nude photos.

doesn't matter why he did it, he has saved photos of other nude women. our porn brain rotted society thinks that its unreasonable to ask from a man to advert his full sexual attention onto you. it is not normal to find naked photos of other people on your partner's phone. unless he's an artist who draws nude models as a job/hobby and saves nude photos of women, i would give him the benefit of the doubt, but i dont think you mentioned he is. you can do much better than that honey, you should have an open conversation about it and set boundaries. personally, never been a fan of porn (many reasons) and my partner watching it, and asking from someone to stop doing it is the bare minimum they can do. masturbating doesnt have to mean watching porn/photos/videos of naked people	Confident-Serve8297	reply	na	na	na	0.9947376847267151	no	no	no	na	relationships

"Two and a half years ago my mom (52F) began dating a guy (28M) she met online. At first I was happy for her despite the large age gap. My brother (17M) however was not and when my mom started bringing this guy around, my brother was hostile. She moved him in without telling us 5 months after they started dating. It was incredibly awkward for us as this guy has a job where he gets summers off. So days when I wasn’t working I was inside a house with a man I barely know. 

However, after a few months while my brother still disliked him, he stopped being outwardly rude. But this was replaced by our mom’s boyfriend becoming hostile towards him. He began picking on my brother for pretty much no reason- demanding he get a job, stop doing “useless things” (his hobbies), telling him all the chores he does around the house are just “easy bullshit” etc. This guy doesn’t financially support us in any way and he lives with our mom rent free. So in my opinion he had absolutely no right to talk.

This also bothered me because my brother has a mental disability and has struggled his entire life. He had a hard upbringing with the adults in our life not understanding his disability. This guy would openly insult my brother in front of my mom and she did not do a damn thing about it. This really bothered me but I bit my tongue regardless. Christmas Eve 2021 and the Super Bowl 2022 were completely horrible nights with this guy instigating with my brother for pretty much no reason. My mom also brought this guy to our birthday celebrations and even my grandfather’s (who he didn’t even know) funeral. He literally went on his phone when my family sing happy birthday to me. 

Back in April of this year, I had enough. My mom doesn’t like people wearing shoes in the house which is fine. However, I was coming inside for about two seconds to let my brother know my dad and I were here to pick him up. This guy rudely told me that “taking my shoes off is not that hard”. I blew up on him and pretty much told him to go fuck himself and date a woman his own age. I also told him off for how he treats my brother and he excused himself by saying he is “just trying to help”. I do not buy this at all. I was expecting to get in trouble over this but luckily I didn’t. My mom made him apologize to my brother the next day. 

This guy went quiet for a bit until June when he started again. This time he was going after both my brother and I. He wouldn’t say anything directly, instead he would walk around the house, talking to himself and mocking us. Saying that we “don’t want to grow up” and that I “need to ask my daddy to take me to work” and that we hit up our dad for cash. First of all, no I don’t drive much due to anxiety but I pay for my own public transportation and don’t ask anyone to take me anywhere. I do get rides from my dad or boyfriend if they offer but that’s it. Also my brother and I have NEVER asked either of our parents for money. I’ve paid my own way through college. He would usually do this weird talking to himself early in the morning when he thought we were sleeping. 

One morning when he was doing it I went downstairs to confront him but he had left for work. So instead I told my mother what happened. She said she’s sorry that this is happening again. I guess she had a talking to with him but I don’t really know. Neither my brother nor I received an apology from him for this. Another issue with him is that he glared at us around the house, as if we aren’t supposed to be there. He would do this to our significant others as well. 

Anyway he went quiet again for a bit until I went on vacation last month to see my boyfriend’s family. While I was away, this guy went up to my brother’s door and started insulting him. He told my brother that he’s going to be “in bed until 2 PM jerking off” then said “Remember when you harassed me, b*tch?” and punched my brother’s door. My brother went downstairs to confront him and my mom apparently went off on this guy. She said if he transgresses again then he’s out of the house. I should also add that my mom has a mentally ill sister who’s been having a breakdown. So he chose to provoke my brother while all that was happening. 

Ever since then, he hasn’t done anything outwardly to us. Instead he’s actually acting nice to us. But I really don’t buy it. I think he’s only “sorry” for what he did because he was reprimanded. This week him and my mother went on a vacation to a foreign country and got engaged there. If she was with a better person, I’d be happy for her. But I cannot be happy about her marrying this person.

It's obvious he'd like you and your brother to live somewhere else.  He'd have more opportunity to control your mother if you weren't there observing.

He has all the hallmarks of a con artist who gains the trust of an older woman by pretending to be romantically interested in them, then proceeds to access their cash and assets, often ripping them off and taking everything they have before disappearing.

If you and/or your brother can afford a private investigator to find out if he has a criminal past, or is already married, or has run a romance scam on other women, your money will bve well spent.

"You don't have to fake being happy about this. I wouldn't, not with my freaking mom. No, she gets emotional honesty from me, like it or not lol.

From what you describe, your mother has adopted a third adult child. He doesn't help around the house. He picks fights with the other kids and she has to come play referee.

He is projecting like a fuckin movie theatre too. *He's* the one with a sugar mama, but he accuses you of taking money from your actual father? Lmfao. This is what the kids call a ""cope"". He's ashamed of his lifestyle but his ego can't take it, so he picks on other people to soothe himself.

In this sub, we often talk about how no well-adjusted 50-something would date a kid in their 20s. We don't often say the inverse, but it's also true -- no well-adjusted 20-something would date an old person in their 50s. There's something really wrong with this guy. Maybe he's a grifter. Maybe he's a run-of-the-mill abuser and your mom is presently a convenient target. Punching a wall isn't exactly a sign of great character -- I know because I've done it, and at that point in my life, I was a dumpster fire of a human being.

If your mom continues to prioritize this leechy little boy over her actual children, she's going to lose you two. She needs to wake up to that fact. He isn't worth it. So yeah, I don't recommend you fake happiness here."	c1nnamonbunny	reply	na	na	na	0.9994372725486755	no	strong	no	na	relationships

"I (F21) am dating a guy (M24), he has always lived on this farm that he grew up on and he comes from a wealthy family, it is only now that I've been with him that he has started looking at doing courses to work, but other than that most of his needs are met by his father who provides him with everything.

I am studying at university and I chose a uni closer to him even though I would prefer to live up where my dad lives (in another state) and go to university there. This is because my family are immigrants and my mum, my dad and my sister are the only family I have, my mum left us and we don't have much of a relationship with her and so my only support system is my dad and sister who live together. I've had a lot of trauma being in the area that I live now and my dream is to build a life closer to my dad and sister (but not too far from my partner's family and home, so that he doesn't end up feeling isolated either) and hopefully find a job there. I've talked to my boyfriend about making plans for the future, but it seems he wants to stay where he is and whenever I voice that my needs are to make a home with him somewhere I'm comfortable, he shuts down this talk with saying ""well I don't know the future so I can't say."" I've told him before that these needs are important to me and if he doesn't feel comfortable making plans around potentially moving in the future with me, then he should just end the relationship.
because I know for sure I just do not want to be here but am willing to work with it now so that I can be closer to him, as he feels that if I moved in with my dad now then our relationship would not work as a long distance one. He often disregards me saying he doesn't want to break up and it's because he doesn't know what the future holds, but I mention he should try make plans for the future if he wants to be with me and he disregards it. 

I know change is a big thing for him and I have tried to explain that with relationships come change, and he has to be willing or open to making new plans for the future, I've given him the option of calling things off if it's too much for him, yet he won't and leaves me in the dark. Is what I'm asking of him normal in an established relationship? I feel like if he truly loved me he would consider planning our lives together in the future to be important, but it seems he just wants me to stick around while he continues to live the way he always has.

TL;DR: I feel as though I'm asking too much of my boyfriend to make plans for the future with me, I've told him to end things if he isn't comfortable with change but it seems he wants to keep me around without making any real plans for our future, even though this is essential for me as I crave stability due to past traumas."	finn_3012	post	14.030165906235409	female	White	0.9980466365814209	na	na	na	8	relationships
"He isn't someone who likes change so you told him he needs to initiate the break up? That makes no sense. To answer the question in the title, yes, you expect too much from him. He isn't going to magically turn into the person you want him to be. This is who he is. Love him for who he is or leave him.

"If you truly loved him you would also respect his choices to stay near his family, your trauma doesn't trump his choice. You're also putting the brunt of the relationship on him by making it only his choice to break up, if you feel like you need to break up just do it yourself.

Also the fact that you are attending university but thinking about moving back home is a big red flag, going to college/university is the time in your life when you need to experience that separation from your immediate family. Being homesick is totally normal, but your education is also something that you need to consider before deciding to move back home.

"Talking about what each person wants in the future is important. He just might not have a clear idea what he wants or has a hard time promising something if the execution of that plan is too far out.

Plans aren't always set in stone. How solid the plans should be depends on how long you've been dating. Earlier things are the more vague they're going to be.

Asking for a break up if it's too much isn't going to go anywhere because that's just more pressure. Start with something more vague and less committal. Maybe figure out if he would be willing to move at all ever."	finn_3012	reply	na	na	na	0.9980466365814209	no	no	no	na	relationships

Both of you want to be close to your families, and that's understandable, but I don't see a current solution where you're both on the same page here since your families are so far apart. I think he knows what he wants for his future, but he doesn't want to hurt your feelings. He's comfortable with how things are right now. How long have you two been together? Because you seem to be wanting to have a lot of serious long-term commitment type talks with someone who might not be mentally and/or emotionally ready to have them. 

How long are you in school for? Is this conversation now that pressing of a matter? If you have another 4+ years of university left, why discuss a major life change now and not later on? What about starting simple or smaller? Because if you can't figure our how to work a partnership with the little things, the big things like where you live, if you want marriage and kids, how you want to parent if you have kids..  it all won't naturally fall into place. It's like trying to a piece of a 1000 piece puzzle into a 10 piece puzzle. You won't be able to create your big picture with the wrong pieces.

If you're enjoying your time with him, don't worry about the future too much.

"She’s 37 with 2 kids (4 and 7). I’m 34 with my first newborn.  
We use to be coworkers about seven years ago. Since then, we met up maybe once, but we text often. In the beginning, she sends me holiday texts, promo codes to free low-price items or something like a Target cup or coffee. I respond with a thank you and ask how’s she’s doing.  
From time to time, I vent to her about inflation, pregnancy and childbirth, and expensive housing. She engages.  
Anyway, she manages to slide in website links asking for $$ contributions to her kids’ college tuition when we text about the economy.  
A couple years ago, she married. I gifted $100. She prob forgot that I gifted her. A couple months ago, I had a baby shower with a registry. She didn’t give a gift nor did she attend. I understand she can’t make it because it would be a five hour plane ride. Nevertheless, I was disappointed that she didn’t give me any love (gift) from my baby shower when I gifted her $100.  So I move on from the disappointment.  Yet, she sends me links asking me to contribute to her kids college tuition.   
Otherwise, she’s a great texter.  
Thoughts?  
To add: my household income is higher but we also have higher housing expenses/maintenance, so I can see why she sends me links asking for $. However, I just had my own kid (newborn) who I have to pay for college. I respect her hustle for asking, but what should I do? Ignore her links or tell her to stop sending it to me? I don’t want to give her $ and I like to keep the texting friendship

Guy 1 : I dated him for 5-6 years in college, he was not the best boyfriend initially and that made me fall out of love with him but by the end of it he became very available and started  prioritizing me. It was too late for me to feel the same way again, so we broke up. Our future goals differed - I am very passionate about my career and may not want to have kids (may change my mind later) he definitely wants to. 
However we still kept in touch and he was always there for me emotionally and is doing well for himself. 

Guy 2   : Couple of months after I broke up with my ex, I hooked up with a friend of mine. We had been friends in college and grew closer after I broke up. His ambitions and hobbies were very similar to mine - in terms of having kids etc. But he always seemed very emotionally unavailable, so I backed off. I wasn’t ready for a serious relationship so I always felt like I didn’t give him proper chance.  He told me to contact him again if I ever want to give it a shot, but we shouldn’t be friends otherwise so we haven’t spoken for months now. 

They have both expressed they want to be with me and I have been thinking about this for months and I keep going back and forth. I have taken months to myself, gone to therapy, tried dating apps but can’t seem to come to a resolution. Has anyone ever been in this situation or have any advice? Thank you!

TL;DR : Guy 1 is my ex very emotionally available but long term goals differ about kids, guy 2 is my friend who I hooked up with goals are similar, both want to be with me I don’t know what to decide."

Sounds like neither of them are a good fit if you can't make a decision after months. I'd probably try meeting new people instead of staying tangled with guys that weren't a good fit once already.

"Context: We've been together 8 months, they moved in together last October. Christine (his roommate) has a boyfriend, Jon, that she started dating in October as well. My bf, Hector, and her have known each other for about 3 years and are mutual friends with 2 of his best friends. My bf and I have known each other for 16 years, but have never been super close until we got together.  
  
Here's a few things I found weird:  
  
When we first got together and he told me about his roommate, I was excited to meet her. The first few times I went over he would text me that I was gonna get to meet her, I'd come in and she had fled to her room. One day I was over, she came in the house, saw me and just said ""Oh. Hi."" went to the bathroom for like 10 minutes, came out and just talked to Hector. She didn't introduce herself to me or anything and barely spoke to me.  
  
She has a small business where she sells these little things that she makes. Since Hector and I have been together, she's had about 4 events selling these things and we've gone to every one and I've bought things every time we go. I followed her small business instagram and she followed me back (this was about 7 months ago). Just a few weeks ago out of nowhere, she unfollowed me, but still follows a few of Hector's other friends who she barely knows.  
  
There's been a few times where something small happens in her life and she'll mope around and start crying. It has started to feel like when Jon isn't around, she uses Hector as a shoulder to cry on and it has made me massively uncomfortable. It would be one thing if they were just friends, or just roommates, but it feels as though she is blurring the lines of boundaries a lot.  
  
She went to go meet Jon's family for the first time a few weeks ago. She was very different after that. Then last week she asked Hector to move out and gave a really lousy excuse as to why and then started crying because she ""felt bad"" (which I feel were tears of manipulation tbh)  
  
She would walk around the house in a towel a lot or in her underwear, or make sexual jokes like joking about accidentally leaving her vibrator out or talk about her and Jon having sex explicitly to Hector.  
  
She has a history of developing feelings for past roommates.  
  
She's always given me a weird feeling and I always had wondered if she had an emotional crush on Hector. I kind of wonder if Jon and her had a serious talk or something and that's why she asked Hector to move out. What do you all think?  
  
TLDR; My boyfriend has a roommate who has a history of developing feelings for past roommates. She is very weird towards me regardless of my several attempts at trying to get to know her. She uses my boyfriend for emotional fulfillment when her boyfriend isn't around. She met her boyfriend's family for the first time and came home and asked my boyfriend to move out with a very fake excuse as to why."

"Hey guys, I'm in need of some advice about a situation that I cannot stop ruminating on and is really starting to get me down, so I'm trying to focus on changing my behaviour and improving it for the future. It's a bit of a long read, sorry in advance! 

My gf (27F) and I (28f) are in a group of friends, and are the only girl/girl relationship in the group, meaning my gf hangs out with us often. 

I am really self conscious now (wish I realised it a lot sooner) that I have been quite abrasive toward my gf in front of my friends. I wish I had more self awareness and self control at the time, but at the times this has occurred, i had been going through a really rough personal time since we got together, resulting in me being more sensitive, irresponsible and having less self awareness. 

This behaviour spanned from about a year ago now up until very recently, and last month is when I think I noticed friends giving each other looks about it, and even a couple of snide comments from one friend that indicate that she thinks I may be mean to my gf.

It's a very long story, but the start of our relationship was very turbulent and tough for both of us as she was still going through a major separation involving an emotionally abusive ex bf, financial abuse etc. Many things about this put major strain on the relationship early on, which I now know caused some resentment in me, probably causing me to be more abrasive toward her in front of people than I usually would. 

To provide some context on me - this is not behaviour I have ever exhibited before toward anyone, private or in public. Friends know me and often used to cite me as ""extremely kind to everyone"". 

I've caught wind of a friend making a couple of comments and 2 friends giving each other knowing looks recently, and it has caused me to reflect A LOT and gain clarity, and its making me feel really awful and guilty. My gf is honest with me and has never expressed anything about this, because she thinks because we are all close friends, it's natural to see couples sometimes bicker. What I'm concerned and over thinking about is what my friends now think of me. I'm extremely worried that my friends think im mean, and I've become a hostile person. 

An example of me picking up on friends perception of the situation is this:

I was hanging out with my 2 best friends and we were talking about how being consistently late is rude. I then told them about how I had recently stopped driving my gf to work because she had caused me to be late every day for a week and her lateness isn't getting better no matter how hard I try. My gf agreed and was sorry, and that was that. Anyway, upon reflection, I think my friends think that this is harsh of me, because when my gf mentioned to them (in a joking manner) that I was having a go at her for being late earlier that day - those 2 friends gave each other a very knowing look. I then tested the situation by saying  ""I wasn't having a go at you!"" And one of the friends simply looked away with a snarky look on her face.

 After reflecting on this, I recalled another incident where one of those friends and I were at a concert a week after I told them about my gfs lateness. I told the friend how the upcoming song at the concert was about ""when your friend has a shitty boyfriend"" and she said ""oh, like you?"" . We were a little tipsy, but still, everything considered, I think this comment may have meant something, as in, I am the ""shitty boyfriend"". 

I know I can't change the past, and I wish I could go back, be less abrasive in public and frankly, tell my friends less about the relationship, because i feel as though I have put it under the microscope a little. 


My plan now is to ensure there is NO negative interaction between my gf and I in front of friends, and for me to be less sensitive, have more awareness, and only be positive and kind. This is also part of a larger journey pf getting back to my old, more positive and kind self. I know I know to work on myself and I'm not proud. 

My biggest question here is - for reasonable people, is it possible that my future improved behaviour changes my friends perception of me and my relationship? I really need to let go of obsessing over these negative thoughts and beating myself up. I somehow can't stand the thought of my best friends thinking that I'm in a shitty relationship, that I'm a shitty girlfriend, or anything like that. My friends love me and they're reasonable, but they know I'm sensitive so would probably never bring this up first.

Thanks in advance, any advice or insight is super appreciated. And again, I am aware of my poor behaviour and am fully focussed on becoming better, so please hold off any harsh comments about my character.

tldr: I think I've been abrasive toward my gf in front of friends, and now I'm worried that friends think im a bad person. I want to change and change their perceptions."	galsjustwannahavefun	post	37.530313130199794	male	White	0.00922546535730362	na	na	na	15	relationships
Wait, your gf suffered abuse and your reaction is to be so consistently mean to her that other people have started to notice? I think you may have bigger problems than your friends' opinions.	galsjustwannahavefun	reply	na	na	na	0.00922546535730362	no	no	strong	na	relationships

"Other comments need to stop calling you a man.  

That being said, how you treated her means you actually have been a bad girlfriend and trying to be better solely for optics is a terrible approach. Fix how you treat your girlfriend for her sake and your own personal growth, not image. If you legitimately become a better girlfriend, it will show. It will take time. There are no shortcuts. You can admit your mistakes openly and apologize to the group, but that only means something if you've changed and maintain that change. You do need to admit your mistakes and apologize to your GF now though.   

In short, recognize your fault, accept that your intent doesn't make what happened acceptable, and improve your actions."	galsjustwannahavefun	reply	na	na	na	0.00922546535730362	no	no	no	na	relationships
"Sure, people can change their minds when they see changes happen.

With that said, are you the shitty girlfriend?

Are your interactions with your gf in front of your friends that different from what they are in private? If yes, then why? If not, then maybe you should talk to someone you trust about it because you might be missing something? There are a lot of crappy partners out there that don't think they're crappy partners, that think everything is going along fine. It's also very easy for people that have gotten out of relationships with abusive partners to think that merely ""crappy"" is great, so IDK if your gf's subjective experience is the best barometer.

It's not necessarily the case, but I think as a lot of people have noted in the thread, the way you are framing this (a problem of what your friends think) is odd. It might bear with some reflection, everything could actually be fine and it's just a weird situation that people are exaggerating in their heads, but some self-reflection never hurts."	galsjustwannahavefun	reply	na	na	na	0.00922546535730362	weak	no	strong	na	relationships
"I think the problem here is that you straight up just said” my plan now is to ensure that there is no negative interaction between me and my girlfriend in front of friends. “

You are not even saying in general …you are literally just saying in front of friends.. which is just a big faker thing to do 🤷‍♀️ trying to put on a show so that your friends have a better opinion of you and your relationship so don’t think that you are a major d*ck isn’t gonna work. The truth is that people- especially ones that have known you for long enough can see right through that sh*t! And if you just start hanging out with them with a completely new demeanor acting like Mr. nice guy- It’s going to be even more of a red flag. I think that the best way to deal with the situation is to have a man-to-man Conversation and just be like listen bro I just wanted to say that I’ve been working on myself a lot lately and some thing I noticed was how I treated her around you guys and it was really fucked up and I apologized to her but I also want you guys to know that I’m working on myself and I’m treating her better behind closed doors and that shit wasn’t cool.

"Your friends don't want to think you are a bad partner. If you change, they will happily accept this.

Having said that, your reasoning is flawed. You shouldn't not want to treat your gf poorly because others will judge you.

"We are currently on holiday with my gf. We have been dating for around 3-4 months. Although we broke up for 2-3 weeks cuz she claimed she was unsure of her feelings and there were no problems with me. I responded calmly and gave her my best wishes. After that 3 weeks, he wanted to hang out again so we did. Now we are on holiday and she existed at first. However, she is now in a kind of depression. She said she has never spent so much time with someone. I was always nice and always understanding. She started crying and could manage to get very few words out of her. But while asking what was the problem and did she had similar problems she said she didn't have excitement and doesn't know why. She is crying and said she didn't have similar problems with her ex’s. I asked her if she used to love them more and she said maybe. We argued and she cried a lot when I tried to give her space and to go out and grab a beer alone. I asked her if my attention was easy to earn and was this the problem cuz I never played games. She said no. She is now next to me watching some tv comedies. What should I do? Should I break up?

TL;DR: she is pretending we are good again and wants to go out. Should I give her space or should I break up?"	AlpolsunUnde	post	29.15821012258063	male	White	0.9988287091255188	na	na	na	6	relationships
"Yikes. I think that because you are on vacation that you sort of HAVE to ride it out together because it would be dangerous honestly to just like leave her and go get your own room or something like that, you never know who knows that you guys were together and who would know that she was alone if you did that. 

It definitely sounds like this relationship needs to come to an end whenever you get back from the vacation. I think you should just say to her  , “hey listen -I don’t want to fight about this anymore ,we can do this really maturely. I don’t feel like you are in a position to be in a relationship again based on what you have told me. It sounds like you’ve got a lot of trauma from your ex and I’m sorry about that, but I don’t deserve to be treated like I’m him. you are not showing me that you are happy in this relationship at all and I am not going to stay with someone who is miserable with me. I’m 28 years old I could tell when the vibe is off. We are supposed to be enjoying ourselves and in the honeymoon stage of our relationship-we have only been together for four months and clearly if this is how we feel so soon in- it’s not meant to be. I don’t want to be in a relationship like this  and that’s it. I’m sorry that this didn’t work out and I did not give you the ability to be comfortable with me like you clearly need. so I will give you your space for the remaining time on this vacation ,but please don’t fight me on it.

When you say holiday I don't know if you're talking about a vacation or like we think in America, regulated break in work. So I don't know if you're talking about expensive trip or you are just staying together in a local place.

I would tell her what you are going to do to limit your usage and she can decide for herself if she wants to follow suit or not.

You have to decide if your feelings about social media are important enough to you that being incompatible on this is a dealbreaker.

If you’re just worried about possible future issues, deal with those when they happen.

Then you need to be very explicit about what and why but be prepared that she will disagree. Comparing what? Just general fomo seeing what others are doing? At that point it may just be that you aren't actually compatible if she finds herself unhappy generally. I think if you want to stay in this relationship though you have to accept that she likely won't agree to what you are asking as it does come off more controlling than anything.

"I am 20F. I not sure about my sexuality. I think I am bisexual and I am exploring still. I have not yet talked to anyone about it really cause I am scared I will get judged.

My family is well not totally modern but they are open minded enough. But I am really afraid of their reactions and well Idk if I am really ready to tell anyone.

Me and my bff(19f) have known each other for years. While I never particularly thought about her in a romantic or sexual way, I definitely found her good looking but I never tried to hint anything.

She is in a committed relationship but she's not really ready to do anything with him. She doesn't even feel comfortable enough to kiss him. But one day, she came up with a proposal for me, she said that she wanted to explore physical things with me cause she's comfortable with me, and for some reason she thought and still thinks this doesn't count as cheating.

I told her this is a crazy idea. We talked more about it. I finally confessed to her that I want explore things with a girl and she said that we should do it together. She doesn't know I am bi, she thinks it's just about exploring for me. 

Now, I didn't want to indulge in this cause I didn't really want to sleep with her but I have a bit of a people pleasing problem and I said yes. We made plans but she backed off last minute and I was totally ok with it, I was glad she backed off. 

But I went to her home to hang out one day and that day her parents also went out, so we were alone. She again starts talking about sleeping together and my people pleasing problem kicks in and instead of denying, I said let's see where this goes and well long story short, I slept with her. Honestly she kinda pressured me cause I really didn't want to. But I did it anyway cause I didn't want to disappoint her.(I am a huge sub and she dominated me so my brain kinda went blank).

Later, I felt really guilty when her boyfriend came over just 20 minutes after we slept togather and was his cheery usual self. She made him leave early and then we decided to talk about what happened. She said that we should keep doing this cause it's fun and it's not like she's cheating. So I told her let's just see what we can do, let's not get too ahead with it. 

Then I come back home and she messages me that we shouldn't do this again. So, I told her that yep let's not do this again. I was again happy that the problem got solved on it's own.

A few days pass and she starts acting weirdly with me. She doesn't talk to me at all. Like usually we used to be on call for hours but now she completely ignores me. Won't answer my calls or call me back. I thought ok I will give it a few days. 

Then one week later, she messages me again that she wants to sleep with me again. This time I refuse and tell her that it being a one time thing is better for both of us. She agrees that yeah one time thing is probably better. 

And now again she's ignoring me. I really don't want to call her up and tell her to get her shit together. But this is also taking a toll on me cause she's my bff and I really don't want to lose her this way. 

TL;DR - slept with my bff, then she ignored me; asked me to sleep to her again, I refused and now she's ignoring me again and it's making me sad.

Edit - thank you for all the replies everyone.

This made me really think about our dynamic. I realised that my feelings have never really mattered to her. I have always been someone, who she, told her feelings about cause she knew I knew I would never actually judge her. There have been several accounts of her ignoring me for her other friends or making me feel like I am less.

I come from a really fucked up back as I already said. I am still stuck in the fucked up situation (I will make a post about it if any of you want to know. It's a long story.)
She's someone who helped me through this so she matters a lot to me ig.

I don't have lots of people in life. It's my fucked up parents, my life source aka my brother, my bff who I slept with, my other bff who's in another city now and a guy I like, that's it. I have really huge trust issues so I push people away. 

So, my bff is ig really important to me, so important that I have overlooked all her faults. But yeah she has not been the best friend to me that I have been to her.

And I know my people pleasing problem and other things doesn't make me a victim in this whole thing. I made a mistake that I can't fix cause I can't tell her bf. She pressured me into ig, and ig me being a love sick person took whatever I could get. I am really ashamed of what I did. 

I have talked to her today about it, more like tried to. She ofc didn't ask me shit about my feelings and only talked about herself. I am going to try and distance myself from her and her bf and focus on myself. 


Thank you everyone for the advices given😊."	Medium_War_1335	post	25.006329044242058	female	White	0.004637795966118574	na	na	na	58	relationships
"Yeah, unfortunately your hook up has completely changed the dynamic of the relationship. You're no longer just platonic best friends, you were platonic best friends who had sex to explore your feelings and the physical connection of being with another woman. And let's make this completely clear, she absolutely cheated on her boyfriend and you went along with it. Don't downplay how you're a sub or whatever, you knew the situation you were in and went with it. Others might want to focus a bit more on the cheating aspect and possibly coming clean to the boyfriend, I'll focus more on your relationship with your friend.

You need to have a conversation about your thoughts on the matter. Explain how you already sort of knew you were bisexual, and that you allowed yourself to explore this side with her because of your established connection. However, this was wrong to do while she is committed to another person and that it cannot be done again as long as they are together. Imagine how she would feel if he were having sex with another guy for the sake of experimentation and rationalized it as not cheating.

Things will be awkward for a little bit. You both are grappling with this change in dynamic of your relationship, so give her some space. Makes complete sense she is withdrawn a little. You two completely flipped the relationship on its head with your actions, don't try and pretend like nothing's changed and you can act like the friends you've always been. You two need to figure this out first.

Unfortunately, there's not much you can do when she's ignoring you, other than to ask her not to ignore you. But like I said, leave her be for a little bit. Tell her you want to talk about things thoroughly, but are willing to wait when she is ready. Until then, just be chill, and hope for the best."

"So many issues with this. 

1) This is cheating. She’s made the commitment to her partner, but it’s also setting you up for heartbreak. She knows this, and you probably know this too, but she chose to pursue it anyway. This says a lot about her as a person. Why would you even want to hook up with that kind of person let alone be their friend?

2) She clearly wants to have her cake and eat it too. She wants a side piece girl and to keep her boyfriend. Life doesn’t work that way.

3) Its okay to be bisexual. It’s okay to experiment. It’s not an excuse to hurt people and lie to people.

4) She pressured you. You call her your BFF but she pressured and manipulated you. That’s no friend. 

5) Only hook up with friends unless you really believe it had a legitimate shot. 99% of the time it implodes the friendship. 

My suggestion? Stop helping her cheat and accept she’s not a real friend."	Medium_War_1335	reply	na	na	na	0.004637795966118574	no	no	no	na	relationships
"My take on why she went 'weird':  She kept fishing for you to say you wanted to do it again -- then when you said you thought it should be a 'one time thing' .. she sulked / pulled away.. Only to return to suggest it again.   Bottom line: she wants this to continue and will probably manipulate you through subtle bad moods/ pulling away -- because she knows you're a people-pleaser and will eventually come around. 

I'd stay away from this situation, its going to get more toxic.   

You could benefit from a therapist to help you work on boundaries and people-pleasing nature (which can really lead to problems and resentments) -- but meanwhile with this friend i'd really put some healthy distance in there until you have the strength for solid boundaries."

It seems your bff has feelings for you. She keeps pursuing you and when you object, she ghosts you because the little voice in her is still thinking about doing the right thing by the bf.

Your bff has to make a choice. If she wants to continue the relationship with the bf, she has to confess that she CHEATED on him. Now whether he forgives her or not is up to him.

"I could be totally wrong, but this, to me, sounds like your friend is a lesbian in denial with a crush on you. She won't sleep with or even kiss her boyfriend, which makes it seem like she might not actually be sexually interested in her boyfriend. She claims it's not cheating to sleep with a woman, which could easily be a way of exploring her sexuality without admitting that she's a lesbian. She wanted to keep sleeping with you, but you said no. Then she stops talking to you for a week, possibly because she has a crush on you and felt rejected when you said no to sleeping together again. Then she reached out again, wanting to sleep together again. So, she's clearly been thinking about you and sleeping with you over that week she didn't talk to you. This truly sounds like a situation where the person hasn't even admitted their sexuality to themselves yet and is trying to pursue their crush. This seems even more plausible since you said in another comment that your friend is kind of homophobic. Many young people who are gay are ""homophobic"" before they come out. It's like a manifestation of the fear that people will find out they're gay, so they manifest homophobia to show that they're not gay because there's this incorrect thought that a homophobic person couldn't possibly be gay."

Learn from this and be a better person for yourself and others because what happened that your friend essentially cheated on her boyfriend with you and twisted it by claiming that it’s not cheating because it’s the opposite gender. 

In any romantic relationships, it’s considered cheating once you do sexual activities with another person. You’re being unfaithful to your partner at that point.

"This feels like high school me wrote this. I had a best friend, who had a boyfriend she was crazy for, but didn't want to do more with, so we fooled around, and like you, i'm a sub and at the time didn't realize how bad my people pleasing trauma response was. bc at it's heart, people pleasing is a trauma response. you learned at one point as a child, that your needs are not as important as the needs of the people around you. You maybe told yourself youre an empath or a healer or a mediator, and you're happy  to help others. its good to help others! your own needs can  wait.

whatever your sexuality is, you were used. your friend saw a chance to act out against her partner, and had you, someone who supports everything she does, and put them together. That's what happened to me. i did so much for this girl. i drove her hours to a concert i didn't have tickets for. I would go over and stay up until the early hours on a school night bc she was upset. I let her humiliate me in front of my then boyfriend. I literally  slept between her and a 30 y ear old musician she invited to play her birthday party. she told me i was her security blanket.

I haven't talked to her in over ten years. my life is better for it. she was manipulative and abusive and i let it happen for the sake of my kind of crush and the people pleasing/mediating trauma response i'd developed bc of childhood trauma.

 the point of that whole tale is, it is perfectly normal to question and explore your sexuality. but if you find yourself doing things you don't want to do for the sake of keeping the peace, you are stuck in the fawn phase of PTSD and you have other options."

"Someone should come clean to him. The next question is this are you and the boyfriend both ok with sharing her in this way?  Polyamorous relationships exist. If they are ok with that, that's always an option but honesty is even more key in those relationships. Before he agrees he has to know this happened though. So he can decide if he can trust you two again. Maybe he'll forgive it but not be cool with poly maybe the other way around. Either way being honest with him  can be seen as an attempt at being trustworthy. A tip for this admit it to him together if possible. If our of you reveals it and the other does not the one who stays silent has betrayed him and proven they are untrustworthy. That relationship will be the most strained for whoever stayed quiet. So my advice:
1 apologize together 
2 give him time and space to process
3 if he's still cool with both of you and both she and you want an arrangement where you can be partners as well suggest polyamory
4 time and space for him again

"We broke up about 5 months ago. A month ago she reached out having separated from her bf at the time but got back with him after about a week. She offered friendship which I initially declined until a few days ago.

Im torn because recently I've realized my friend group aren't as reliable as I thought and I'm moving across the country and know I'll be lonely. My ex and I shared interests we could do remotely. And I feel safe with her.

I don't think I can ever stop loving her until I meet someone else (even though it was my dumbass that ended things because I was afraid). Im confused about how to tell her that talking as friends is hurting me but I dont want to say anything to her that she doesn't need to know because I don't want to hurt her or her current relationship, even if I think its abusive.

Worse yet I'm pretty sure I'm gonna see her soon because I offered to lend her my polaroid camera I bought myself. A sexy photoshoot with one is something she wanted to do and I offered it so she could have one with her bf. I'm pretty sure Ill breakdown when I see her but don't want to not follow through with my offer.

Tldr: tried friendship with my ex but Im definitely still in love and dont want to hurt her"	Goose313	post	15.49539259317294	female	White	0.0047390153631567955	na	na	na	4	relationships
Friendship with an ex basically only works *after* you're over them. This is still too fresh for you, so friendship is not a possibility.

"You don’t want to hurt her.

I think you have your priorities mixed up.  You should be caring more about hurting YOU! You’re still very interested in her, and you’re putting yourself in these positions of being in contact with her, doing favors for her, having fun in your hobbies with her…. How do you feel after these things, when you’re alone in bed at night?  Sad, right?   I think you should do the hard thing and reduce contact with her (maybe after you get the camera back). You’ll be better off in the long run.

"I do not know if i (M23)am the abusive one or my girlfriend(F22) please help because i genuinely want to get better

I do not know if i am the abusive one or my girlfriend, please help because i genuinely want to get better

i Think my ex (F22) and i (M23) just broke off an amazing five year relationship. 

i say i think because she never explicitly said she wanted to break up, she just said that our relationship isn’t healthy and we should work on ourselves. i guess thats the modern way of a gentle break up but i honestly don’t know. 

I come from a LOT of family trauma, and i am really really bad at communicating, especially emotions. so when i tell you i dont know what something means, i am literally being so serious.

The reason for the split : i put my hands on her for the first time recently, ever in our 4 years. It happened like this …

About 7 months ago, we were in my parents house hanging out. My ex and i used to be around each other DAILY, and this day i spent house sitting for my abusive dad (🤦‍♂️).

Me and my girl were in the basement, and a disagreement in conversation came up. Looking back on it now, i can’t even remember exactly how the argument started which means the reason was too small to even fight over… But like most couples we disagreed anyways. 

Most of the time when we argue, we can come to a quick resolution, which is how we lasted so long. But this night, there wasn’t any of that. We were bickering back and forth. I do not like that, so my defense mechanism is to run from the problem. I like to create space, and give myself time to think so that i dont become overwhelmed (fighting w my ex reminded me of my parents non stop fighting- HUGE, OVERWHELMING TRIGGER!).

Most of the time my girlfriend respects the space i need, which is why i love her even now. but she was raised completely different - her first instinct is to find the root of the problem NOW and fix it. i am the opposite- i ran from any arguments and would want to be by myself. This night of our fight, the two thought process were immiscible. 

After our initial verbal disagreement , i went across the room and was silently scrolling on my phone. at this point, i am shutting down and trying to create space. She is still arguing her point, and is visibly upset by me being on my phone. I explained that i needed to be in my head for a while, not even leaving the room like how i usually do.

she then proceeded to snatch my phone out of my hand, and set it on the couch. my initial response was anger, but i know myself. i camly picked my phone back up and asked her not to do that. she then snatches my phone again and throws it across the room.

i really my tried my best to stay calm. without a word, i get up and retrieve my phone. she is still sternly talking in my face the whole time. I went on my phone again, trying to disassociate. She throws my phone a third time and the anger i had building up finally lashed out. i put my hands firmly around her neck and said “LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE DAMMIT. WHAT DONT YOU UNDERSTAND!?” 

I immediately realized what i did and apologized profusely. That moment rightfully scared her, she was afraid it would escalate if we disagree again, and i guess she was right because it would happen again. We spend a day or two apart, and we reconcile.

Fast forward to today. We are both once again in stressful life situations. Our arguments got a little louder, but the love was still there. Or so i thought, until i discovered her texting another man. Hes a coworker of hers, and the things they text to each other AT 11 PM… They were exploring each others minds. The sweet things she would say to him while giving me the not so sweet her…  it broke me. 

one day we had a disagreement, and the coworker came up as the reason for the disagreement. I was incredibly upset and angry, so once again i try to create space. I leave the house. She follows me outside, and the disagreement continues. Heres where i went wrong: i just fucking snapped. i had no control over my emotions. I pulled her hair hard, and pinned her against a wooden fence as i tell her everything wrong with her . She is genuinely telling me that they are just friends, and she can prove it. 

Believe it or not the story gets worse. its almost over, please stick with me. Immediately after this first altercation, we go back inside to look at the texts between her and her coworker. as i am trying to explain to her that this is soft cheating, she keeps speaking over me. In my manic state, I tried telling her to be quiet and let me speak. In her emotional state, she literally couldn’t stop crying and explaining herself. And this was the fatal trigger. In my mind, I had to make her stop speaking because I had a lot to talk about. And I grabbed the nearest pillow and put it over her face. I said to her “SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP!!!” and removed the pillow. she had a small cut on her bottom lip, the only scars from our entire relationship. I never even given her a bruise but i see now you just have to fuck up once.

I know I need help, but I also feel as though she has a lot to work on too. She has laid hands on me first and before. Not that it makes it any better. She is now rightfully, afraid for her well-being in my presence.

what can I work on? What can she work on? We had a really good history size for the last year. Do you think we could make this work in the future? I cannot see myself with any other woman.

TL:DR i put hands on girl for the first time in our five year relationship. I am willing to get help anyway I can I just don’t know where to begin. there is a small chance she might take me back.

Ok, let's be clear here: your girlfriend getting in your face and snatching your phone was wrong, but that is not an excuse for what you did. You could have moved away from the situation; instead, you attacked her. Furthermore, you have physically abused her on multiple occasions. It is scary to think what you might do next. If you can't be in a stressful situation without lashing out violently, then I don't think you can safely be in a relationship. Your past trauma is an explanation, not an excuse. You need to exit this relationship and get professional help.	septatrainfan	reply	na	na	na	0.9935636520385742	no	no	no	na	relationships
Both of you absolutely should stay away from each other. I don’t care if it was one time-once you cross that line of love and respect and you put your hands on your partner your relationship is literally done. It’s irreparable, I don’t care what anybody says. You are supposed to be the man in her life that loves her and protects her and treats her with the most respect and defends her and it doesn’t matter if you came from a traumatizing household or not because at 23 years old you are an adult and you have all the access to getting into therapy on your own which is covered by 99.9% of insurances- you need to take accountability for your behavior and fix the issues instead of just saying I came from trauma and I spent the day with my abusive dad :( GROW UP. And leave each other alone so that you can both grow up and live good lives someday or else you’re going to end up being 30 years old and looking back and realizing you’ve spent the last five years continuing this toxic and abusive relationship cycle.	septatrainfan	reply	na	na	na	0.9935636520385742	weak	no	no	na	relationships

It is very possible for you to be healthy, but you definitely need to actually go to therapy. The truth is that talking to your friends or family is not good enough because they are not licensed professionals. There are very specific tools and exercises that therapists give people who have grown up in abusive household or have been through some type of abuse/traumatic event. It’s called treatment for a reason. Because these exercises- like medication would help a sore throat- literally heal your brain. Until you go and spill your heart out and get to the root of your problems and have a professional work with you you will just keep going through life blaming everything on “trauma” and having a “bad childhood”. In 2023, it’s just completely unacceptable! You could have an amazing relationship and be madly in love in just five years from now if you put in the work for the next couple years. Same thing for your girl. And if you really love her you would not continue to try to force a relationship that is so clearly toxic. That stupid saying that you are a ride or die or whatever is so dumb and I wish that people did not think that they need to stick with someone just because they have been together for a long time or just because they love them. A relationship needs so much more than love. Respect. trust. Friendship. Honesty. Vulnerability.

"I (24f) have been dating my boyfriend Will (41m) for 8 months,we have known each other for a year before we started dating because he works as a mechanic and my car is a piece of junk so I always went to his shop to fix it.

He is very handsome and he looks like soldier boy so I had a crush on him,so when I bought a new car I knew I wouldn't see him as often so I asked for his number :), he accepted and after taking for a couple of months and getting close we started dating.

Now my friend Jess (23f) has an issue with my relationship, she says that our age gap is very problematic (yes ik he is a two decades older than me but it's not like I am 15 and I am turning 25 next month),and she kept making these comments about us.

I never once felt uncomfortable or nervous around him, he treats me very well and I have never been in a healthier relationship than I am right now and he respects my boundaries and supports me in everything I do

yesterday we were talking about moving in together in a city nearby where he can open his own mechanical shop and I can also start a business there,when I told my best friend she freaked out and said that this was very toxic and he was trying to lure me away from everyone I know so if he hurts me I won't have anyone to turn to.

The thing is I am the one who suggested we move and he liked the idea,I love our relationship and I love him but my best friend is making me doubt myself and my judgment.

So is my relationship with him toxic or weird in any way? I know the age gap might throw people off but I like older guys anyways and he has met me when I was 23 not 13.

TL;DR:my best friend says I am in a toxic relationship because of my age gap with my boyfriend and that he is trying to lure me away from everyone, but I can't see her point because I think our relationship is healthy."

"8 months of dating to moving to a new city and rebooting both your careers is far more concerning than the age gap. Like, that is way too soon to become absolutely dependent on each other and let go of each of your safety nets. Since he’s an experienced mechanic, he’ll probably do alright and you haven’t told us enough about your business experience and plan to get any judgement there. 

My advice is sit down with him and hash out a strong plan and start saving every penny you can. 

As for your friend, unsolicited advice is generally considered very rude. She was concerned, she expressed it, you heard it. That’s as far as it should go, but she’s pushing you away by insisting you’re making a mistake and not trusting you to make your own judgements."

8 months is pretty early to move in with someone by uprooting. Plus both of you moving just to each start your own business sounds skeptical.

Because you're likely to grow and change a tremendous amount over the next decade, compared to how much your boyfriend is, it's good to be skeptical about plans that feel like building a life together. ""Skeptical"" doesn't mean ""automatic no"" but you need to do some serious interrogating about your relationship. 8 months is still very much honeymoon phase, and it seems way too early to be talking about moving away together.

What are your respective approaches to finances? Are you both savers? Spenders? 

What about housework? Do you see him being an equal contributor, or just expecting you to do everything? How do you feel about housework? 

What about cooking?

There's a huge learning curve when living with someone for the first time. Has he ever lived with a significant other? 

Now let's add in the stress of starting businesses....

Will he expect you to let go of your own dream to help him with his? He'll naturally see his as more important since yours is admittedly a ""side business""

Seriously. You are a grown ass woman. I don't believe people should infantilize women like you as if you are incapable of making consensual and well informed decisions on your own. Could your relationship fail if you move? Sure. Could it be the best decision ever? Sure.

An age gap alone does not make a relationship toxic. It doesn't seem like your bf is making you do anything and I'm sure that he wants to just bring you along with him since he will be doing well for himself and owning his own business. That sounds ambitious to me.

Is toxic the right word? No, probably not but your friends concerns are very valid. There's a reason age gaps have such a terrible reputation, especially for people under 25 since your brains not even fully developed yet and you met this man around 22 or 23. It begs the question why this 40 year old would want to date someone with an underdeveloped brain. You may have come on to him but why would he agree to it? Add in the speed of moving in together and in a new location presumably away from support systems? Yeah major red flag. Even if it wasn't really fast, and with a massive age gap moving in together, is stressful enough, moving to a new city is also stressful enough without the freshly living together part, add in the final major major stressor that again would be massively stressful on its own of starting a business, let alone two and this situation would be hard for any couple. But you have all those stressors plus the speed of the relationship and age gap. So again, toxic may not be the right word but risky AF would probably be a fair descriptor.

He's dating a 25 year old because a 25 year old pursued HIM. When did women lose all agency? Its definitely not ideal and I get some people being weirded out, but again, she was the aggressor and seems happy so why is everyone else upset on her behalf? If she was like 18 or 19 with same gap then I would probably have a different opinion but a 25 year old is an adult. Adult enough to make a mistake and learn from it if that's what happens.

"My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 months now. It has been going really well although I am worried about his past having an affect on our relationship. When we first got together we had asked each other questions and I asked if he had ever cheated - he said he had. He said when he was younger he partied a lot and didn’t have the maturity at the time. But he said he cheated because they pushed him away and tried to change him. He said he wanted to be honest about everything with me. Of course I was very apprehensive about going into a relationship with him, I had expressed this to him and he said he understood and that I could have access to his phone. Honestly, he has been such a great boyfriend he is caring and attentive and has shown that he has changed as a person and that is something that I admire in him. He has proved that he has grown up since his 20s. I understand that we do stupid things when we are younger. Therefore, I felt relatively comfortable and trusting in him.

Until last night.. my friend (24m) who is just out of a relationship came over for a few beers with my boyfriend and I. He expressed that he might go on tinder to meet someone for sex. My boyfriends first language isn’t English so he assumed that he meant a prostitute. I corrected him and said no, however he brought up that where he is from often if you had drugs girls would come to fuck. Basically admitting that when he used to have drugs girls would fuck him to use the drugs. I instantly felt uncomfortable and angry that he had said that. I was already aware that he had a past but what he used to do is dark in my opinion. Also, I used to have problems with drugs in my early 20s which led to hospitalisation. I also have a tricky past where admittedly I was promiscuous at times which I am not proud of. I was taken advantage of course due to being under the influence. However, I never had sex for drugs I would find it low key like prostituting myself. It’s made me question who he is as a person. I feel like he took advantage of vulnerable women and it isn’t sitting right with me.  

We had a talk about it that night I cried and felt very uncomfortable. I do believe he’s changed but what if down the road he cheats or does something? I really would like to settle down and have children. Is this someone I would like to have children with? I feel upset because not only do I love him but I actually like who he is. It’s very surprising to me that he’s engaged in these behaviours by seeing how great he is now. I believe people can change, I turned my life around - went to school and I’m going back to be a child therapist but Im scared it’s too much of a risk. Can I trust him? He said most girls have left him in the past because of these things. Should I talk again with him? Should I end things?

">But he said he cheated because they pushed him away and tried to change him

🚨🚨🚨 Wee-oo wee-ooo, call the red flag brigade. He told you that it wasn't his fault he cheated. That is NOT a sign of a reformed cheater. It's a sign of someone who has never taken responsibility for *being a cheater*. The latter kind of person is a very high risk for repeat cheating.

I cheated once, on my first love. It's one of the bigger regrets I have in my life. I did it because I was horny and foolish. I was insecure, and a boy was nice to me, so I made out with him to boost my ego. This was an incredibly dumb move on my part, because I already had a boy who loved me to the moon and back... I just didn't value him enough. It took me years and years to forgive myself.

My cousin also cheated when she was young. We talked about it. Like me, she takes full responsibility: ""I cheated because I was unhappy, but I was too stubborn and unwise to leave the relationship directly. So I sabotaged it. Also I was horny.""

The horniness factor is always a thing, and cheaters should be able to own up to that. Like, we can control our libidos. We just chose not to.

The weird hard drugs thing reminds me of my extremely creepy uncle. He talks like that too, and thinks it's normal and funny. Meanwhile everyone else is vomiting inside their mouths. Said uncle wonders why he never gets invited to family parties, but will scream at anyone who dares challenge his grossness. Anyway...

I would never ever date someone like that. He cannot respect and love women if he has just used women for sex by providing drugs before.

"I’ve cheated and I absolutely never ever ever would tell a prospective partner that it was because my ex did x, y, z. I cheated because I was too cowardly to tell them I wasn’t ready for a real relationship, and because I was scared of hurting them by telling them I wanted to leave and those are very real flaws that I am working on before I date again. I would not trust that. He wants to blame the other person, instead of himself. He chose to cheat, and he hasn’t figured out that he should have ended things if he thought they were that incompatible.

"I’m from Canada and went down to a resort trip with some friends to Mexico.

On the last night I met this girl and we clicked off instantly, the catch was that her flight back to Alaska was in 10 hours and mine was in 3.

We went to the beach at night and it was just really romantic and the whole time both of us were regretting not talking to each other sooner. Ended the night with some fun back at her place and she told me I should hit her up if I’m ever in Alaska but we both knew it was a bit of a leap since after i said goodbye she said “I’ll probably never see you again…”

I don’t think she realizes how badly I wanted to stay 😅

I texted her during her trip saying thanks for a great last night and I’ll hit her up if im in Alaska. She sent back a photo of us saying we look cute together, I agreed and ever since I told her to have a safe flight it’s just been hard having a conversation.

Had she been in Canada I 100% would have tried making something out of this but the fact that she’s so far from me makes it impossible.

She’s traveling to Houston in October and I could meet her there but do I just stay quiet until that time then talk to her out of nowhere?

Or do I check up on her every so often? Would checking up too often be weird since we’re not even in a relationship?

I haven’t felt this kinda chemistry with someone in a while and it would definitely help me move forward if I knew the feeling was reciprocated. But I’m afraid of doing too much and scaring her off or doing too little and losing touch…

Since I sent the last message I thought I’d leave it up to her to initiate the conversation again but idk if that’s a good move

If you feel it’s right, go for it. Always trust your gut. Be careful though. I’ve learnt the hard way that what they say and do may not always align with what they truly want. Check up on her every now and then, if it’s always you initiating or she’s being dry, it wasn’t meant to be. Don’t fantasise over your chemistry during one night and leave yourself vulnerable.

"I'm a single dad and  I've been the one who's been raising ym daughter. My ex is to live a party lifestyle and she wants nothing to do with our daughter. My family has been treating me like shit. I've had a very traumatic childhood and when my parents were using drugs, I was also using because it's just what I learned from them (I was in middle school - high school then)

After I got with My ex I stopped and I have been sober since except for some thc here and there. My life just revolves around raising my girl and I don't mind it at all, but Mt family just seems to hate me. I've done everything for them and they don't seem to love me. 

I have a lot on my mind, I still think about the way my ex played me and chested on me and decided not to be a mother. I think about the things I had to go through as a child, I lost people very close to me recently, and I just don't think I can really take it anymore.

I'm just done and I am ready to throw in the towel. I just want to disappear and for everyone to move on with their life once I'm gone, but I don't think I could just leave my daughter. Whenever it's my time to go, I don't want my daughter to land in the hands of my ex, but I don't know what to do. I care about her so much and I just want the best for her. She deserves a whole loving family and not just a boring old father like me. What should I do moving forward or how could I give my daughter a better life before I go?

"

My bf (m22) and me (f21) have been in a relationship for 1 1/2 years and one issue that has been remaining ever since we first started dating, is that I find it difficult to see through negative situations when they happen.
I feel like I always have this brain fog in my head and when he tells me about something negative, something that bothers him or something I did wrong, it takes me a while to realise the actual issue he's trying to communicate.
It makes me feel like a horribly bad person to be so unaware and I've hurt him quite some times already by not realising things I'm doing.

I don't really know where this is coming from, but one thing I know is that I grew up in a very difficult environment/family situation. 
Issues and problems within my family were always sweeped under the carpet (still are) and I haven't learnt how to properly communicate until I was 20.
I'd bottle up my emotions and would lose control over them once the bottle was filled to the brim, which caused me to lash out at him many times because I didn't know how to appropriately communicate.
It's gotten better, but I've always found it hard to open up as I was getting yelled at and hit whenever I did, so eventually I stopped and had to re learn it.

Whenever my bf used to communicate with me what bothers him, I'd go into defensive mode and I think that has been a big problem.
I know he's not attacking me by telling me something he's not comfortable with, but in that exact moment, I feel like I have to defend myself.

I just don't know how to get rid off this behaviour and the brain fog.
I feel like I understand where he's coming from and what his problems are, but it takes me so long to do so and I struggle with grabbing the issue by the root - it's like an invisible wall I seem to not be able to break through. 

Do you guys have any advice on how to be more aware and what to do to about this problem?
I'm afraid I'm going to turn into a narcissist or something as I already feel like I'm being ignorant - and I really don't want to hurt anyone with it.
Would therapy be an option?
I've tried getting into it for many years, but unfortunately it never worked out as the waiting lists are very long.

I'd appreciate some advice that can open my eyes a little.

"Trauma therapy is needed here. The brain fog could be a bit of dissociation or something from the way you describe it. You're obviously safe, so that fog might be caused by events in your past. Healing those might help to clear your head. 

Otherwise, maybe try some yoga. It helps with being less reactive. It calms most people, but with trauma in the mix, I'll just say if you feel worse with it, then stop. 

Something else that might help is journalling about this exact issue like how you wrote it out here. How you feel, how he feels, what the situation is etc. That can be super helpful."	wonppili	reply	na	na	na	0.9963560104370117	no	no	no	na	relationships
"So I(16F) have been friends with this guy (16M) for a few months. We play video games together and just talk about our lives and stuff. The thing that bothers me is that he is very insecure. He always says he's ugly, he's stupid and just says bad things about him in general. I don't know how to respond to this and I feel more like a mother than friend having to reassure him absolutely everytime.

Whenever we talk and I ask how his day went he always said that he just sits in bed crying and when I ask why he says he doesn't want to talk about it. If he didn't want to talk about it why tell me in the first place? He basically always says that he's very weird and no one likes him and when I ask why he says that he refuses to elaborate saying that he just knows. He always apologizes for being annoying every single time even though I told him he doesn't have to.

I really want us to be friends but this is getting very annoying making him not really feel like a friend anymore. I was there for him and comforted him everytime but I've had enough. I don't know what to do because I don't want to hurt him or make him feel bad for this.

"We met about year ago, started chatting and went out couple of times. Everything went perfectly, we had fun and planned to go out again. I told her that I had feelings towards her and she told the same to me. All of a sudden she starts acting weird and arrogant towards me. Finally one day she told me that she never had any feelings towards me and she just wants to stay friends. I stayed calm but at the same time was surprised after all the things we did/shared together. I thanked her for the honesty and moved on with my life even though I was 'heart broken'.

6 months later, no contact, I saw her outside with one of her friends and she was very enthusiastic seeing me. We talked a little and went our ways. Again I was surprised by her reaction.

Few weeks ago I saw her again and now she is upset at me for no apparent reason. I removed myself from this situation and was confused again.

I was in a relationship with my previous girlfriend for 7 years. I am very new to this dating world and I am confused. Is such behavior normal? should I remove her from everywhere (social media etc) and avoid contact in the future or should I ask/talk to her about this?

tl;dr : She told me she just wants to stay friends, 9  months later we see again and now she's mad at me."	No-Shoulder-7047	post	17.462708083537525	male	White	0.9987201690673828	na	na	na	2	relationships

"Hey everyone, last week I posted about my ex finding out that he’s the father of my son. It was removed but the summary is that I (26f) have a son (4) with my ex (30m). I’ve known him for 15 years and dated him for 8. We had already broken up when I found out that I was pregnant. My ex was in prison at the time and was released a few weeks ago. When we broke up we had a huge fight and when I found out I was still pissed off at him and didn’t want to tell him. I visited him a handful of times but never brought it up. He also isn’t registered as the father.

Last week I ran into him while shopping with my son. We made some small talk and he asked how old my son is/his name etc. I told him without really thinking about it and we went our separate ways. Later that day he called me and asked me outright if he was the father. I told him he was and he wanted to know why I never told him. I just said that it didn’t matter because he was in prison for the last 5 years and my boyfriend was the one to support me through everything.

We agreed that he could come by to see my son if he calls and makes an appointment beforehand. He then showed up unannounced at our door at 9 p.m. with a stuffed teddy and some toy cars. He said he wanted to see his son and demanded that we let him in. I told him that my son was already in bed and to call before he shows up next time. He tried to force his way inside which ended in a fight between him and my boyfriend. He left after that.

I started dating my current boyfriend while I was and he loves my son like his own. He was in the process of adopting him but we agreed to put that on hold for the moment. He doesn’t like my ex and said he doesn’t want him to come over.


Now to this post: The day after all of this happened, my ex texted me to apologize. He said that he was shocked when he found out and in his head he just had to see him immediately. We agreed that he’d come by in the afternoon. I talked to my boyfriend and he said he’d be fine with giving him a second chance. 

My ex came by and we had a great afternoon. My son responded to him immediately and my ex was being very sweet with him. He stayed for around 4 hours and I don’t think I’ve ever seen him so happy before. When he left he asked if he could come over again the next day. He looked genuinely hurt when I said that since it’s my boyfriend’s only day off we already had plans. But we agreed that he’d come by on monday. My son was really happy when he showed up again.

Yesterday before leaving, he asked if he could come over a little earlier and pick up our son from kindergarten with me. I agreed and today we went there together. He came over a bit too early though so we ended up getting a coffee first. During that time we spent just talking about random stuff, I kind of realized that I really missed him. 

It feels weird to admit that now but our relationship has always been special. We lived in the same neighborhood and have known each other for 15 years. We dated for 8 and he was my first boyfriend. I love my boyfriend but our relationship is different. 

I don’t know how to explain it without coming off as a complete ass but I think I just really miss how well my ex and I work together. It’s like he knows me in a way no one else does. We’ve been through a lot together and I’m really glad that he’s back in my life now. I don’t think my feelings for him are romantic but I’m a little worried it might come off that way. I don’t want to hurt my boyfriend but I’m just really happy to have my best friend back in my life.

Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this? I would appreciate some insights because I really don't know how to deal with all of this right now. Should I maybe bring it up to him?

Tldr: my ex was released from prison and found out that he's the father of my son. He's now back in my life and being very sweet towards me and our son.

"Take a little pause to remind yourself that your ex isn’t being sweet to your son. He’s had *two* encounters, following a night where he showed up unannounced and tried to **force himself inside and didn’t leave until after a fight**.

To the rest … sure goes to show the power of selective memory that you’re here describing an ex boyfriend you broke up with half a decade ago before he was incarcerated as someone you’ve “always” had a special relationship with.

Maybe this could be the start of a better relationship. Just go into it based on how y’all are *now*, not on some mission to reclaim the best version of your past with him."	ThrowraAggressiveCat	reply	na	na	na	0.9862812161445618	no	strong	no	na	relationships
"TL:DR My ex-girlfriend and I first got together six years ago and from day one, we got on like two peas in a pod. Then after two and a half years together, she fell pregnant. We had spoken about kids before and we both wanted a family but not after just two years together. 

We spoke about it a lot, asked a few of our friends that already have kids and eventually decided to go for it. We also agreed that even if our relationship doesn't last, our child's wellbeing would always come first. Right before the lockdown in 2020, three weeks before the due date, we welcomed a perfect little girl and both of us were completely infatuated.

It was a big adjustment but our girl was an angel and we settled into parenthood rather quickly. Everything was going great at first but three months later, it all changed. I was working late when I got a text from my mother to tell my mum girlfriend dropped our daughter off with her while she ran some errands but four hours later, she hadn't returned and now she wasn't answering her phone. I called too but she didn't answer me either. I got out of work, collected my daughter and went home to find a note from my girlfriend. She said that she couldn't handle the stress of lockdown and the baby and she just needed some time to clear her head. She also said not to call and that we would talk soon but days turned to weeks with no contact from her or anyone else other than her sister who visited her niece often but never mentioned my girlfriend.

Fast forward three years and my ex-girlfriend is slowly starting to reach out again. It was slow at first, liking photos of our girl on Instagram and the odd comment but that was it until last week. She sent me a text saying that she had seen how well our daughter and I are doing and asking if we could meet up. I was reluctant but we agreed before our daughter was born that her wellbeing is what mattered the most so reluctantly, I agreed to meet for a coffee so she can see our girl but I'm having second thoughts. How do I forgive her for walking out on me and more importantly, on our daughter?"	SeanMc96	post	48.38900887535203	male	White	0.9780910015106201	na	na	na	29	relationships

Protect yourself and your daughter, legally and emotionally. Talks about meeting the little one can wait untill after that. She abandoned the girl for far too long, and this has implications in custody and in the way your daughter sees the world. She is young, and a heartbreak can be especially significant in these years, leading to trauma and sense of abbandonment.

Don't do that to yourself or your **child**, my man.  Instead, sue her for child support, and the BACK child support she hasn't been paying for the last 3 years, and be the calmest, least interesting, gray rock, co-parent you can be.

"Honestly, I wouldn’t let your daughter meet her at this stage. It’s been 3 years, you don’t know who she is anymore. You need go protect yourself legally before opening the door up to joint custody. 

If she wants a relationship, she will go through the court to get supervised visitation and a step up plan. She’ll pay child support. She’ll do things the right way to build a relationship with your child. 

She doesn’t get to just pop back in and be mom with full legal rights. You need to establish primary custody for yourself, based on 3 years of full time care. 

She abandoned her child and there is a legal procedure she can follow if she wants to be involved. 

Her reaction to your request that she do these things, will likely tell you how committed she is to actually being a mom. She’s walked away once when your daughter didn’t know her. The potential for heartbreak for your child is huge. It’s not about you or your ex. It’s about your kid.

Damn that's such a shitty situation to be in, you want what's best for your daughter and of course knowing who her mom is and having her mom in her life, if she's going to be stable and there for her, would be beneficial but hopefully you can separate yourself from the mom because she proved to you that you're not worth it to her and you deserve way better than that, I'm not sure if you'd want to forgive that behavior and allow that back in your life, I think you're going to have to find a balance of involving her but not getting yourself to involved where you get feelings cuz I'm sure there's a lot of unresolved emotions there, but you deserve someone who puts you higher on their list	SeanMc96	reply	na	na	na	0.9780910015106201	weak	no	no	na	relationships

I agree here, but for different reasons. Yes, you need to scope out the situation she is in first to ensure you are not pitting your daughter in a dangerous situation. But most importantly, you will need time without your daughter there. Your ex abandoned you and your daughter. She does remember her, but you do. I am willing to bet there are still some raw feelings there for you. You really don't want to run the risk of having a blow-up with your daughter there to witness it.

"My bf (31 M) and I (25 F) have been dating for 3 months and have only known each other for 4 months. I think he’s great but about a month ago I noticed he followed 2 accounts that both belonged to one girl. One is her gym account and the other is her main account. I told him I noticed this and that she likes many if not most of her posts. He said if it made me uncomfortable he didn’t have to. He told me she was just a friend of a friend that he casually sees at the gym. She is also about 20-21 which would make her 10 years younger than him. I don’t know if that is supposed to make me less or more uncomfortable with the situation. 

Fast forward to about two weeks ago, I was sitting next to him while we were out at a bar and while he was scrolling through his phone I noticed she had him on her close friends list. He clicked through her close friends (he was not trying to hide it from me) and it was all selfies and videos of her also being out at a bar. This caused me to kind of shut down and feel really weird. When he dropped me off at my house I brought it up and explained that it just made me uncomfortable. When we talked about it later once we had both sobered up, I explained that it doesn’t have anything to do with her and that I wasn’t even necessarily jealous, but it made me feel uncomfortable that he is on her close friends story. 

He has explained to me that he told her he had a girlfriend and apparently she was very excited and happy for him. To me it’s just strange because if they are not that close then why does he feel such a need to like her pictures and why does she have him on her close friends list. I’m actually not assuming anything but it does make me feel disrespected. 

This morning I had a weird intuition to check and she just posted some new pictures on her gym account where she looked great and I see he liked it. She just posted that 15 hours ago. 

I know I cannot control him or what he does/likes on instagram, but it hurts my feelings that I told him that it makes me uncomfortable and he continues to like her posts. I feel like that sends a signal to her and to anyone who sees it that he doesn’t value our relationship. Or maybe I am just projecting. I’m aware I’m hyper focused on this one girl and maybe he likes many girls pictures but for some reason this specific one keeps coming up. 

I am trying to react appropriately but don’t even know how to bring this up to him or what I can say to make him understand. I don’t want to seem crazy but I can’t help the fact that it makes me uncomfortable. I need some advice on how to bring this up and make it a productive conversation or if this is just a foreshadowing of what the rest of the relationship will become. How should I react to this or should I react at all? 

TLDR: My bf likes another girls pictures even after I told him it makes me uncomfortable. He’s also on her close friends story and follows her main and gym account"	Novainthesky	post	29.33467038504073	female	White	0.9971195459365845	na	na	na	3	relationships

"My girlfriend and I went to a music festival this past weekend and had a ton of fun! One of her favorite DJ’s was playing and so we shared an AirBnB with a group of 8 of my friends who my girlfriend kind of knows but got closer with over the course of the trip.

Right before her favorite DJ came on I noticed I was was having a hard time keeping my balance in the crowd. I had been drinking throughout the day and was on day 3 of the festival so I think it was a combination of exhaustion and the drinks. I was going to try and be tough but when I started to feel myself blacking out I knew I needed help or I was going to cause a scene. 

I told her what was happening and that I needed help and she got me out of the crowd (i’m ballparking the crowd was 750-1000 people). She saw I was in bad shape and knew my phone was broken so called me an Uber and came back with me to the AirBnB, so she missed the act she was most excited to see.

From there, I just passed out on the bed and was fine, but I’m feeling embarrassed at the fact that I needed to be taken care of. She texted my friends what happened and honestly handled it perfectly. I would hate to have ended up in the medical tent for drinking in a way that was well within my limits just a couple years ago. 

How do I repay her? She helped me so selflessly. Once we got home we talked about it at length and came to a place of connection. She really doesn’t want this to be a recurring thing. I was surprised this even happened because I am generally pretty good at handling my drinks, this just happened and I really needed help and she helped me in such a selfless way. I just feel like there’s something more I can do besides talking with her about it that will let her know strongly I felt and how much more in love with her I am after this.

TL;DR: I blacked out in a crowded place, and my girlfriend’s altruism meant she had to miss a really important concert. How do I repay her?"	Pissed_Achio	post	21.959722735741085	male	White	0.002274183090776205	na	na	na	5	relationships

"Can you get another set of tickets for this act?

But more generally, I think I'd reframe it a bit.  Helping you out like that is really what you should be doing for someone you're in a relationship with (or even a friend!), it's not something super exception.  Even if she hadn't, I doubt she would have been able to enjoy the show much - even from a purely selfish perspective, it's entirely possible her ""best move"" so to speak was to go with you.  What you should be doing is apologizing for letting it happen in the first place, i.e. not managing your limits better especially before an act she was excited for.  I think some concrete steps to do that, whatever that looks like (drinking less in general perhaps?), would go a long ways if I was in her shoes."

"Hi!  
  
I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some perspective on this situation. So, here's the deal: My bf broke up with me about 2 years ago, and it was a pretty rough breakup. We both went our separate ways, and I made the decision to block him on all social media platforms except Snapchat. It was my way of moving on and healing.  
  
However, here's the twist. Every three months like clockwork, he reaches out to me on Snapchat. Initially, I thought it was just a casual catch-up attempt, but this pattern has persisted for the past 2 years. I've been doing my best to ignore these messages and focus on my own life, especially since he's been in a new relationship and studying abroad for the same duration.  
  
Recently, he messaged me on Snapchat acknowledging that I've blocked him elsewhere and said he wants to talk or catch up. I'm honestly baffled by this behavior. Why would he keep trying to initiate conversations, especially after our not-so-amicable breakup? He's been in a relationship for 2 years now, and I assumed he would have moved on completely.  
  
I'm conflicted and a bit confused about his intentions. Could it be a genuine desire to mend things or clear the air after our breakup? Or is there something else going on that I'm not seeing? I'm hesitant to engage with him, as I've been working hard to move forward in my life. But part of me is also curious about what he might have to say.  
  
Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.  
  
TL;DR: Broke up with my ex-boyfriend 2 years ago after a rough breakup. He's been texting me every 3 months on Snapchat, despite me blocking him everywhere else. He's currently in a relationship and studying abroad.

"He's currently in a relationship and you're the ex. The right thing to do is block him and complete your journey of moving on.

Right. I just think it's kinda selfish that he pops up in my life every now and then, reminding me of him.

The thing is, you'll never get the answer you think you want, especially if he's doing this for selfish reasons.

"So my gf started a fight with me about how I changed and I don't ask her on dates anymore however when I previously did ask she just starts another fight and says we obviously won't see each other fighting, she then proceeded to ghost me, which I tried contacting her asking or calling, when none worked I simply initiated no contact, I did everything nice for her and I never plan to start arguments, she usually starts them for no reason and is almost all of the time moody. Now after the ghosting she added some guy who is a friend of a friend on Instagram and proceeded to accept a request from someone I know. I have no idea what to do as I am very confused, confused why I am ghosted after doing everything, I literally never planned to fight with her, she just started it and after I gave her valid arguments she just said can we not talk and said bye and hasn't showed up since, I don't know if I should remove her on social media or just continue avoiding her.

"I’ve been friends with Gary for 2-3 years and he’s been a wonderful guy until about 2 months ago.

 He’s been dating a girl for I believe almost 2 years and she’s incredibly nice for the most part, she used to be jealous of the friendship between me and Gary. 

She mutes everyone besides Gary in group calls, doesn’t ask to hang out or play games with anyone unless Gary wants her to ask.

 I’ve never truly felt like she and I were super close and that’s why my disagreement with Gary doesn’t make a lot of sense to me.

 I’ve played games with his girlfriend a handful of times, usually only when Gary is there but I have played with her just the two of us.

Gary’s girlfriend can be.. aggressive if you play different from how she wants you to. So when a game I’m not very good at became the focus for about a week I didn’t want to play it with her.  

 I tried to politely and delicately phrase it as she can be a bit.. bossy. Gary was NOT a fan to put it mildly. He stopped talking to me for a month, still talked to my boyfriend though. 

I’d like to mention also that Gary told his girlfriend what I said but phrased it as I’m done playing all games with her and it made her question herself and ask “what’s wrong with me?” While she cried talking to him. 

I was/am open to playing games with her. But nobody’s reached out to play anything following patching things up. 

 We patched things up a few weeks ago but things will never be the same. Gary has resulted to being much more aggressive about things he doesn’t like about me.   Namely my appearance of dyed hair and piercings. I always take out my nose ring for job interviews and ask about hair color/piercing policies.

 It may sound dumb or silly but my septum ring means a lot to me. I beat cancer at 16 and my mother and I got our noses pierced together to commemorate the cancer free status. 

Gary told me to throw my nose ring in a river and “you beat cancer, beat your attachment to a metal ring gollum.”   It hurt to read that. Far more than being called bossy in my opinion. Then he immediately tried to change the subject after.   I told my boyfriend I honestly don’t think Gary even wants to be friends with us.

 He doesn’t invite us to things or hangouts anymore.   Gary has also talked badly of me to my boyfriend and vise versa he’s talked badly of my boyfriend to me.  

 I think it’s time to wash my hands of this friendship. Gary did tell me I deeply offended him when I called his girlfriend bossy, and I can’t expect other people’s feelings to adhere to my timetable.

 I dunno, there’s a part of me that is still torn as Gary has helped me through tough times emotionally and financially. I feel like ending the friendship would make him feel used.  I just feel confused about if it’s even worth speaking about it or just ghosting.   Should I try to sit him down and have a conversation? Or is this friendship already D.O.A? 

Being friends with someone who would twist my words so harshly doesn’t sound like something I’d like but before this he treated me like “a little sister” 

TL;DR Called a friends gf bossy, friendship isn’t the same after 2 months. Friend is now more aggressively hurtful verbally towards me."	Throw_raMuffinLad	post	21.229475035601077	male	White	0.9728753566741943	na	na	na	5	relationships

"TL;DR

I am debating ending our relationship because I feel disrespected and like I can’t fully trust her. 


I recently started dating a girl. We met at university at the start of the academic year. We were friends for a while, then became closer and started dating. She says was interested from the beginning, but I wasn’t looking for anything at the time as I was focusing on my career. I should add that we are the same age, this would be my first relationship and her fourth. 

This summer we have been in the same city (she lives here and I will be working here for the year). We have been trying to see each other once a week but this hasn’t always been possible - I work long hours and she also has strict parents. Soon she will be going back to university, which is around 6h from where I’ll be staying. 

A couple times she’s missed times we’ve agreed to call due to family commitments or work. That’s fine, but what annoyed me is the lack of notice. She also had to cancel one date for similar reasons, but to be fair to her she did let me know in advance. 

Recently, she has been taking a long time to text back (almost 24h sometimes). I want to give her benefit of the doubt, as she is busy travelling with her family, but where would you draw the line? I’ve mentioned my frustration and she has acknowledged it and says it will be easier to call when she’s at university again. Right now I don’t feel as if I can trust her 100%. 

I am not desperate for a relationship at the moment, and I don’t want it to get in the way of my career. I have also been really working on myself for the last year or so and I know that I have options. 

At the same time I am hesitant about ending things so soon as I believe that we can work on these issues. We have great chemistry, and similar values and there’s a lot of things I enjoy about our relationship too.

"I understand the part where she has strict parents, not being able to call etc. But nobody in this world takes 24h to respond to a text. Everyone has their phones right in their hands and it takes hardly a minute to text back a person who you want to stay connected with.
As you have already mentioned your concerns to her, I guess getting replies earlier are out of question as you won't have written a post here if the situation would have improved. You can talk to her again about all this. I would suggest you to stop texting first and see if she even bothered with your sudden absence."

Okay we have the exact same story. So I completely understand. Just continue to live your day to day life and give the rest to God. If it's meant to be, it will. You never know, he may come back to you in a month or two or three or even a year down the line. If you really love him, just wait on him then. Don't jump into another relationship. You can continue to date without any sexual activity (just friendly dates) and see who you'll meet. In the meantime, continue to be a productive, active, kind, good person and leave it to God.

"I’m in a weird situation where I’ve been hooking up with a guy for about two months and it’s been going okay, except that he brought up a rather serious ex of his twice in the first week or two we were hooking up. The issue isn’t that he brought up his ex, but that he told me about their break up in depth (broke up a year ago, they were on/off for 3 years & she cheated), and after a night where he had a panic attack for an unrelated reason, he ended up taking Xanax to calm down and brought up that he changed his whole life for her and described her as “cool, hot, and funny” among other things. 

Obviously that whole night became a huge deal breaker for me and I was planning on ending it the next time we talked, but when I brought it up he began apologizing and said he had no idea where that came from, that he doesn’t feel that way about her, etc. 

We had already been sleeping together by this point, and the sex was good enough for me to decide I would just continue this as a hookup, since I figured there’s no way I could catch feelings for someone who’s willing to look me in the face and talk about how hot his ex is while also sleeping with me. 

If you can see where this is going, it’s probably not a surprise that I’m here. Because fast forward another 6 weeks and we clearly have feelings for each other. He’s told me he wants an exclusive relationship, and while I do like him and we’re compatible in a ton of ways, the first two weeks of hooking up are still a rough spot for me. Part of me thinks there’s no way I can respect myself if I date someone who acts like that much of a red flag, but he’s been a sweet, attentive, and kind, and his ex hasn’t come up again since. 

I’m extremely attracted to him, the sex is great, we have similar humor, and have hung out and gone on dates probably 3-4 days a week since meeting without getting tired of each other. If the ex thing hadn’t happened I would seriously be considering entering a relationship with him, but as it stands right now, the idea makes me equally happy & nauseous, and I don’t know if I’m being overly picky or if this is something reasonable to end a potential relationship over. 

I’d normally go to my friends with this, but I recently moved across the country for family so it’s hard to find time to catch up and ask for advice on stupid boy drama.

"TL;DR: My friend (24M) overwhelms me (23M) with detailed info about his life. I feel uncomfortable about this (specially when he talks me about family travels or his home) because his sister (22F) was a toxic ""friend"" of mine in the past, and I want to keep zero-contact with her and not know anything (directly of indirectly) about where she travels or how her house is evolving.


I've been friends with this guy for several years now. I met him because her sister (then 16F, now 22F) (which I was friends with) introduced us to each other. My friendship with that girl eventually came to an end due to her becoming a toxic person, but I remained my friendship with her brother, and as of today we are still friends. 

However, our friendship is quite peculiar.

Apart from me, he doesn't have any other close friends. He uses to spend his free time inside his house, isolated in his bedroom doing stuff on his PC. He only goes out from his house when he has to go to work or some errand commanded by his parents. I've tried several times to hang out with him, but he simply doesn't want to. So the only option we have is to meet at his house, but that would imply seeing his sister, who I wanted to keep away from me in a zero-contact-ever way, due to the psychological traumas she caused me.

So, despite living only 300 m apart from each other, we have something similar a to long distance friendship. Our conversations are fully message-based since the moment I established zero-contact with his sister.

At first, I was fine with that. We found out some ways to enjoy ourselves, even with the given limitations.

However, I don't feel that way anymore.

I've developed a lot of anxiety due to other things that happened in my life. Since then I got overwhelmed by how my friend info-dumps his life to me. In the past I didn't care much about that, but now I feel like I'm just his personal daily journal.

While I don't tell him too many superfluous details of my life, and I don't like to talk to him everyday (just from time to time), he even logs small but unimportant details, such as the road milestone numbers when he travels on holidays with his family, the exact details of the places he needs to go to, all the stuff he has to do, all the details of the game he is playing, or even some ""unnecessary information"" about him being in the toilet doing stuff that are intended to do there.

I have tried muting his notifications, but I'm still being able to see them. Blocking him is something I've thought about, but maybe it's too drastic.

There are some extra things to consider:
* I highly suspect he could be on the autism spectrum. Actually, I'm autistic and have my diagnosis as ASD level 1, and info-dumping is something that often happens to us when we talk about our special interests. However from what I know, his parents rejected him (and his sister) to be psychologically examined for possible neurodivergencies. Since I'm not a professional psychologist I can't determine this in a exact way.
* While I sometimes info-dump my friends/family/gf about my passions, that isn't on a daily-basis, but what overwhelms me is, he does that every other day, if not everyday.
* One of his high dosis of info comes from his house and his travels, and then I feel extra unconfortable, because that indirectly gives me too much info about people I don't want to know anything about (mainly his sister and her respective bf [23M]). I feel an irrational fear of talking with my friend about this, because of those people and that they can take part on this situation, looking for inflict me the most psychological damage possible as they did some years ago, because of my atypical behaviours as an autistic.

So, anyone could give me advice on this?"	manu_romerom_411	post	23.76878165743815	male	White	0.9981970191001892	na	na	na	2	relationships

If this is a polite/professional type of friendship then politely say:

""Don't you think that's sharing too much personal information?""

The point is: You have to tell him that you are not comfortable with the info-dump."	manu_romerom_411	reply	na	na	na	0.9981970191001892	no	strong	no	na	relationships

yesterday night i couldnt even sleep properly and kept having nightmares and waking up from them, i dont have any appetite today and i've been crying since the morning. i've never reacted this way before to anything hell even when my mom disowned me i didnt react this way. i just have no idea what to do with myself anymore and i feel this sense of excrutiating emptiness and boredom. 

i feel like i hit a new low and tomorrow im going out on a boat trip with my irl friends and i dont wanna be in a terrible mood and be tearing up the whole time..

"Hi! I'm looking for advice on how to deal with this situation.  
  
My high school group of friends is kinda toxic: they're always trying to diminish or get each other down with small insults. To be fair, it's mostly one of them who behave this way and lately he's been focusing on me. Since I started going to Uni I have been hanging out with my high school friends less often, because my new uni friends are way nicer. Sadly, since we live quite far from each other, it's hard for us to hang out regularly (we go out like twice a month). For this reason I still hang out with my high school friends, but honestly I'm getting tired of their behaviour. I've never talked to them about how I feel about this, plus they blamed me for spending more time with my new friends than with them.  
  
I was wondering if I should cut them off, since most of the time we hang out I get home angry at them. On the other hand I've noticed it's not easy to make new friends (I'm not extremely outgoing, but I have no problem talking to new people) beacuse where I live there aren't much places to meet new people and this is keeping me from cutting them off, because I wouldn't have other people to hang out with regularly.  
  
In your opinion is it worth to try to confront them about their behaviour?  
  
Thanks in advance! And sorry for my English, I'm not a native.

"I was in a similar boat when I went off to university. 

Yes, I think you will eventually cut your high school friends out of your life. Just a matter of How and When. 

What I did:

1. I did not make an effort to hang out with my friends.
2. I tried to find activities to fill my time so much that I was ""unavailable"" to hang out with my friends. (team sports, study, part-time job, volunteering... etc.)
3. I did not announce to the world ""I am cutting you out of my life. Bye!"".

Eventually, my high school friends just stopped asking me to hang out because they knew it would be futile. You may get some push-back but stay your course."	ImpressiveSilver3123	reply	na	na	na	0.9970762729644775	no	strong	no	na	relationships
"My husband (26M) and I (25F) have been married 8 months together for about 3 years and he's a great guy with most of the qualities I was looking for wich is why I said yes to marrying him. 

That being said, I've never felt a spark of passion or intense emotion with him like I did with other romantic relationships when I was younger (18). I wonder if everyone experiences this or if it's actually how it seems, like if I only felt things strongly because I was younger and hormones or whatnot changes as you mature.

I also struggle with my mental health in context of depression and anxiety so not sure if that's a factor at play either. We've never had strong physical intimacy or a passionate emotional connection through, but other aspects of our relationship are great. At the end of the day I guess I have to decide how important that is to me personally, I just want to see if anyone else has experienced the same or similar. Any advice I appreciated.

Normally I don't go to reddit for advice because a lot of the times the replies can be very extreme (ex. ""break up with them!""). But rn I just need some advice ASAP

I just started dating this guy almost 2 months ago. Things are going extremely well, and honestly I've already caught hella feelings for him. He's really caring, kind, sweet, just the whole package. Anyway, yesterday I ended having to go to the hospital and it turns out I had an incomplete miscarriage (not everything came out). I had previously had one a few weeks before I met him. (The story was, I was being stupid and not being a ""good girl scout"" as my dad likes to put it. I hooked up with a guy and low and behold I was pregnant. No idea until the miscarriage happened.) My boyfriend was the one who drove me to the hospital and of course wants to know what happened and what the doctors told me. I'm waiting to talk to him in person today cause that's a whole heavy conversation. I'm just debating on whether or not I should tell him right now. My mom says I don't need to and it's something I can wait until I'm ready to talk about, but my dad says that he should know.

At this point I feel like maybe I need to stop trying to date someone who doesn’t live in my city? Although for whatever reason, I feel like all the men I really hit it off with live elsewhere, and haven’t had any dates I was excited about in my city recently. What’s going on here?

Sometimes people do like the idea of dating long distance, you get to have some personal time while also being able to get excited about seeing a person after a long time. Maybe the idea of having someone around you all the time isn't your thing, or maybe the allure of dating someone from out of town is your thing. There's nothing wrong with that!

You may need to be more upfront with the people you date, making it clear that you are willing to date long distance and if they're not to keep looking elsewhere.

TLDR: My boyfriend (18M) who I’ve (18F) been dating for 7 months won’t stand up to his racist and disrespectful friends who continuously cause issues in our relationship, because he claims it’s normal in friend groups and doesn’t want them to be upset at him, what should I do?

My boyfriend's friends have made me uncomfortable and disgusted our whole relationship by making cheating jokes, saying racist slurs (they're all white) and sexual jokes about me. 
He has two friends who regularly say the N word, joke about cheating and touch him inappropriately. He has three other friends who degrade me by calling me *bfs name*'s ch1ck, *bfs name*'s b1tch etc (they all know my name). They say the N word anytime they can and act like it's the funniest thing out there.
They regularly make sexual jokes and references to each other such as asking one another to strip, ""pop a ti*tty"" or joking about r@pe/m0l*sting one another. I came into my boyfriends room earlier after bringing him some comfort stuff for his throat.
His friend who was on a discord video call told me to pop a t**tty while smirking and then said ""are we playing phasmo or is she giving you he@d?"". He ended the call and when I got upset about it he claimed that was ""just how he talks"" he says he doesn't like what his friends say but refuses to stand up to them or even stand up for me. I told him that it makes me really uncomfortable and that staying friends with these people while they act like that is almost as bad as doing it yourself, he dismissed it saying he was desensitized to it and he doesn't want to say anything because they would be upset at him. I don't know what to do anymore, I love him and I know he would never act like that himself but the fact that he won't stand up to it is making me question what kind of person he is."

**Wake up!** Love is not asking someone to care about you, *no one who loved you would ever allow the racism or sexual harassment you’re experiencing.* 

Love is about respect. And he does not show any care, love, or respect for you. **More than that, you need to show more care, love, and respect for yourself.

Recommendations:

1. Talk to him heart-to-heart about your discomfort and tell him to stop. If he does not stop, you walk away from him. (For this option, you really have to completely open yourself up to him and tell him how upset you are about it)
2. Pry him away from his friends, and introduce him to a ""higher-class"" of friends.

"This happened to me when I was 20. His friends kept making fun of me and he kept brushing it off. Then he started making fun of me publically and in front of them. Full on howls of laughter in a bar over something tiny and all his friends would laugh. The public affection stopped and he was only kind when they weren't around. 

Eventually about 3 months later he dumped me but kept using me for sex. Until the last time we had sex, he got up and started laughing, put on his clothes and walked out. I never saw him again. 

Years later, I found out, that one of his friends, the one that started the making fun of me, was secretly in love with me and made fun of me to mask it. He and that guy are no longer friends.

"Im mid-30s now and recently went back to my childhood home/town and realized that I no longer fit into my family.  Growing up, I was always a bit different, but on my last trip home it became very apparent that I'm severely different.  My family is extremely untidy, whereas I like my things and house neat, clean and tidy.  
My mom continuously only talks/gossips about other people.  She is not interested in my hobbies too much, she doesn't understand my job, so is never interested in that at all. 
On the last trip home I kept quiet and afterwards my sibling flew into me about how he cannot have a relationship with me if I don't speak to them.  But I sit in all the conversations and listen to all their nonsense talk, yet no one asks about my life or show any interest in me. 

So my question is, how do/did you deal with a similar situation?  Is it okay to just realise you are so different and move on with your own life?

I completely understand you and have been in your position. I come from an extremely dysfunctional family where my brother was the golden child and I had to follow in his footsteps. I grew up always feeling like like I wasn’t enough and that i had to be someone I’m not. There was a lot of gaslighting and emotional manipulation when I would speak to them about it. You know what I did? I said fk it. I learnt to love myself and who I was. Family isn’t bound by blood. Relationships mean so much more. I did things I loved even though my family would hate me for it. So what? It’s for me and me only. I got tattoos, dropped out of college and started my own business.

What I can say as someone who, when I met my husband I told him straight up that if he wants to be with me, he needs to want to travel and live abroad as those are ambitions I will not budge on. 

Now 14 years later we have spent years travelling, backpacking and having adventures. Soon we are fully emigrating to Czechia or Germany and are very happy. 

If you want stability - a home, a car, children and all that life script stuff while he wants to see the world, this is such a major incompatibility that would make me doubt the future of the relationship.

Sounds like you suffer from low-self esteem. You instantly put people on a pedestal and so you are then beneath them. You wouldn't obsesses over something you thought was not worth it. So you have a habit of placing extreme high value on people. Not good. Work on improving your self-esteem. Recognize that everyone is just human. And never ever put anybody on a pedestal. That takes time and self-work. Nothing good comes out of obsessing over anybody. I did that once and I was left cheated on and discarded. Only God is deserving of our worship.

"I(26M) love my girlfriend(24F) so much.. shes caring, loving, respectful, beautiful, etc.. butttt when she is stressed she is a completely different person. She has a big obligation coming up and Ik she’s overwhelmed ab it so I always try to be there for her and understand what she’s going through. I’m talking very moody, non talkative, non affectionate, etc. She also fears that when she’s in these moods that it will eventually push me away so she acts very defensive and puts a hard shell on. 

We have been tg for 10 months and Ik I’m her first real relationship. She is my second so I am more experienced. I love this girl with everything and I want to help but sometimes I just don’t know how. She always tells me that when she’s like this it doesn’t mean she’s losing feelings, nor wants to break up. It just means she’s overwhelmed. 

I understand it’s completely normal to get stressed and act different but when she gets like this its for a longer duration then normal. For instance I get stressed usually for a few hours maybe a day and I’m back to norm. With her its 2-3 days maybe a week where I’m getting cold behavior. I will love and support her through it all and I just want to help.

"I’ve been married for 16 years. My wife doesn’t handle stress well either and she’s in her 40’s. I tried to be the doting husband and boyfriend early on in our relationship. I would want to wait on her and try to cater to her every need and want to give her as much calm as possible. It only seemed to make it worse for us both. It took me a while to realize what she needed in those moments was space. Not just from me but from everything. I learned this by talking to her about it when she wasn’t stressed. When those times come up, I handle as much of our responsibilities as I can (we have kids and a home) and I check in once in the morning and once in the evening, otherwise she initiates any contact we have during those times (we are still sleeping in the same bed, etc.). Her obligations to me were that she limits that behavior to times when it is necessary (it happens for a few days three to five times a year) and when it’s over, we carve out a weekend getaway or a date night to reconnect as soon as possible. We have also agreed that if the she can’t de-stress after two weeks, she has to make an appointment with a therapist. It’s never come to that and this routine has worked great for us for twelve years. 

You need to talk to her when she isn’t in that mode. Hear her out and try to understand where it comes from and what she needs during those times. Let her know that you understand and are there for her but be there for her in the way that she needs you to be there for her. Don’t make it about you and want you want to do for her. It’s good to set boundaries for that support so she can’t have an excuse to walk all over you but in my experience, if she really loves and cares for you, those boundaries never get pushed."

"It seems like she knows she’s that way, which is a good first step. My wife is pretty conflict avoidant and hates admitting she’s wrong, so it wasn’t easy for her to admit she was letting it get to her. We were arguing about it and I just said “what do you need from me to help you” and she just said “space”. I was trying to do the things that I normally do for her to show her I care and I love her to try and make her feel better. She told me she loves those things most of the time but when she is stressed, she doesn’t have the emotional capacity to give and she feels guilty because she knows I am trying but she’s so stressed she’s got nothing for me. It was actually making her feel worse. So I told her I would keep us moving along while she is stressed and give her the space she needs. It was tough the first few times. Her telling me she had nothing for me hurt a little but I saw how she appreciated my gesture and it helped. Over time I realized that comment and her attitude in those moments had nothing to do with me. The date night/weekend getaway was actually her suggestion after a while because she noticed she was starting to bounce back from those times a little bit better than I was. She thought it was a good way to reconnect and recharge. It also helped me because it gives me something to look forward too in the moment. 

My wife is not your girlfriend so I can’t say what works for us will work for you. I also won’t tell you I am fine with her stress either. I’d rather her not be so consumed by it. What I can say is that you need to talk to her about it when she isn’t stressed and come up with a plan for when she is. Tell her that you will help her anyway that you can. I am not telling you to lose yourself or compromise your integrity for it, but be willing to be uncomfortable for her. I would suggest setting some boundaries too. The check-ins were important for me. I told her I wasn’t comfortable not hearing from her at all unless she initiated it. Putting a limit on it is important too. It’s understandable to me she can be like that at certain times but being like that all the time would be unacceptable. 

If she loves you and is a genuine person, it will make your relationship better in the long run. I feel like my wife is less stressed in the moment now than she was because she knows I am okay and we are okay."	Mrhonestquestions	reply	na	na	na	0.020907219499349594	no	strong	no	na	relationships
Yea I would say my girlfriend is identical. From the guilty part to the texting part. When she is having a busy day at work or stressed day I’m talking 3 texts a day max and if I don’t message first chances are I’m not hearing from her until she’s ready. Does it bother me yes but I am getting more comfortable with the no texting and not hearing from each other during these moments. she tells me it doesn’t change the way she feels about me and it’s just her needing her personal space. Is she cold during those moments yes and does it affect me ofc I do need to find a coping mechanism bc i have to accept her for who she is but I also want to be able to assist her	Mrhonestquestions	follow-up	na	na	na	0.020907219499349594	no	strong	no	na	relationships
"If it’s just a busy day that gets her, that might be a bit much for me. My wife might be a little shorter or less patient with me on those type of days (we all can be that way) but the emotional shut down stress is most often related to more stressful things than a tough day.  Big projects or presentations for work. Once a year she has to go in front of the board and make a big presentation and it always happens in the week leading up to that. It’s a once every couple of months deal. If it happened more often than that, I’m not sure I would handle that well. 

I also don’t think you should analyze the frequency of texts. There are days where I text my wife all day and there are days we don’t really text at all. It just depends on a lot of different things. That’s probably a product of living together too though. I know I’m going to see her and talk to her when I get home. Maybe you should suggest scheduling a time to talk each day. This will take the pressure and guilt off her having to remember if her mind is elsewhere but you will get the communication you need. At first I didn’t think my wife would appreciate those check ins when she is going but I think they matter to her as much as me. She has a few minutes to hear about the kids and my day and it makes her comfortable that everyone is doing okay. I always tell her that we are good in those check-ins (I’m being honest, she’s never over-stepped in all these years). I know she is stressed and while I don’t love the way she chooses to manage that stress, I’ve accepted it, and as long as she doesn’t overstep the boundaries we have set, we are good.

"My girlfriend has been pressuring and wanting me to move in with her since about the half year mark into our relationship. She is a lone student her and rents a basement. She says she is lonely and really wants to live with me because she loves me a lot. Also she says she needs to live at least 1-2 years with someone to fully understand them before thinking of marriage. 

While I fully love her and really do want to live with her, mythinking has been about finances. I have been working hard and saving for a couple years now by living with my parents to save up for a downpayment for a house. It has been my goal for quite a few years to save for a house and to move out straight to it once marriage is on the horizon. In my city in Canada, the house prices have more than doubled and it's really hard to be able to buy a place. I am really greatful that I am able to save up a good size downpayment (about $300k) and that owning a home is attainable. So many are struggling just to find a place to rent nevermind the obsurd rent Prices nowadays. So I am really apprehensive against renting. 

Further than this key issue, money has been a difference in our relationship. She likes to spend frivolously and lives almost paycheck to paycheck. She has just landed her first job out of college and she is wanting to go back to school down the line. She doesn't have any concrete plans for what she wants to study or fund it. I get the feeling she wants me to support her in that regards which is a concern. 

I on the other hand prefer to spend with a plan. I'm happy to splurge once in a while but usually default to saving up. Things are expensive nowadays and being financially stable is a top priority for me. 

I have been missing her like crazy, I literally wake up in the middle of the night with thoughts about her and her well-being. I have dropped 15 pounds and lost all appetite. Work and life has become a blur for me and I do believe I am in depression territory now.

6 months in she was looking to move in.  You're still pretty much strangers at a year out much less the previous 6 month demand.

Snap out of it.  Get some exercice, so something as simply walking.  Walking is considered as moving meditation.

Start picking up some new hobbies and realize that she was looking to better her living conditions and it had nothing to do with your relationship not moving forward.

She sounds a bit of a gold digger.

Be thankfull for the good times, and grieve the person that  you thought she was.  If she was as interested and in love with you, she would have given you space to feel comfortable about moving in together.

Eh I cannot judge because I basically moved in after 6 months. Once I stopped having on call shifts I just stopped spending nights at home. But then my partner asked if I wanted to rent a place with her 3 months in and we talked about it and had a plan to move in about 12 months after we started dating and like. Those 6 months basically living together showed we worked together in a cohabiting way. I can see why your gf wanted to move in with you and I can see why you didn't. The main thing is whether anything will change if you try and rekindle the relationship. Have you changed your mind? If not in the nicest possible way don't waste her time trying to renew a relationship where you are not able to give her what she wants. Also differing approaches to finances can work (me and my partner are different, I'm more like your gf and my partner is more like you) as long as you work with each other and compromise and you feel that you can trust her financially.

"She has working papers so the matter of residency probably has no bearing on whether or not she is in a relationship with you.

You mentioned that you were able to save $300K (which is an incredible amount of money) and you are only 28 , infers that even living  at home with your parents, you make a high salary.

It seems that once she keyed into your salary, she pushed for moving in together.  You also noted that her living paycheck to paycheck was not her just paying bills but frivolous spending.  In addition, you mentioned that she wanted to go back to school with you funding her lifestyle.  All these together suggests that she is trying to sponge off of your money and not wanting to get to know you, the person, better.

The urgency for the move also adds to the picture.

That you are so upset and not dealing with the breakup well, suggests to me that she figured that she had you wrapped around her little finger but you surprised her by saying 'No' to the move in.  She further upped the ante and broke up with you.

>  ... she needs to live at least 1-2 years with someone to fully understand them before thinking of marriage. 

She made that remark as her reasoning for a too soon to move in date.  I get the feeling that you don't connect often and she picked up on that and threw the 'marriage' idea out there.  It's fine to have this opinion when sharing values and goals for the future.  Yet, she used this reasoning at the 6-month mark as a reasonable request to co-habitate, to a person that she doesn't know from Adam; sketchy.

By even thinking about trying to rekindle the relationship plays into her mind games.  She is dangerous for your well being in terms of mentally, emotionally and financially.

You have already listed several manners of ways that you are incompatible for the long-term.  Given that her actions are self-serving, be glad the metaphorical trash took itself out.  Leave the trash on the curb.

Grieve the person that you had hoped she was, learn the lessons that you can from this relationship and go forth with a better idea of what type of woman that you want to get to know better who has the potential to be your long term mate.

For example, now you know that you want a fiscally responsible mate, a planner, a person that can stand by themselves, etc.  

Maybe make a list of desirable characteristics that you want and what are deal breakers.  This way when you date for a purpose, you will know sooner than later whether a future date is worth pursuing further.

So snap out of it as much as possible, work out to expend some energy, and thank your lucky stars that you dodged a bullet.

I was supposed to come over at 7:30PM. Anyway, I work as a web developer for a marketing agency, and my boss hit me with a huge major task that was urgent and it was so last minute. 

I texted her at 7PM profusely apologizing, told her I got hit with work, and can come over later tonight or earlier or anytime tomorrow. 

She replied an hour later saying tomorrow would be better than later tonight as she is tired from yoga tonight. And not to worry and she isn't mad. I asked her what time would work for her tomorrow, and I told her I had a little bit of work but will be done at 11AM because I'll be done with all my tasks by then. 

It' now 10:20 the next day, so over 12 hours, and still no reply.

"I met a guy who so far is great. He is very reliable and communicative, funny, good looking, honest and seems to care. We met a month ago online and went on 2 dates. Then we decided to spend the past 3 days together out of town. We had a great time from the get go and last night we had a deeper conversation about our childhoods, family relationships and past relationships. He asked me about my last relationship and how that felt/why it ended and naturally I returned the question. Now here is where I wonder if I should take the following as a red flag/dealbreaker - I will quote him: 

“Last years relationship lasted until about mid of the year, so from end of 2021 to mid 2022. It was very serious, very intense and felt like someone I could spent the rest of my life with. But eventually we weren’t compatible and there were things that I just knew wouldnt work further down the line, so I ended it and I know in my heart that it was the right decision. She is still a best friend and someone who I’m very attached to. (🙄🙄🙄🙄) The relationship before that lasted 3 years and we were talking about starting a family, getting a house, building a life and everything but ultimately it didn’t feel right and I ended it. But that is something that I had doubts about for a while after and she is someone that I still think about. And even though in both cases I know in my heart I did the right thing it is still a difficult thing to go through, and I was asking myself “Why am I still thinking about her (3 year relationship) when I’m with this new girl (from last year)? Oh well, life is complicated but one thing that I will never do is settle. I think getting it right is more important than getting it”
So yeah, when I heard that I was concerned by a) the “we’re best friends and very attached” line and b) the fact that he still seems to think about the long  term relationship that he ditched in a way that it seems like he hasnt fully moved on?
I would rather avoid any ex drama and I also hate to think someone is laying next to me wishing I was someone else - so I wanted to check with people who have more experience if I am overreacting or if it is justified that my alarm bells went off?

Being friends isn't an issue so much as how quickly he gets attached, sees a future, and then they arentt compatible and he moves on.	TTMI2	reply	na	na	na	0.0014527078019455075	no	no	no	na	relationships
"Still being attached is a concern. Is it a thing where he talks to them all the time? How or why he ends up thinking about previous relationships would matter. Also how long he gives himself before dating again.

He could be doing the thing where he remembers good times from the past but doesn't actually miss the ex. That or overthinking about mistakes. Voicing that out loud on a date is a bit much though.

It is kind of a guess as you can't read his mind and he could be confused himself. If he actually isn't over past relationships it is a red flag and he shouldn't be trying to date yet.

I didnt inquire about how often they talk but from him saying “she’s still a best friend” I assumed so. The whole conversation as I quoted it lasted for about a minute and he never mentioned it before nor after, so it definitely didnt feel like he was talking about them too much or sharing it inappropriately, but the content of what he said is what bothers me I guess haha.

"Some context.... i am a 23 year old female and he is a 24 year old male. We've been a couple for 2.5 years and had moved fast in our relationship during the first year. That's not to say I was reciprocative, initially I has some reservations. As of late I've started to feel like his priorities regarding me are a bit left field.

I had come out of a season of singleness; one brought on by a stalker that had been a big source of stress for me. I was hesitant of getting myself into that situation again, plus we were long distance - I had sworn off long distance after going on dates with guys who never put in the effort to make the trip to see me, it was always me seeing them.

So when we had gone on our first date and he committed himself to making the trip 3 hours to see me once a week without prompting, I had been flattered and blown away. But had feelings that it might be too good to be true.

We moved forward rapidly, him admitting he was in live with me 3 months or so into our relationship. Him buying the ring and us planning our next steps. The biggest thing we wanted was for him to finish college before we married.

Tragedy struck for me a year in, my family disowned me, I lost my roof over my head and I was working desperately for what money I had to rent a temporary room for the next month. I then made the decision to move in with him.

From there I've gotten sick, lost my job, got better but soon fell into more debt due to medical bills and loss of income. I made changes took on another job and then lost my ability to walk after starting a job that was supposed to be my saving grace. 

For the past 1.5 years since moving in he's been.... aloof. He used to look at me with such love and admiration. We used to stay up and talk and enjoy eachothers company. Now he's either at work or on the computer till 5 am with his friends. 

He had always said that he wasn't so attentive because his classes were stressing him out. But since he graduated in May there's been no change. We haven't even talked about next steps in regards to the ring since then.

If I want sex he says no. If I want to watch a movie he says he's too tired. If I want to go out and just enjoy a day in town with him he says he doesn't feel well and wants to rest at home.

Since I moved in birthdays really aren't anything special, no Christmas celebration, no fun fourth of July, and certainly no valentine's day love. I even reminded him about our anniversary and he promised wed go out for dinner and then we didnt.

I grew up with a father that brought me and my sister flowers for everything. So when I didn't really get much this year it made me really miss my dad. 

He was such an amazing guy that pampered me within that first year and now it's like he's forgotten me even though I'm right by his side now.

I know he isn't cheating, I don't believe that he would because he hates guys that do that to their girl. Plus he insisted I have access to his location 24/7. But something is amiss and I really can't get him to open up to me.

I miss him so much and yet he's physically closer than ever... I feel overly dramatic in assuming love has been lost, but when he constantly turns me down and spends time doing anything and everything without me it starts to really hurt.

What should I do? He asks if there's anything he needs to change but when I politely bring up my hurt he doesn't seem to make much change. Am I dramatic or are my feelings justified?


TLDR; SINCE I MOVED IN HES BEEN DISTANT THE PAST 1.5Y AND HAS SEEMINGLY PUT ME LAST IN HIS PRIORITIES. TOO TIRED FOR A MOVIE, NEVER IN THE MOOD FOR SEX, DOESNT WANT TO GO OUT WITH ME. HOLIDAYS/BIRTHDAYS/ANNIVERSARIES ARE SEEMINGLY FORGOTTEN AND IM AT A LOSS FOR WHAT TO DO, THINK, OR FEEL MOVING FORWARD."

"TLDR: Husband refuses to consider every solution I offer to any problem we face without contributing his own solutions or opinions.


Honestly I just need to vent, but if anyone has helpful advice I’m open to it. 
My husband and I have been together for a long time and for the most part we have a healthy relationship. He is a good person all around. 


Our biggest issue is how we handle stress and problem solving. I can work well under pressure and find solutions, even if it means adapting to situations that aren’t always convenient. My husband on the other hand, cannot handle stress at all and will shoot down any solution to any problem. I’m going to use a fake scenario here to better explain what I mean…


Let’s say we’ve opened up a lemonade stand. We have plenty of lemons, water and sugar to run said lemonade stand. Until one day, there is a temporary shortage of lemons and we need to figure out how to stay in business. The discussion goes like this,


Him: I don’t know what we’re going to do, we just have to shut down at this point.


Me: what if we buy instant lemonade mix and use that until we can buy more lemons?


Him: Ugh no that wont work.


Me: why not? We could also purchase already made lemonade from the store.


Him: Ugh no that won’t work either. There’s nothing we can do, we’re doomed and just have to close shop.


Me: We could temporarily serve fresh squeezed orange juice until we find a source for lemons?


Him: No we cant do that. Real lemons are the only option. Ugh this sucks, I wish there was something we could do.


Obviously this can be frustrating when trying to handle real adult issues. It seems like no matter how many solutions I offer, he shoots them down without providing any ideas of his own or even giving me his opinion on why he disagrees with my suggestions. He has this “Nothing can be resolved ever” mindset that drives me insane."	throwawayayayay2252	post	26.66606127635296	female	White	0.9994276165962219	na	na	na	7	relationships

As far as advice, I guess it depends on where your line in the sand is. Are you willing to drag him to therapy? Use an ultimatum to get him there?

"So I met this guy on grindr, and we joked a little and then talked about our interests, he does a lot of cool things and I told him about how I was writing a book. We both love nature and camping. He immediatley asked me out on a date but I delayed it a little. 

We switched to Instagram and we talked a little bit more. I'm going to be moving cities soon so I told him that in case that was an issue but he was fine with it as he can drive and its only an hours difference.

He flirted a lot, saying how he wants to cuddle me and stuff which I liked but made me nervous, I just struggle with flirting and receiving flirting. Yesterday I said that I'd also love to go on a date, and we are now gonna go on a date on Saturday.

I felt like I should make the plans as he was the one making most of the decisions prior so I wanted to be more balanced, so I suggested getting drinks at town and then seeing what happens afterwards.

I'm so nervous about this. This is the first time I'm going on a date ever, and it's the first time I'm going to be going on a date with a guy. I just don't know what to expect from dating. Plus I feel like the conversation is maybe a bit slow? We always say stuff like how are you and surface level things like that. But maybe that's normal? Maybe it's best to save better conversations for the date? I also feel like my choice of date mightve been stupid as I've never really drank in a bar myself yet. He seems to have more experience dating/nightlife than I do, so it makes me a bit nervous that I'll look like a total amateur.

I find him really attractive and I think he's really cute so I don't want to mess this up. Any advice?

"Now, I can only speak as a straight man so my experiences probably won't translate too well.

Firstly, is it an excited nervous or don't want to do this nervous? Differentiating between the two is key to what you need to do.

If you're excited, that's fine, everyone is. Remember he wants to meet you after speaking to you, doesn't matter how weird you think you are, he wants to meet.

If you don't want to do this, then don't. Tell him the truth and make it clear it's not his fault, if you'd be willing to meet in the future also make that clear.

Secondly, dates are always awkward, doesn't matter how old you are or how many you've been on.

Dress appropriately but handsomely, my sense of style is somewhat lacking but find an outfit prior to the date that you think looks good on you, don't do it on the day.

Now the big stuff, go at your OWN pace, not his. You are in control of you and NO is a perfectly reasonable answer to any request that makes you feel uncomfortable.

If the date goes well but it doesn't lead anywhere, no problem. There will always be more dates, even if they don't seem like one.

You'll do fine, just be yourself! People are more attractive when they are themselves, you like trains? Awesome. You like dirt biking? That sounds cool.

"Hello! So I have some advice I'd like to offer you as someone who's dated a few people
First things first - careful with the drinking. You probably know that yourself, but really do bear it in mind. I've definitely fucked myself up too fast and ended up on the floor - not at all sexy. Try to have a pint of water with every drink, it'll really slow you down - and keep you hydrated.
For conversation starters - there's actually quite a few online, but I think the most famous is NYT'S 30 something questions that lead to love. No need to take it too serious, or get through them all, but my partner and I did them - twice.
Maybe most importantly - don't be afraid to say if you're a little nervous? A nice person will be understanding, and, it's often kind of endearing to know someone's nervous.
Prepare yourself to say no at some points, and think about what you'd like to do and what you might not like to do. But don't feel bad if you change your mind in the moment. Just prepare for the idea he might like to kiss you or touch you.
I hope your date goes well and you enjoy it"	NotSusEgg	reply	na	na	na	0.001687032519839704	weak	strong	no	na	relationships
I've done a lot of dating, both men and women lol. I'd just say don't drink too much, try to have a good back and forth conversation flow where you ask him questions about himself and share how you relate to him if you can, and don't sweat it too much! A lot of keeping your cool and having a good time when you're nervous for a date is to just fake it til you make it, its worked out well for me even as an anxious person haha.

"Don't worry about being straight! I'm sure the pains of first dates are probably universal lol

I do think I want to meet, I didn't feel ready for a relationship all the way through High school but after doing a lotta work on myself after high school I feel ready to have a boyfriend.

Yeah I found out an outfit the second I agreed to the date, not over the top but nice.

Thank you! I will just try to be my self. So far he hasn't pressured me into anything I don't want to do, we both made it clear at the start that neither of us like doing sex immediately. I don't mind kissing and hugging but ig just flirting I find difficult, because if you respond badly to it it looks like you're not interested when it's really just that you're not equipped for that sorta stuff? My family aren't very affectionate, no body contact or phrases like I love you which I don't think is bad it's just how we operate, but makes it confusing when people outside my family start being more lovey dovey haha

"A suggestion from me is go for coffee or something along those lines.

It'll be a public area, as everyone's safety is paramount.

This will give you both and escape if it starts to go weird, also you can discuss further meeting if it goes well.

I get you, I'm awkward as fuck when it comes to flirting but being yourself alleviates some of that.

Same here, I still struggle to say love you to my parents (I'm 32 for context).

We dated while she was in college(20F, 25M). I was an alcoholic who had no real control over myself, I made a lot of mistakes during this relationship. I spent the time we were together usually black out or working, I know it was wrong.

She ended up leaving me because I wouldn’t stop drinking. This was 2 years ago.

For the past year, she has been hunting my accounts down and slandering me.

I have an account meant for alcoholism, she sends me messages telling me to drink myself to you know where. She calls me all types of horrible things

You sound like you're in denial. Have you considered that your old friend had issues with you but didn't feel safe raising them if she was the only one to talk about it?

I get that this is making your efforts at recovery more difficult. I think /u/Voleuse is right though - there are plenty of ways to block people to keep the messages from reaching you.

If she's posting false statements publicly where other people can see it, then consulting a lawyer is probably your next best avenue for relief.

"TLDR warning 

I M(20) and my best friend F(21) have an unusual relationship. We met when I was going through an emotionally traumatic situationship. We helped each other through our issues. As such we grew very close over time. However as I find myself grow closer to her, I find it more difficult to keep whatever this is going. You see I had learnt from my past rocky relationships not to be too trusting. So I would really be there for her as a supportive friend. Someone that will have your back, that’s it.

I nicely diverted her advances, even though there was a voice in my head telling me to go for it.
She’s someone that gets around quite a bit. Perhaps it’s a coping mechanism for her childhood trauma. Whatever the case I promised her and myself that I wouldn’t judge and be there if she ever needs anything. It wasn’t until one night as we went on a night out where we were both drunk and one thing led to another and we crossed that boundary of just friends. At that point I couldn’t hide my feelings anymore. She on the other hand, adopted the “pretend it didn’t happen” attitude. Of course I respected that and have not brought it up since. I compartmentalised and went back to being pure platonic friends. However every time she would drink she becomes clingy and telling me things sober her would never utter. 

I even tried setting her up with people so that I could by necessity, move on. She would then complain to her girl friends (our shared friends) that she doesn’t want other people and nonsense like that. I thought to myself that maybe I shouldn’t let my past experiences dictate what happens here. Maybe she’s different. So, as dumb as I am, I decided to fully pursue it. It went well. She was happier and reciprocating. Or so I thought. She would continuously introduce me to to all these guys she seems overly friendly with, whom I find out later she had slept with. 

Still I decided to bite my tongue and overlook these things. Plenty of guys get around too and I care too much about her to let something like this affect it. I decided to officially take her out on a date when after a sober night out I saw her act around me like the way she does drunk. I thought it was a sign. The date went well in my eyes. We grew closer, even our mutual friends could tell we might begin a blossoming relationship. I was ready to confess at that point. That was until she told me she was staying over at this guys house she met from the nightclub. It was like a dagger in my heart. I know her well enough to know that these sleepovers only end one way for her. She continued to show me this guys profile and how rich and successful he was while being on a date wth me. 

I’ve since come to the understanding that she may not want a relationship at this point in time. This may be what she want to do right now. I just don’t know if I have it in me to keep walls down long enough to wait for her."	yeatheboys32	post	19.765577453064417	male	White	0.010346904397010803	na	na	na	1	relationships

"**TL;DR: Girlfriend has a male online friend she's known for a long time. This friend talks about his sex life a lot to her and treats her as a counsellor to confide in her about his personal mental health issues. I find the fact he's talking about his sex life weird and it upsets me. Not sure if my feeling is valid, or just some overprotective boyfriend jealousy.**

My (30/M) girlfriend (28/F) has an online male friend (30/M). They have been chatting for a long time, maybe 4-5 years, so since before she met me (we've been together around 1 year), and they never met in real life. Originally he lived in a far away city, though recently he moved to a city about 2 hours away, so there's a chance they might meet up in the near future.

They talk about mundane things, but the thing that I find weird is that he tells her a lot about his sex life. He's kind of a playboy, but mainly because he sees himself as a failure in everything else in life so he does it to boost his self-esteem. My girlfriend acts as a sort of counsellor to him whilst also enjoying hearing about his drama. As far as I can see, she sees him as a friend, and he sees her as someone to vent his emotional distress towards.

To me, I trust that she sees him as a friend, but I do find the fact they talk about his sex life a lot kinda weird and upsetting. Sometimes I get worried that he secretly loves her or something, but she reassures me that if he was after her for a relationship he wouldn't be spilling so much to her about how he's so messed up emotionally. In any case, I just think he should know better that it's inappropriate to talk to somebody's girlfriend about his sex life.

I'm not sure if my perspective has some truth to it or whether it's just fuelled by some jealous instinct or whatever. For what it's worth, she has other male friends that I do not feel any issue with."	ehm1883	post	13.952731770636133	male	White	0.997154712677002	na	na	na	8	relationships

How would you respond to this comment from your spouse?

My husband works from home as an accountant. I am a stay at home parent. We have 2 kids, one of them is disabled and has high needs (autism and ID). I also do all of the household chores and parenting duties. An example of how things are: tonight my husband is putting our kids to bed for the FIRST time ever (after grumbling about me not reminding him that we were starting this routine tonight) - they are almost 7 and 3 years old.

With all the things I have to do and manage (in terms of our oldest child's therapies, medicine, and equipment), I also order the groceries, plan meals and cook dinners. I am NOT a good cook and I don't enjoy doing it. I want to get better, it's just hard to find the time. 

A few weeks ago, I told my husband (as I had several times before) that I was really struggling with the grocery order. This was before I had started ADHD medication. I have always struggled with mundane tasks like these. 

This is what he said to me:

If we were to switch places in terms of jobs, you would have been fired. 

I didn't understand so I asked him to elaborate. 

He said that he doesn't get to slack off without there being consequences so for example if I don't make a list, we don't get groceries and if we don't have groceries, we don't eat. 


I remember nodding and leaving it at that. I have told him many times that I don't deliberately forget things. He has said it's because I'm inconsiderate and disrespectful even AFTER I got an ADHD diagnosis. 

What would you have said/done?

Tl;dr I'm trying to understand if I'm being irrational. My husband makes me feel like I'm going crazy."	Nice-Swan-9313	post	32.36594224579713	female	White	0.9970941543579102	na	na	na	20	relationships

"My (27F) sister (26F) has been going to therapy every week for over a year. She currently sees at least 2 and maybe 3 therapists. She sees each of them separately and sees each of them weekly. I think it's too much and it's making things worse.

My sister has always been somewhat hard to be around.  She is very entitled and rarely takes accountability for anything.  Therapy seems to have exacerbated those things. 
 Since starting therapy, and especially since adding these extra therapists, I have seen my sister become withdrawn and combative. She likes to use therapy-talk for everything. She thinks that when my dad concludes giving a piece of advice by saying, ""take it or leave it,"" he is actually forcing her to do excessive emotional labor to validate him. When I need to finish whatever I'm working on before talking to her, I am actually not giving space for her feelings. And so on. Most importantly, these are not just observations or comments that she is making. This is how she starts fights. She is extremely confrontational about these kinds of things and it can be baffling. She has ended her relationship with my dad because of this. My poor dad is heartbroken and doesn't understand why she won't give him the time of day. My sister preaches the importance of communication and respect, but she will not tell him why she has cut him off.

I have the displeasure of living with her since I'm trying to save money as a student (I graduate and can escape in less than a year now). This type of stuff makes her unbearable to be around. It is hurting my family. It is also hurting my sister. She has no friends and she can't keep a job because, surprisingly enough, most people won't tolerate that nonsense. Of course, in her eyes, everyone else is to blame for her own misfortune.

My sister shuts down when people give her advice, feedback, and/or criticism. If I tell her directly thay I think she needs to cut back on or quit therapy, she will definitely reject that and may cut me out like she did with our dad. Any ideas on how I can approach this issue delicately?

Tldr:  My sister goes to an excessive amount of therapy.  It seems to have exacerbated her problems and become a crutch for her.  She is quick to cut even family from her life for minor things.  How can I tell her that she needs to cut back on therapy?"	Intelligent_Pack_647	post	21.030884231579947	male	White	0.9993430972099304	na	na	na	8	relationships

"Hello, I'm asking this since I'm (15f) in highschool and have wanted a partner for a long time. (I'm kind of a hopeless romantic) since there are so many people in highschool, I know it should be easier, but I'm not sure if I count as ""attractive"". I know that it's all preference, but I always see these pretty girls with big breasts, big hips, and a tiny waist. I know that stereotypes and media is stupid, but it's what's hot. I'm pretty far from the ""pretty girl"" thing. Yes, I got larger breasts and hips, but I also have a bit of a tummy (it's apparently not from being ""fat"", I think it's a part of the body type) and thunder thighs. I'm also quite short than what's considered an attractive height (I'm quite literally not  an inch over five foot) and there are types. I dunno when this started, or why, but I seem to like the more soft, quiet, more feminine like boys (again, dunno when or how it started) but I've never actually met any, since all of my junior high classmate boys were those annoying dudes that basically think their the best since they work out at the gym. Why is it that all ""pretty"" dudes seem to always be gay? (Yeah, that was unrelated, but still) I know I shouldn't be picky and stuff, so I try to keep an open mind. Can somebody give me advice in this? (,Oh yeah, another problem is I don't have the courage to ask anyone out, so maybe some tips on that would help as well. Thank you!)

"Anyone worth being in a relationship with will not be grading your height and other attributes against a scale of perfection, they'll be seeing you as a whole person.

When you're 15, people are still learning about what they like and what makes a good partner and screw up until they get it right. Some people never learn but we all start at the beginning.

"15 is very young!

Focus on thinking about your future for now, what kind of life you'd be interested in living, what type of skills and/or careers interest you. Start actively building your skill in that area, and talk to young adults who are in university or starting their careers in those fields, ask questions.

You should always have at least one personal project, whether that's writing for a student zine, illustrating a character, creating a website, starting a blog about social or scientific issues, participating in student hackathons, starting a garden.

Also, building a workout practice at your age is critical. I'd recommend dance because it's actually fun, I know there are amateur k-pop dance groups that teens run, and they hold performances, if more expensive dance schools aren't an option.

Romance will occur naturally, and will be most fulfilling if you are both actively chasing your dreams and inspiring eachother to do so. The less time you spend thinking about boys, the better. Develop confidence and self-respect by developing a vision for your life and acting on it every day.

"Don't worry about your looks. I know this may be a lost cause considering the crazy amount of media shovelled at ppl these days but, seriously. 

Deciding whether or not you're attractive isn't a choice made by other people: it's your choice. You wanna be attractive? Congrats, you are. You can see yourself and find things you like yes? You don't need to compete with others to be attractive at all, it's just a matter of personal belief. Plenty of conventionally attractive ppl think they're ugly. It's all in how you see yourself. Be attractive to you first.

Bc: think about it. If you're conventionally attractive, it's widely accepted, shown, complemented, etc it's easier to grow self confidence. Easier to feel good in your body and about yourself. But you don't need conventional looks to reach that state of feeling good in yourself and your body. Or, to enjoy your body. It might be a little less easy in comparison, but you can still get that self confidence !! So don't worry about being attractive for a guy, do it for you!

People are attracted to what's inside. Sure some ppl may be hot on the outside, but if they're assholes then it's useless. Everyone grows old eventually, all looks fade regardless. When you're in a relationship, often ppl just become more attractive over time, even if they're not conventionally attractive. It's like the person they are on the inside outshines everything. So don't even worry about looks at all, I'm absolutely dead serious. As long as you shower and have basic hygiene lmao I think you'll be fine

Last random tips: if you pick up a hobby where you're part of a group and meet once a week, that can be a great way to meet people. Friends of friends is another way. But altogether, it's better to be single and free rather than be stuck in an unhealthy relationship so don't rush into it. Relationships aren't 24/7 contact and emotional support, you're still gonna be on your own sometimes and deal with your own emotions sometimes, and have your own life and goals and friends lol. So if you're comfortable as an individual, that's very helpful."	-KiaraNebula-	reply	na	na	na	0.9901229739189148	weak	no	no	na	relationships
"My boyfriend and I have been together for some time now. A little over a year and a half. We have a good relationship emotionally and physically. The only obstacle seems to be his family. I’ve never met my dad, and I have no relationship with my Mom. I felt touched when his family included me almost immediately in everything.  Dinners, trips, family events, etc. But as time has gone by, there are so many red flags. 

Please don’t tell me to “run” or “leave”. I’ve thought about it, but I truly love him. And want to help him with this as he seems like he desperately wants to get out of this. Here are some “off”  things  with his mom. 

* He’s never moved away from home. His parents pay all of his bills. Phone, car, etc. 

* His mom cleans out his work lunch box, folds his laundry. He tells me he hates it , but the second he walks away, it’s done for him. 

* Whenever he’s at my apartment, there’s always a text from him. One day while he came over straight after work she texts him “You’re working late? Are you coming over for dinner” She texts him every single time. And when he says he’s staying over she says “Oh. Ok” 

* He lacks basic life skills. Knowing how to budget, how much things cost. Deal with life situations, etc.
  
* One day while we went out together as a family, we went to an arcade/food place, and my boyfriend asked me what I wanted to eat. I said I’m fine with whatever. He jokingly said “You’re in charge here whatever u wanna eat” and his mother came out of nowhere and said “I thought I was in charge here “

* In his efforts to become more independent, he said to his parents that he wants to start paying his own car insurance. They told him that they have a “thing” where they want to pay for him and his brother’s insurance until they were 28 and that was that. He can’t even do it if he wanted to now, because the car was financed in his parents name. And it’s registered to him. 

* When I got my apartment the end of last year, his mom wanted to come over to “see how it came together” I was uncomfortable with that since he’s not living there. And it’s my place. He told me it comes from a place of curiosity but I don’t believe it.  

* Since I got this apartment, we spend more time here than his parents house. Whenever I come over (which is at least monthly) His parents “jokingly” said , “We never see you anymore. Always in _____ (the town I live in) to him. 

* Whenever we’ve gone on outings together with his family, his mom dominates the whole trip. Him and I can never seem to just hang to the side for a moment , they all have to do everything together all the time every second. 

* One day while we were talking about getting married one day in the future, I said I’ve always wanted to have an “elopement” Vegas wedding. He said “Yeah that sounds fun but my mom would be SO mad” 

* Sometimes his Mom does things to “embarrass him” I put it in quotes because I don’t find it personally embarrassing, but she will say things about him as a baby, show baby pictures, and “funny” embarrassing stories when he was a baby. 

I’m very torn because I know he’s a grown adult, and can put a stop to this, and it seems like he wants to because he always complains, and seems to make an effort. But he’s so compliant, and stuck. He doesn’t want confrontation, and is ridden with anxiety and self doubt. And his mother is not nasty to me, but actually quite kind. My mother is abusive and has never loved or cared about me so sometimes it’s hard to judge what normal parent/adult child relationships look like. 

I don’t want to end things with him because he’s genuinely a kind hearted, empathetic, and sweet guy. I’ve brought up my concerns to him, and told him I need him to become independent. He’s trying, and he agrees that his Mom is too much. But I just don’t know how to navigate this long term. Should I talk to his Mom? Set boundaries? How can I help him, and this relationship? 

TLDR : Boyfriends mom is a nice lady, but she’s too much. I need to know how I can work through this because I truly love him."	throwra-sprinkles1	post	20.823498993728293	male	White	0.07129469513893127	na	na	na	4	relationships

"I'm sorry but:

> Please don’t tell me to “run” or “leave”. I’ve thought about it, but I truly love him. 

...you may have come to the wrong place.  Because people around here understand full well that love *isn't* enough, *isn't* all you need, and *cannot* overcome every problem.

Here's the thing:

> I’m very torn because I know he’s a grown adult, and can put a stop to this, and it seems like he wants to because he always complains, and seems to make an effort.

People do *exactly* what they want to do.  Every single time.  They put their time, effort, and energy into those things that are important to them, and they put less (or none) into things that are less (or not) important.

What's more, a person's *words* tell you who it is that he wants you to *think* he is (even, in some cases, who *he* wants to believe he is)...but his *actions* show you -- prove to you -- who he *actually* is: who he *chooses to be*.

So.  He talks a lot of talk about How Awful Things Are And I Have To Get Out Of This...but yet he has not left.  He has put in token effort, and then when he met resistance, he just caved, because the actual effort required to truly escape from her gravity well is more effort than he is willing to put into it.

One of two things is happening.  Either:

1. He has a *need* (which he may not even be aware of), which he believes (whether consciously or subconsciously) that can only be met by staying in the situation he's in, so any time he considers getting *out* of it, that need rears its ugly head, and he backs down so that he won't lose (what he perceives to be) the only way he can have that need met.  Or,

2. He has some *fear* (which he may or may not be consciously aware of) about what would (or could, or might) happen if he were to leave the nest, and any time he starts to move toward doing so, that fear reasserts itself and he shies away.

It's one of those two.  I'll bet you a shiny new nickel.

And here's the thing:

Because he is *choosing* to stay in this situation (even if only tacitly, by *not* choosing to get out of it), this is where he'll stay.  Because (all of his complaining about things notwithstanding) *he is living the life that he wants to live*. The life that either meets the needs hes, or assuages the fears he holds.

*And you cannot change him*.

He will only change if he *wants* to change.  You cannot make him *want* to change.  That has to come from within him, or it will never happen.

So unless and until he *wants* to change, meaning that he has come to the conclusion that ""what he will get if he leaves"" is worth *more* to him than ""what he will get if he stays"", he'll never move an inch.  What's more, it's not *just* a factor of how much he wants what leaving will get him; he will also have to factor in the cost (in terms of time, effort, emotional energy, and even money) that it will take to leave.

So if ""what he will get if he leaves"" is not *clearly* worth more to him than ""What he is already getting"" *plus* ""what it would cost him to go through the process of leaving""...

...here he is to stay.

> I don’t want to end things with him because he’s genuinely a kind hearted, empathetic, and sweet guy.

You don't *have* to end things with him.

But what you *do* have to do is accept that this is who he is, accept that there's every likelihood that he's not going to change, accept that there's every likelihood therefore that this is how things are going to *remain*, accept that it's a virtual certainty that everything that you described about his mother's involvement in your relationship *will continue from now on with no end in sight*...

...and that if you stay with him, you no longer have the right to be *mad* about it.

Because you *could* leave.  You *could* be quit of all of her interference and meddling and overbearing and controlling and so forth.  But because you are *choosing* to stay in a situation like this, the consequences of that situation from here on out are on *you*.

A person who refuses to come in from the snow doesn't get to complain that it's cold.

So choose what you want *more*: being with this particular guy, or being free from this particular woman.

"You can stay. That's your choice.  But, IF he ever actually leaves home, you will be his replacement caretaker.  And love won't be enough.

"Let me provide you with a perspective from a guy who's in the same situation as your boyfriend.

All of our lives, the mother has been in control and overbearing of everything. There is no room to make our own decisions whether it is folding, paying, chores, or literally anything. We were robbed or our ability to grow and be independent and were forced to just listen and deal with it. A part of the problem is that all of this overbearing is coming from a place of love and caring so it's a lot more complicated than realizing that the overbearing is bad. It doesn't have malicious intent so it's not something that just be broken off. We care about our mothers. However, after years of overbearing, we have been accustomed our mothers controlling everything. We don't know how to do be independent, and we were never taught to be independent. We are also constantly being guilt tripped by our mothers as well to stay like a close family. From the outside, it 's easy to say that we are choosing to accept this family dynamic and choosing not to change, but people don't understand is that it's never felt like we've had a choice to do anything. We don't know what being able to choose to do our own thing feels like or even know how to do that or that it is possible.

If you would like to stay with him and have him grow up, it's going to take quite some time. I would start with having you and him read Peter Pan Syndrome by Dan Kiley, talking about boys that never grew up. Eventually I would suggest therapy or an accountability partner because he ultimately needs to learn to set and enforce BOUNDARIES. He needs to learn to set boundaries with his mother. His mother has overstepped all boundaries allowing no room for privacy and independence. This will likely be shocking and upsetting to his mother. She will think that she is being distanced or separated from her son, but really he should be framing this conversation in a way that he would like a healthy relationship with boundaries so that he can grow up and be an independent adult. The only way that happens is if boundaries are set and enforced, and he is given room to grow instead of being smothered with love.

It can be more gradual like starting to pay his own car insurance or do his laundry or taxes, but he needs to set these boundaries and follow through. If mom continues to violate boundaries, then he needs to start taking steps to move out.

Good luck to you both and hope this helps."	throwra-sprinkles1	reply	na	na	na	0.07129469513893127	no	strong	no	na	relationships

Just a heads up: it’s unlabeled but he told me he likes me and I am starting to like him too, also we flirt a lot and recently exchanged nudes too. We talked about a friends with benefits situation before he told me he liked me but since we live in different areas we couldn’t have sex. He is planning to visit soon so sex is still on the table but he did mention that it isn’t all he wants with me. 

Anyways the issue that is bothering me is that he always texts me whenever he finds another woman attractive. As in if he is on the train to work or at the local airport or just in the street he will text stuff like “the lady in front of me is really hot” “the lady that was walking by was really thick” stuff like that. 
He would also send pictures of sexy ladies online that he found like on tiktok or Instagram. 

Here is the thing before there was anything between us I did mention that I find women attractive like I am not necessarily bi but I might be bicurious so I used to (still do) hype up the women he sends with comments like DAMNNN or like comment of how much of a bombshell she is. And once I sent his a video of a lady does thirst traps because I found her really hot. So I feel like I kind of encouraged the sexualise in a way 

Before we started sexting it wasn’t much of an issue but now when he does this I feel a bit like I will never compare because genuinely I will never. No matter how hard I try I can’t change the fact that I have a small ass and boobs and short hair, I go the gym and all but it won’t make me half as curvy as these women. He really likes long hair. 


The thing is he told me he liked me from the very first time we played the game online together. So like that means even while he was interested in me he kept looking at other women and telling me about it. So I don’t know if he meant it as negging or is he genuinely just comfortable enough to not have any filters (he told me before that I make him feel so safe like he doesn’t need to have any filters on) 

I don’t want to tell him it kinda makes me insecure beca 1)I am an extremely self conscious person and everything makes me insecure 2) if he is doing out of comfort I really don’t want him to start putting on filter and being on guard with me. 

But this makes me feel like he isn’t attracted to me at all but just had to settle down for my looks since he likes my personality (I heard a lady talking about how the same thing happened to her that her bf wasn’t really physically attracted to her so he started resenting the relationship as things went on so I am curious if that’s the case here)

TL;DR my situationship keeps sending me messages when he finds other women attractive or videos/picture of hot ladies online."	Moonshinesapphic	post	31.25561170739195	female	White	0.014248850755393505	na	na	na	28	relationships
No idea how it started but you are certainly encouraging it with your reactions.  He's going to keep doing it as long as you keep responding like you do.

So this was a thing he was doing before you started getting more intimate? Have you told him anything about how you feel when he does this? Because if you're long distance and this is mostly going over text, I can definitely see how he's not going to get that you don't want to see this stuff.

Online sexting relationships can be fun for a while, and I'm all for FWBs, but this guy is *a trash partner*. If he's already being *a trash partner* now, it's only gonna get worse if you get more deeply involved.

He may or may not be negging you, but what he is doing is keeping the situationship highly sexual and objectifying in general. Even a real FWB sort of person should be *more friendly* than that.

They tell stories to themselves, and just don't consider you as a real, full person, but a side character in thier personal story. This is an especially big risk online. He probably said what he thought was true in the moment, but had no follow through. 

Which is why you have to watch what they *do*, not what they *say*.

And what he is doing, is shitty, unfriendly, and unkind.

"That’s where the friends before we dated part helped. I trusted him a lot and I never felt insecure with him because of that trust, even though obviously there were issues because we’re no longer together. The issues were more along the lines of location we wanted to live and financial incompatibility. 

Here’s my example. I have brown hair and I give off the “girl next door” vibes I guess. Pretty average in looks, I don’t stand out but I’m not hideous. I’m “cute” not “hot.” He was really into redheads - there was one day where he was VERY bored and sent me like . . . 80 pictures of online redheads 🤣 it was fine, and I enjoyed seeing all the different shades of red hair that exist in the world. 

Now? I’ve been where you are now - the guy I really liked has a very different physical and personality type (think tiny, cute, tsunderes from anime vibe) from me, and it *did* make me very insecure, but it’s because I also don’t really trust him around girls due to things I’ve seen him do. I’ll be honest, he’d have to change quite a bit for me to ever believe anything he says about my looks, because of how deep those issues run between us now.

"People can be totally honestly, totally full of shit. 

The idea of self-stories is all throughout mindfulness, cognitive behavioural therapy, any sort of coaching and all sorts of affirmation/visualization practices. It's easy to find tons of stuff about how the stories you tell yourself, about yourself, can change how you relate and what you believe.

It's much harder to watch out and listen for the stories other people tell themselves, especially the ones t*hey tell themselves about you*. Because those stories can also have a major impact. The obvious example is in abuse, where the victim is told they are ugly or stupid long enough they tend to believe it, but it's not a true story or a good reflection of the full person.

But there are less toxic examples too, like for the longest time my little sister believed I always had my shit together and I never fought with our Mom.

"TL;DR - My partner dated me when I was a woman, I came out as a man and they're struggling to come to terms. They love me and wants to work through this. But we dont know what to do or what to try.

Me (19 male born female) and my partner (21 nonbinary born female) met each other three years ago and we have been in a happy relationship ever since. I met them when they where using they/them pronouns and they met me when I was using she/her pronouns. Recently though, after having a talk with my partner, I have started using he/him pronouns, I have made a few changes like cut my hair shorter and using a different name.  I came out as a man. It has been hard for my partner to process the fact that I will change, they will still and do still love me more than anything, we have talked about this and leaving each other is definitely not an option for both of us. When I say change I don't mean change in a way of ""Oh no it's a man now!"" They have never been transphobic in the slightest and is a trans advocate. I mean change in the way of it feels to them like I am changing as a person and am no longer be the person they fell in love with when we first met. The change is what's the scary part for them. They have dated men , and always felt like they were missing something and longing for something. They didn't feel the same when dating a woman. I don't blame them for feeling this way and I completely understand, it's all very valid feelings and emotions to have. They have spoke to me about how my personality has changed to a point where there is very little left of the person they met. And they know that people are meant to change, change is needed to grow. But they're not good with change. They are trying.  But now I am also physically going to change. My long hair was one of their favorite things about my looks( they love my personality and heart more) but now that's gone. Soon other things might change too. We have talked about this before and have discussed options we think would work or help make the process easier, like I suggested them having their own girlfriend if that's what they wanted and they said they only want to date me. They feel like dating someone else whilst dating me is wrong and unfair to me. It wouldn't be even and they fear it would make me sad. Giving each other space was an option we came to and we both agreed that we wouldn't want that. We do everything together and physically cant do without each other, 
for example feeding our horses. Breaking up was also a option that occurred to us and we also weren't willing to take that one. We love each other too much for that. We know this will take time and we both know that we wont leave each other but we also dont either of us to be unhappy in the relationship.

"change IS scary! Especially within a relationship where you just don't know what this new, big change will look like. There are a lot of unknowns for your partner right now. Even if they're supportive, knowing you're starting a new journey for yourself means change and that means uncertainty.

Do either or both of you have support in the form of therapists or trusted mentors or something? Having spaces to discuss things (worries, etc) together and separately could be really beneficial."	crustysock4207	reply	na	na	na	0.4636862576007843	weak	no	no	na	relationships
"Change is never easy. And when that change is such an identity issue as … identity, it’s going to be really not easy.

To you: be yourself.

To your partner: also be yourself- and don’t assume that being an ally means you can’t have preferences.

I hope you can find space (both physically and metaphorical) to work out your feelings and attractions in a good way. And even if the end result is that you two aren’t together as a couple, that is ok."	crustysock4207	reply	na	na	na	0.4636862576007843	weak	no	no	na	relationships

"So, i wanna start by saying that this is a 3 year old relationship with much love, fun and intimacy, and that i am very much in love with her. Things got a bit weird between us when we got into college and a lot of new people got introduced in my life. She has always been the kindest person in the world with me, even though she would sometimes say low things when we were having a fight. I´ve always had a flirty personality and most people would consider me good looking, which ended up with me hooking up with many girls from my town, some of which her old friends, and something that was bothered her since the beginning. Ever since we started dating i cut all contact with previous flings and toned down my flirtiness by 1000. Now, in college, she changed. She says i dont love her like she loves me, when i show her that i adore her every single day, in her love languages. If i tell her something that bothers me she says that "" you're so perfect and im so bad, i get it "". a Few weeks ago she yelled at me in front of her friends, then she said im selfish and i only care about my self because i was focusing on my exams. All these fights are becoming much more frequent, and she´ll always end up by saying that i dont love her like she loves me, and i really don´t know what to do anymore. More and more girls from my college flirt with me, and sometimes, in between this awful things she says to me, i catch myself thinking about them. She has anxiety and i think that me being around so many girls is setting her off, i´ve asked her multiple times to try to change this behavior but she always comes back. Apart from those things, the relationship is perfect 99% of the time. Are these sings of a toxix relationship coming to be?

TL;DR- My 3 year old relationship has become increasingly toxic in the last year and a half"	Practical-Gold9461	post	15.295128720491629	male	White	0.9942395687103271	na	na	na	1	relationships
She needs constant reassuring. If it’s something you can handle long term, keep going. However, as I always say, prioritise your own feelings. It isn’t fair on her to always feel like she’s not enough for you, and it isn’t fair to you to always have to plead your case.

I had some pretty heavy trauma for awhile that I resolved with the help of a counselor. But being able to open up to guys about what I experienced was a whole different story. I worried for a long time that I was just interested in guys, just because they were nice to me, and that was it. Mistaking kindness for flirting. You know? 

I then had this guy come into my life who was my age, and we clicked instantly. And I told him my trauma. Things even my family didn’t know. I still have no idea why I did it. But he knew all of it and said it didn’t bother him, and that he’s “always got me” my anxiety attacks, panic attacks, never bothered him. We ended up parting ways because I realized I still needed to heal before I could date. And now I am healed. I went back on dating apps, and that spark I felt with this guy, wouldn’t come back. And I found some really attractive men on the app. But ever since I met this guy, and shared with him my trauma, it’s never been the same for me in the dating world. 

TL;DR guy accepted me for my trauma."	ThrowRAtwinklel	post	19.719802895570503	female	White	0.0017838341882452369	na	na	na	1	relationships
"hi from personal experience I can tell you that sharing your trauma can be a challenging task and when we do share then it feels like the end of the world. It's easy to feel that this rapport can never be replicated. However, you'll have to take charge of your emotions and trauma and whoever you decide to take next you'll have to actively try and rebuild that rapport with them otherwise you're failing yourself and the next guy.

I know it will seem like the end of the world but it's really not. As far as I can tell, the attachment you felt for the person is because of the parts that you allowed yourself to share with him and when that doesn't pan out it's logical to feel a void in your life which can't really be filled. 

But this is upto you, and what active decisions you take to rebuild that rapport with another person. Take it one step at a time it'll seem really triggering at first but you'll eventually ease into another bond, just be honest with it."

"Hi all just a quick one, me and my gf are getting really serious now to the point she’s saying I’m the love of her life and plans to extend our family with a child together, but I have this burning pain in the pit of stomach, I found out recently after her telling me she wasn’t the person to send others nude pictures/videos etc and it was only me that made her comfortable to do so it was a lie as she sent some to another person before we met and went as far as sending them to me months after when we met pretending that it was her in the moment when really they were three months old when she was messaging this other guy.

Anyway we chatted about it I guess there’s no fix for this it is what it is and I just have to get on with that fact I guess she did apologise for sending videos pretending to be in the moment about us when it wasn’t what she was doing in the moment, fast forward a few days and I know she still has said persons name and number on her phone along with a blank WhatsApp chat (so messages have been deleted but the chat stays there from the day it was started but with no messages) and I can’t help but think she still messages this guy but deletes the messages and that’s why it’s just sitting there as a blank chat, with the date on chat being well over a year ago just before we started dating. I know you can delete individual messages, deleting them all so it goes blank but the chat stays up in your list of chats just blank with the date of when the very first message happened. It just seems odd wouldn’t you just delete the whole chat and that person not even be on there, do you think she’s potentially still chatting to this guy on and off the reason they didn’t get together and stuff she said was because he moved quite far away over an hours drive away. I’m feeling a bit off with it tbh should I approach it and ask has she communicated with this guy since we been together or should I just leave it be and get on with life.

"I think you're overthinking things re: when the nudes were taken. Personally (and bear in mind I am single so not a one to one comparison, but) I only take pics when I look and feel good enough to do so, then they might not get sent to anyone for weeks. And yes, I've sent the same photo to different people when I was dating them, bc it's a great photo and it's still me. The intimacy of sharing is what counts, not the timing.

I think you should ask if she still speaks to this guy since it bothers you, and point out that the blank chat looks suspect because it does, but if her answer doesn't satisfy you it might not be worth staying in the relationship.

"A few thoughts:

* You're really paranoid and getting needlessly jealous over something you don't know to be true. I'm assuming you snooped on her phone to look at her Whatsapp, which isn't cool and hurts your relationship. If you bring this up to her, that's what you're going to look like: a snooper who is paranoid and jealous. 
* It's not cool that she lied to you about the nudes, but you said you talked about it and she apologized. From there, you should try to take her at her word, because a relationship cannot develop unless you learn to trust each other.
* Whether you bring up exes is dependent on how far along your relationship is, and how much you trust each other, and even still some couples never even talk about it. I think bringing up exes is fine, but only if you know you can handle it. I don't think you can handle it right now.

"We are together for 2 years and it is a great relationship, we communicate openly about everything, can navigate any fight and I feel overall really good in this relationship. 

I moved to study in his city in Germany (I am from Russia) and we met there. He is finishing medicine degree and wants to find a job in his home city. He has his whole life here, family friends and he does not want to move even to another city in Germany, which I underatand and accept.

I however have lived in 3 countries already and I have a huge curiosity for exploring cultures, languages and just learning about the life abroad. For now I wanna stay in Germany but I do not feel that happy in the city of my boyfriend, it is quite a concervative state, there are not many young people, I feel quite lonely and there is no art scene (I am an illustrator). I am not unhappy here but I wanna try something new. So I want to move to another city in a different state. 

But I know if I move to another city we will break up, we talked about it does not make sense to keep things going if I am not going to settle down in his town. And my concern is, should I really give up my relationship that is very good for something that I am not even sure I will like (living in another city)? 
Maybe I will just never be happy in a place I live long term?

P.s.We also talked about perfect lifestyle that we imagine for us:
His perfect picture is: we will eventually move in together, we will work 9 to 5, spend evenings with friends, sometimes do hikes on the weekend, do holiday couple of times a year, get kids etc
My perfect picture is: we live in a couple of different countries for several years together, explore it, work flexible hours, get a place as a base somewhere, we do campings or travel in a van for some time, even with kids eventually 

And it seemed so drastically different, I dont know if it is just me romanticizing travel, this whole situation makes me feel like I am the weird one who is ready to trade good relationship for novelty and excitement of a new place...

"Me \[23M\] and Abby \[21F\] (not her real name) are pretty tight. We were both ER techs and worked 12hr shifts in close quarters together, so we got to know each other pretty well. We hit it off immediately and became great friends. I left the ER for a different one a few weeks after we met, but even then we kept hanging out regularly and texting every day.We're just friends, totally platonic, but I feel like the most true version of myself with her. I'm a chronic extrovert and meet a lot of people, and I've only met one other person who I've felt this close to in all my years. We're just on exactly the same wavelength. We don't shut up when we're with each other; I remember one night, I told myself ""I'll send her home at 2am"", then I looked at my phone and it was 5am and we were still talking. One of my favorite moments with her was when I said I was really tired once and wasn't sure if I could drive an hour back to where I live. She then drove me around in her car for an hour so I could sleep, knowing that I sleep freakishly well in cars. She taught me how to ride a bike drunk in my driveway at midnight, after traveling 1hr by train to hang out with me all day, and I still have that damn bike and love it to hell and back.

Recently things have felt weird, though. She's always been a little flaky and usually reschedules things for an hour or so later after we agree, but in the last month or so it's been really bad. I've made plans with her and turned down other people, then when I text if she's still down \~15min before the time we agreed on, I get left on delivered for hours. Sometimes, I'll ask if she's down, she'll say yes, I'll ask when/where, then get left on delivered for \~1hr, and by then I'm in bed.Sometimes we get something to work, like the last time we hung out about 2 weeks ago. Felt totally natural while we were together; I don't think I said anything dumb to offend her to cause this recent behavior pattern. She'd asked how many roommates I had; when I asked why, she said something like ""thinking about if we can host a drinking night here"".

Aaaand now we're back to flakiness and not hanging out.

So, yeah. I miss her. I'm totally overanalyzing everything because I miss my friend. And I'm just hella confused on why everything feels so difficult all of a sudden. I brought it up to her earlier and she said she's just overwhelmed with a specific life issue she's having (one I'm aware of and can confirm it's a good reason why a lot of her brainspace is being taken up at the moment). She's also got ADHD out the ass so she's bad at keeping schedules/remembering stuff. She's \*also\* also got a job where she's pulling 24hr shifts and working hella hours. I want to give her grace, but... I had the same job and I still found time to plan stuff, even if it was in advance.

What do I do? Should I keep reaching out with next-to-zero expectations, or fuck off and let her re-find me again? Is she making plans with me as a backup, then ditching me when someone else comes through? She's quitting her long-hours job in a few months for another, much more normal job, at least. I just don't know what to say or do to keep the friendship.Caveat: we've both mentioned that we're super into each other. We kissed one night while drunk. But then, the next time we hung out, I tried to be flirtatious and got nothing, absolutely 0, in return. I was confused and asked her, and she said that she ""doesn't know if she likes me or if she likes the feeling of being wanted"", so we agreed to not do anything. Now my crush is gone, I moved on to some other gal, but now I'm worried I came off as overbearing somehow. I know how stifling unwanted feelings from another dude are.

But there's just so many possible reasons. I just want to see her in person to hang out and have an irl convo about how it's kinda lame that she's leaving me on delivered all the time when we make plans. Should I keep reaching out, or let her come to me, even if the ball is solidly in her court?

"Good question. The kiss doesn't. The kiss was several months ago and we kept hanging out consistently afterward

For me, it was worth it since she's just fun and being ratchet with her is a break from grad school (which I left the ER tech job for). We also have shared niche interests that I can't find with other people. She was one of my best friends.

I had already left once when the flakiness really started happening, about a month ago. I muted her on a texting app then moved on with my life. She kept texting then eventually yelled my name in all caps into the chat lol and that made me unmute her.

(Another reason why I'm confused. Like, she keeps texting almost daily, and when we hang out she mentions plans like ""we should go biking"" or ""let's eat at X restaurant another time"" but then she flakes and goes unreachable.)

After reading these responses, I decided to mute her again and I'm not taking her off, at least for a while. We can pick up again later when she has less bullshit going on.

"So my bf and I went on our first date in early March and have been seeing each other twice a week unless something came up since and officially got together in early May.

I honestly adore so much about him and everything just feels right, so I told him that I love him last night. It was kind of embedded into a funny context so it wasn't just an ""I love you"" that stood completely for itself.

Because of that I didn't think much of it when he just laughed and commented that that was cute while he was putting his shirt on at first, but then he stepped back to the bed and leaned over me and looked me deep into my eyes and said some stuff about how incredible I am and that there are no words to describe how great I am and that really could've been the moment for him to say that he loves me too if he wanted to. But he didn't say that.

Initially it's not like I said it *because* I wanted him to say it back, I really initially just said it because it fit the context and I've felt it and had been wanting to say it for a little while now, but when I said it and he didn't say it back in the perfect context to say it if he did want to, it made me feel kinda dumb and like I shouldn't have said it because it's too early.

This is my first relationship and he definitely has more relationship experience so maybe it was too early?

He compliments everything about me all the time and he's super duper affectionate, so I'm just really surprised he didn't say it back.

I kinda don't know if I should talk to him about it since I don't wanna make him feel pressured or guilted into saying it if he's not feeling it, so I'm just kinda lost.

It upset me, but I blamed the crying on the fact that he's leaving soom to work abroad for 10 months to him since I didn't wanna tell him that it was really that exchange that upset me. I didn't wanna lie, but I didn't know what else to do.

"Ive been questioning if I truly ever loved him the way he loves me. I care about him, I do, but he has never given me that feeling of heart-racing, absolutely obsessed love that I had with a previous partner; but that relationship ended on very bad terms. Ive considered that Im just trying to replicate the love I felt for someone before things got bad.

I've considered that I've settled and that I'm just with him because I know he has nowhere to go. He was living with a cousin (27M) before we met, but that cousin has now turned back to his severely drug addicted family and theres no way he could go back to live with him in fear of potentially ending up like the rest of his family. He does have other friends, but I doubt they'd let him crash with them as they already have a full house. As far as Im aware, his cousin has moved back in with his mother, so he's let their previous rental arrangement lapse.

There's a part of me that probably wouldn't feel bad if he just walked-out and decided to end the relationship, in some sense I may be grateful because I wouldn't have to make the decision, but theres another part of me that gets extremely upset at the idea of him going away for forever. We haven't been physically intimate in three years and that is due to me. I just don't have the desire. Its not that I don't find him attractive, I do, but those feelings just aren't there. It gets even worse when I feel like he's begging me for it. I'm not the type to put on an act and ""pretend."" Ive had conversations with him about it but its like he doesn't understand or gets awkward.

Ive also considered that im severely depressed and therapy/prescribed drugs aren't helping.

TD;LR, Maybe I was never in love with my boyfriend of 4yrs because I was just trying to replace the feelings I had with an ex-lover. Maybe I'm just with him because I feel sorry for him because he has no one else due to a severely drug addicted family.

"From talking it out with a therapist, he was my first *everything*. First serious relationship, first sexual partner, first love, so there's a lot of raw first feelings that I probably won't ever be able to replicate with another person.

The relationship in itself was toxic. He was mentally abusive. I started to go to therapy because of him.. i found myself really struggling with my self worth and becoming very depressed - I'm still depressed. Which is why its continued all these years. We were on again off again and that in itself isn't healthy, but we were also teenagers and young adults and didn't understand boundaries and what it meant to have a healthy relationship. In the beginning he made me feel very special. I would get excited just thinking about the possibility of seeing him. The butterflies never went away sort of feeling.

"The guy I’m seeing still is in contact with his first girlfriend and their entire family. Enough so that they ask him for money. The sisters and bothers. Which he has given, it’s his money he chooses what he wants to spend it on. Whatever. The thing is, I’ve paid my way on our dates, my car got smashed so he lets me borrow his, BUT within conditions that the gas is exactly where it was when I borrowed it….he asked me to pick up his medication which was expensive. I have been very greedy in past relationships and the guilt I feel with that I put towards being a more self aware generous person. 

So this is where it bothers me. His exs sister got into some trouble. She got scammed 2k. I guess she doesn’t have a job and he’s lent her (given her) lots of money. So he has charges against him, he’s in weed business and he mentioned to her he’ll give her 30k if she takes responsibility for his charges. When he said this it made me sick to my stomach so I asked him to leave. I didn’t want to keep hanging out with him.

I just hate that he would do something like that all together manipulating her with his money deal but even the fact he’s so generous with giving money yet has been so stern with me paying my own way for everything…. Especially because exs in the past have insisted to buy my groceries, take me on dates, not expect gas money, buy me flowers and sweet things which he also got me nothing on my bday. 

I don’t know, he has a lot of great traits but this may be a deal breaker for me personally. I just don’t know if I’m being dramatic with the money charges thing or what. Thoughts? Thanks.

TLDR; the guy I’m seeing has asked his exs sister if she’d would take his charges for 25k because she’s in a rough spot financially…it feels dirty and gross and idk"	Royalsource34	post	21.43257092392644	male	White	0.9991776347160339	na	na	na	5	relationships

Because what they do with their money is their decision. I also pay for all my own shit and it might even be to my benefit if all my relationships (family and friends included) were like this. Cuts out any hurt feelings that comes with “keeping count”. In general it’s good policy to not have to worry about who paid for what and this cuts that out by default.

"So my fiancé (25M) & I (24F) used to text all the time and was very excited about each-other of course. Even if he does text me now, I am still eager to respond. Both of us have had job changes, but I know that he currently loves his job and everything about it. 

For the last few months he hasn’t been texting me unless it’s something important, or a question. We see each other every weekend and in between sometimes as well due to jobs, but other than that, we don’t talk much if we aren’t hanging out. 

For example, he used to send good morning and good night texts. Now, I get zero…unless we are texting about something random (not very often) and one of us finally says that we’re going to bed. So none of that out of the blue. I send him texts the most, and he will just forget to look at them or respond to them. He’s always on his phone though, watching Instagram reels and YouTube videos. He always has his phone in his hand. 

He will call me for a bit before I go to work, but we don’t really talk on the phone because he is either drifting off to sleep, hanging up the call to go eat with his parents, or watching Instagram reels. Occasionally we will get a meaningful conversation out of it. Right when that phone hangs up, I usually don’t hear anything from him until the next day when he calls me before work. 

I guess what I’m asking is, is this behavior normal? Is he just extremely low maintenance? He says he’s not big into texting, but he definitely used to be at the beginning of our relationship. 

Any advice?? 

TL;DR: Fiancé & I used to text all the time for the first year of dating. Now, he only calls me before I go to work and we don’t get much meaningful conversation out of it. I won’t hear from him until the next day until he calls me again before work. I’ll text him every once in a while, but he rarely responds instantly and sometimes even forgets to look at them. Maybe he is just not big into texting, but this is like extreme zero texting at all. Advice?"	ThrowRAcookiejar	post	29.0262830211393	female	White	0.9994698166847229	na	na	na	2	relationships
"Is it normal? For the typical guy in his 20s, absolutely it's normal. Texting more often at the beginning of a relationship is also normal, as you get to know each other better there's less personal mystery between individuals, and so topics of conversation need to evolve into more stimulating territory for the rate of conversation to be maintained.

What kind of things do you guys typically talk about? Do you share any common intellectual interests? Books, movies, art, games? Music, politics, technology, cooking, travel? What about just random memes (or reels) to laugh at? Send him a video on insta of a cool location and say ""we should go here"". These are just random ideas, but the thought process is to create bids for interesting conversation. 

If you find he isn't really engaging with your bids for conversation, you'll have to decide how important that type of conversation is to you. If he's sitting on his phone all the time even when he's with you, there's also a chance that he's just comfortable and complacent in the relationship, and at that point there's nothing you can really do except dump him... or just find meaning in other places of your life, and be ok with the current levels of texting (which is totally valid). If he's complacent, one thing is absolutely certain, the texting is not going to get any better once you're married and living together."

"Secret account in case someone I know sees this.

Me (23 F)  and my ex (28 F) were together for about a year and things were going great until suddenly she started to get a little more distant. She claimed she was getting like that with everyone so at first I suspected she was cheating until I found out she was actually telling the truth (yes, I was being a little stalker to find that out).

She finally decided to have a long conversation with me about why she's been like this and it turns out she just feels like she needs to focus on her future. I totally understand that, hurts she has to end things with me for it but what really gets me is this:

She talks to me every single day. She still sends me good morning texts, still makes time for me a few times a week, still acts the same as when we were together (minus saying or doing anything sexual). When we talk, she still wants to know all about my day, what I'm doing and lately, if I started seeing anybody new. 

Of course, like an idiot i tried making her think we could still work because I really do want her to also focus on her future but i felt like I was being desperate so I quit that. Then I tried giving her space but she would contact me and I'm not the type to ignore or leave someone on read. Still, she is always the one to contact me first everyday.

It got to a point I just asked her a bunch of questions and found out she still likes me but doesn't want a relationship with anyone right now. I think I could understand this better if I knew why she suddenly decided this and if it's really true, why is she giving me more attention now than in the last month or so of our relationship?

I’m my experience, anytime someone told me they needed to work on themself, focus on the future, and anything like that… it turned out they wanted to be able to talk to and see other people without having a guilty conscience. If I am correct, I’m sure there’s people that are prospects now but once something progresses with one of them, her behavior and efforts towards you are going to change. I would do yourself a favor and break contact. What point does it serve for you to still be holding onto the possibility that it will work out when she made the decision she didn’t want to be with you.

"Hi Reddit, I have a dilemma. I (23f) have been with my boyfriend (26m) for almost three years. For the first year it was pretty good. I caught him cheated by texting one of his ex’s. He has been distant since that. He hasn’t went out of his way to do something romantic without me calling him out for it, nor does he remember big events or cares about it. We moved in together last year and it hasn’t been good, he cheated on me again. He has been consistently ignoring me and my needs but expects his to be filled. His mother treats me poorly and expects me to cater my whole life towards him. I decided a few weeks ago to move out and I did. 
I did something not great and I downloaded a dating app, thinking that we were over because he didn’t talk to me for three days. Not necessarily to meet anyone but to just talk because I’ve been lonely for two years. I ended up hitting it off with one guy and we have been on a few dates. He’s genuinely really nice. Well. My boyfriend found out and was upset. He told me that he will be romantic and will change and go to therapy to make sure I’m taken care of. The thing is he has been telling me for years he will improve. I feel like he’s doing it as a last ditch effort to keep me and then he will not follow through on his promise. 
I care a lot about the guy on the dating app and my boyfriend. I’m stuck in between a rock and a hard place. I don’t want to string either along. I feel like an awful person for not knowing what I want. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation to this? If so how did you decide. I’m worried I’m going to choose wrong and ruin everything.

"TL;DR: My (17M) GF (16F) says that my affection to her seems to be just me ""doing chores"" and is not genuine just because ""she feels like so"". 

I am currently writing this in a state of mental exhaustion, so please bear with me here and ask any clarifying questions if you need to. I'll be happily replying to every request.  
  
Context: I am 17 years old (17M), and my girlfriend is 16 years old (16F). We have been together for 3 months, and we have had very nasty arguments in the past, but also lots of very sweet moments before. I would say that me and her are all madly in love with each other. Recently, she has been relatively cold and indifferent to me and my questions about her well-being. Yesterday and this morning (where I live), we got into some petty arguments. This happened in the afternoon.  
  
We were sitting in Google Meet and studying together, and I felt unwell from the refluxes that the stress from previous arguments caused me, so I went and took some medicine. Seeing so, she asked me ""what's wrong"" and I replied ""I have acid reflux from stress"". She asked me ""is it because of me"" and I said ""partly, but I want to resolve this later with you"". Here's where the serious part begins.  
  
I explained why I was getting stressed - because I was already stressing out over my future major, and that her coldness and indifference to my care burdened me even more.  
  
She explained her view - was that she saw my care as ""doing chores"" and was not genuine - therefore, she was indifferent towards my affection. I was very hurt by this, as I have always cared for her genuinely, have always been there for her when she needed me and went out of my way to prepare her surprise gifts (letters, paper flowers and chocolate) on anniversaries. She also mentioned that she wasn't doing too well on her part, as her period was starting. After that, she apologized for stressing me out.  
  
Being very distressed by such a comment, I started talking about my efforts to care for her (such as downloading hundreds of Pinterest images just to add some spice to our chats, spent time to note down her interests and hobbies, and the aforementioned gifts). I assumed that she was viewing my care as ""chores"" because I greeted her (often with very similar sentences) and initiated conversations at fixed periods in the day (after waking up, after finishing lunch, before sleeping...). I also pointed out that when I was physically tired (such as after 4 hours' worth of tutoring time), I still made the effort to ask about her well-being. She said that she felt that it was ""chores"" just because ""she felt like so"". Then, because my dinner was coming up, I said goodbye, and reassured her that I still had hopes that we could get through this together, and that I loved her dearly. We left Google Meet, and I still messaged her some reassuring and cute images to calm her mind.  
  
After about an hour of silence or so, she messaged me sweetly, saying that she loves me and she is sorry for things. I was still really unwell (mentally), so I responded negatively, saying something like this  
  
""Of course, I would still hug you and make you flowers, but whether or not you feel warm, and find those flowers beautiful, is unknown to me"".  
  
She said that ""I respect your efforts and am grateful for it, please do not talk as if I have betrayed you.""  
  
I asked her that ""If you respect my efforts, then how come you see them as 'chores'?"" She answered by saying that she has already answered (which probably refers to her answer of ""felt like so"" previously mentioned) and that it depends on me whether or not I find it convincing. I ended the conversation, and asked for a few hours of silence. We still said ""I love you"" to each other.  
  
I am incredibly distressed at this moment and I do not know what to do to resolve this situation. We cannot meet each other physically (right now), so it's even more difficult. I believe that she still loves me, and I know that I still love her.

TL;DR: My (17M) GF (16F) says that my affection to her seems to be just me ""doing chores"" and is not genuine just because ""she feels like so"". I feel betrayed, as well as confused.

"Saying that 'she has already answered and you have to believe her answer, or not' is an attempt to draw a boundary -- and not an unreasonable one -- on how much responsibility she is willing to take for your anxiety and your fixating. That was what you hear when someone feels they are being manipulated and bullied and blamed for things that exist only inside your head. They are telling you that they have given up, because nothing they say is going to change what you've decided to believe. You had decided to believe nasty things about her, and she'd given up trying to argue with you. 

She is correct to demand some respect, and not to have everything she says interpreted in the worst possible light.

You don't need to fine-tune. You need to stop.

You need to stop blaming someone else because you are putting forth more effort than you want to in the relationship. You need to ownership of your own choices, and change them if they are not working for you, or for the relationship.

You do need to stop expecting perfect communication from a 16-year-old. If cannot extend her some more trust and benefit of the doubt than you did here, then do not date her.

>Is this line of reasoning flawed in any way?

Not flawed exactly but definitely unhealthy. The first part anyway. The part about having genuine interest in her day and sharing yours is sweet. 

But the part about sacrificing to the routine to avoid fights that sap your energy is *really* not good. That is not how relationships are meant to be. 

If you are fighting this much in the first few months is a really bad sign. In the beginnings of relationships people are usually on their very best behavior. If it's devolving into you needing to walk on eggshells to prevent fights, you should just break up. This relationship doesn't sound good for either of you."

"> She explained her view - was that she saw my care as ""doing chores"" and was not genuine - therefore, she was indifferent towards my affection.

Acts of Service (I'm guessing) is one of your love languages. But it isn't one of hers. So while you're showing her just how much you care about her (by doing those chores), they happen to be par for the course - they don't convey anything in particular for her, unfortunately.

What is her love language, if you had to guess?

> I was very hurt by this, as I have always cared for her genuinely, have always been there for her when she needed me and went out of my way to prepare her surprise gifts (letters, paper flowers and chocolate) on anniversaries.

My love language happens to be gift giving. Unfortunately my partner's isn't. Doing those aforementioned things would convey a meaningful sense of love *to me*. However, doing those same things for my partner isn't particularly meaningful to *him*. He doesn't *mind* those things, but they don't stand out to him as being especially loving and important.

Has your girlfriend mentioned if (you doing) those things means something to her? If she thinks of those things as being special?

> ""Of course, I would still hug you and make you flowers, but whether or not you feel warm, and find those flowers beautiful, is unknown to me"".

She said that ""I respect your efforts and am grateful for it, please do not talk as if I have betrayed you.""

OP, I noticed you wrote English isn't your native language and in fact you have had to use a translation to communicate this to an English audience (Reddit). That dialogue seems a little strange to me - is that actually how you two speak, or convey thoughts to each other?

You tell her (in your native language) that you have no idea if flowers are conveying affection for you, and in return, she replies that she recognizes your efforts and doesn't understand why you would feel hurt (doubt her acknowledgement about your affection)?

I'm confused as to how you two communicate clearly."	Proof-Coast7778	reply	na	na	na	0.9964112639427185	no	no	no	na	relationships
I’m not saying that she’s always going to be like this.  Some people change, others don’t.  Right now, what you see as putting in effort, she sees as “the absolute bare minimum”.  The problem you’ll likely see is that the more effort you put in, the more her expectations of “the bare minimum” will climb.  The harder you work to gain her approval, the more you’ll see that her appreciation is only fleeting, and that becomes the new minimum of expectations.  The anxiety you get from this may be because you feel like you are putting way more effort into this than you get in return from her.  The lesson she may be taking from it is that the less approval she gives, the harder you work to earn it.  It sounds like you’re focusing too much on her approval and not enough on building the sort of relationship that makes you both happy.

"last year, i had class with this guy i thought was cute. eventually i found out that he knew my friend and i asked her to give me his instagram. after he gave me his number we started talking a month after that, we got into a relationship that lasted 3 months. 
 
however in january i found out that i had to switch schools to get extra credits, that being already stressful enough i didnt think that could be any worse until my ex was lagging on me the whole day. i was leaving the gym when i got the breakup message.

at first i was confused as to why he broke up with me since i thought i was being the best girlfriend i could be, and i constantly asked his friends to tell my ex to text me. but he told them no and said that i had hurt him alot, and they also told me he was also calling me names and saying that i was accusing him of grape as a joke to his friends. however during that time of the relationship i always started arguments with him whenever i felt like he was not responding to me on purpose or sleeping without saying goodnight, even posting stuff on my cf on instagram shaming him as well as reposting stuff on my tiktok “relating” to girls with “bad boyfriends” and comparing our relationship with others. which i know is so idiotic and toxic of me.
 
i went to therapy and talked it out and found out that a lot of my trauma and abandonment issues caused my behavior and reactions towards him. its been over half a year and now that im back at my old school, i cant help but want to text him and apologize for everything (and ive been thinking this for a long time and contemplating). we had both made mistake since it was both of our first relationships and never talked anything out. i really do want to message him and apologize for everything ive done, and i hope that doesnt sound selfish because he doesnt need to give me anything in return. but im stuck and dont know what to do or say.
 
TL;DR- i was a very toxic person with a lot of trauma, and didnt realize how badly i hurt my ex until now. and i want to apologize but dont know how."	_mangogreentea	post	15.442867037259298	male	White	0.9891235828399658	na	na	na	2	relationships
You leave him alone and move on. Sometimes we have to deal with the fact we may be the bad guy in someone’s story and they don’t owe it to you to listen to what you have to say to ease your guilty feelings. He doesn’t want to speak to you and specifically told everyone around him not to let you contact him. Disrespecting his wishes is not the way to apologize.

"It looks like you're still processing all of this even though it happened a while ago.

It won't do any harm in contacting him AS LONG AS you keep it cool and don't expect anything in return (including asking to meet up). It'll help your own internalization if youput all of your feelings into words and at least you've attempted to right your wrongs. Not the same thing but in a lot of help programs making amends with people they've hurt is one of the last steps, for closure and moving forward.

"I’ll try to keep this to just what I think are the main things that made things go so wrong because it’s going to be long

K(nonbinary) had been a part of my friend group for half a year and become pretty good friends before our relationship became romantic, we talked, played games, sleep on call and watch tv shows together almost every day, main downside is we live in different countries, after another another half a year I got into a big shot university in New York, I became too busy to hang out with K as frequently but still had conversations over text every day and things were going fine, I met a woman, S (F18), who is beautiful and intelligent and popular but not into the same geeky stuff as me, we became study partners, this is where it started to go downhill with K

K didn’t like that I started watching ‘our shows’ with S, brought up how they had been waiting the entire semester to finish them with me, K started having nightmares about S bullying them, eventually S started swiping my phone every day and I admit I should have set stricter boundaries because she did start harassing them and a couple of my girl best friends, I assured K that she has a boyfriend and would never be interested in someone as unattractive as me, S said that she wasn’t sorry for it but I let her know if she did it again I wouldn’t let her see my phone again and she apologised to me, K didn’t want to forgive her and claimed I had no right to accept the apology on their behalf.

When I confessed to K that S cheated on her ex with her new boyfriend and doesn’t actually like him, and let K know that S had admitted she has a crush on me afterall they and our friends expected me to cut her off, after months of S continuing to provoke K I agreed, when I told S I’m not allowed to be her friend anymore it upset her and she promised to stop, I told K that S is a good person, that she’s useful when it comes to academics and it’s in my best interest to keep her in my life for my career, K was mad at me as well now

K had problems with so many things I was doing with S, I even got scolded for having playlists with her because the songs were ‘all about romantic relationships’ at this point K was doing nothing but stressing me out and I had to be comforted by SOMEONE, they even started stalking S online and claiming her VSCO posts were about them, I’m not sure what K told our friends but they all seem repulsed by me now

I spent months trying to prove that I’m willing to work on our relationship and make things up to K, I even talked to their best friend and admitted that S’s behaviour could be called abusive but in 7 months nothing was working as long as S was in my life, K’s mental and physical health had become terrible by now but at this point S had become in charge of important clubs and would surely sabotage my career if I didn’t stay friendly with her, K let me know that me validating S’s behaviour towards them was also emotional abuse, while K was at a cosplay convention I called and told them I wasn’t going to see S again, I blocked her, I was going to spend as much time with them as possible as soon as my semester ended, that we can talk about everything wrong as much as needed and that we would get through this together. 

Before my semester was over I blocked K and unblocked S because they continued stalking her and asked me why she was still posting photos of me, I told them I was no longer willing to make things up to them and they asked if we could at least still talk for closure, I agreed, that was months ago now and when the time came that we were supposed to talk and I didn’t unblock them they told my best friend everything that happened.. I unblocked K briefly to tell them to stop stalking S and we haven’t spoken since

Now guilt from this situation is setting in, I can’t help but think I took things for granted, how do I be a good person in this situation? K kept telling me I needed to do the right thing, that my morals are what’s wrong with me, I barley associate with the woman who harassed them anymore, it wasn’t worth it, It’s probably not even appropriate to unblock K at this point

TL;DR I tolerated my partner’s ‘bully’ for a year and called them a stalker for worrying about it, is there anything I can do to atone?"	throwawayacc87776	post	25.451360899763333	female	White	0.998694121837616	na	na	na	1	relationships

"I don't like either side of the people that I've encountered in my life and they won't leave me alone

One side is extremely selfish, controlling, persistent, self-righteous, privileged, condescending, and ultimately -- a bunch of insensitive assholes with a woman that abandoned me / gave me away at the age of 8 and ruined my life for eternity that's leading the helm and they're now 1) trying to  force me into a relationship that I don't want and 2) to be in communication with everyone -- which I also don't want

&#x200B;

Whereas the other side is basically a devil in a new dress (functioning abusive alcoholic and narcissist husband, narcissistic physically and and psychologically abusive wife, with a pedophile daughter that attempted to groom me over the years and is dating someone that made harmful and false accusations against me)

Note: they basically want to shift the paradigm so that I'm forced to associate with the woman and her family and I'm not interested in her or her family or anyone in connection to these people

That alone is pretty traumatic for a child let alone someone that is a grown adult that already experienced more than enough and it feels like they're not considering my own needs and just continue to desperately persist without backing off

&#x200B;

I don't want to ever communicate with either side and we're all trapped in the same area - besides legal action....I desperately want to get away from everyone and permanently cut off contact

I also never desired to be part of a family or live the lifestyle that they're trying to force including long-term or permanent relationships with individuals - it's just very confining and controlling for me and makes me feel like I can't breathe yet they continue to persist rather than accepting that I'm clearly not interested

TLDR: I read a text exchange between my wife and her best friend in which she wrote that she was in love with another friend. Now I’m wondering what to do.

English is not my first language so excuse any mistakes.

Me (28M) and my wife (31F) have been married for a year. We met in a dating app, dated for two years and got married last summer. It’s the best relationship I have ever had. My wife is funny, kind and very intelligent (a MD!). She and I have similar interests and views on life and politics. We are both huge nerds, and enjoy playing table top games and RPG. I felt really lucky for finding her and for her to be interested in me.

We never really fight, just have calm discussions when they are needed. She is not the most affectionate physically, but loves buying gifts for me and for others, and spending time together. I’m very satisfied with our sex life as well. I don’t have anything to complain about.

Or rather, I didn’t until this Sunday. She was baking some muffins from a recipe her friend gave her and asked me to look for a detail on her text exchange with her friend. I think she forgot about the conversation she had with another friend in the same app, because when I opened I could read the beginning of a message stating “I don’t regret never telling Dave (31?M, fake name) that I lo…”. 

Dave is a long time friend of her. I didn’t say anything, but I was really curious about this conversation. It’s not on of my proudest moments, but I waited for her to fall asleep and read the whole message thread later.

Basically they were talking about a crush her friend (F) had in another man they know (not really relevant to my history). She was wondering if she should say something because she wasn’t unsure if she should risk the friendship.

My wife told her she was in love with Dave since they were 16, but never told him anything because she cherished their friendship too much. Her friend asked her if her feelings for Dave changed after marrying me and she answered and I quote here the exact message “No, and after 15 years, I don’t think they will, but I rather have him as friend in my life forever. Marriages end easier than friendships”.

This devastated me. I don’t even know what to think. It just feel like she loves him more than me. Like our relationship is something she thought worth the risk, but theirs was too precious even for this. Like he is the most important man in her like when it should be me, her husband.

I know Dave, he is a very nice guy, but it’s not remarkable in any way (even precociously balding). They meet like every two months when she goes back to her hometown to visit her mum. Some times I go with her. I never suspected anything, she doesn’t behave differently with him than any of  her other friends. She has a lot of different friend groups from different cities she lived, so travelling to meeting a friend it’s not unusual to her. I read all the messages they exchanged and it’s just memes and funny moments from their days. 

My head is just a mess. I wish it was me that she loved for so long. But then again she would not be in a romantic relationship with me if that was the case. I love her so much and I thought she loved me too. She says she loves me, but now I just don’t know. 

Should I confront her about this? Should I just forget everything (she married me in the end, not him)? I feel ashamed for snooping on her phone, I wish I never read anything.

"“But I rather have him as a friend in my life forever. Marriages end easier than friendships.” 

This is the part that I would have the biggest issue with. It seems like if mark jeopardizes the friendship by confessing his love for her that she would choose him without a second thought. I’d also be worried that her feelings for mark “overwhelm” her in the future or you guys have a low point in your marriage and it tips the scale for her to be willing to risk her friendship with him for a chance at a romantic one. 

I don’t know if this is a deal breaker for you or not but it would raise some major concerns about the future for me. I’m sure she loves you but it seems like she is saying she is settling for you at the same time. I don’t know just doesn’t feel right. But every marriage has its ups and downs. I’d communicate your discomfort and ask for an explanation. Then go from there.

Ask her what the message means to her, while explaining your own feelings about it.

"""Marriages end easier than friendships”

Yep.  Personally this is _absolute_ bullshit.  I would put far more effort into my marriage, and preserving it, then a friendship as my marriage means more, by far, then any friendship.  I'm, not saying I would easily give up of  a good friendship - just that it's a distinct tier below my marriage.  

Honestly it comes across to me that OP is a distinct tier below the friendship.  Honestly I think she would likely chose the friend if there was an ultimatum which is appropriate when you love someone else (in a non-plutonic way).

"1. About this relationship - My boyfriend (25M) and I (26F) have been in a long distance relationship for almost 3 years, and have seen each other in person for a couple of times, including a trip abroad together. Before this happened, we even talked about going to his country to visit his family in this December. Also I have been planning on moving to his country and living together next year (to do another degree, which is not entirely for him, but the destination is at least partially because of him). To be honest I believe that the relationship is no longer that passionate as it used to be at the beginning, however we still agreed on that we love each other and want to spend the rest of our life with each other, and both parties have been working on this goal.

2. About ourselves - he and I would both describe myself as a considerate, persistent person, but also needy, easily to get anxious and insecure, and tend to be aggressive when having a fight ; and as to him, honest, kind of nerdy, likes to play video games, most of the time shows care for me and gives me a lot of security, including texting whenever he has time, and having a call throughout the night.

3. About the previous issues - In general I trust him and believe he will never cheat on me. We have had a couple of big fights so far, and he wanted to break up last year before we met for the first time, because he felt this relationship didn't work anymore. He said (1) I focused too much on him and he wanted me to have my own life but not just him; (2) he felt I don't really love him, but rather someone I want him to be, and I tried to turn him into that kind of person.  I quite understand his first point, and I also don't want my love to become a burden on him. However for now I live a quite boring life. Apart from time for work and friends, I have been spending all my spare time on either preparing for applying degrees, or time with him, probably leads to why he feels overwhelmed. Regarding the second point, I actually never meant to do this. I think it is normal in a relationship to change/improve myself a little bit to adopt my partner, but it should never be interpreted like that. So after every fight he always asks me to leave him alone for a while. During this period we still text (I usually take the initiative and express my feelings for him) each other from time to time, but this usually lasts a week or so. And when he feels okay again, he comes back.

4. About the issue leading to this break - So before this break I still thought there was no possibility for us to be apart, although I have to admit that at the moment this relationship can barely give both of us happiness. Everything was okay until he went on a trip with his friends to another country. I didn't know how many friends there were, so initially I thought there were only 3 (2 males and 1 female, who is a friend of over 8 years but never met in person before, and it turned out that there were actually 7 in this tour). He disappeared one entire night, without any text. So I got extremely anxious about that, as this never happened before, I quite worried if something bad happened to him. He got back the next day, saying don't worry he was fine, nothing happened but just because they did a lot of swimming, sauna, so not really much time to look at his phone. After this one-week trip he also mentioned that he only charged his phone twice. 

I know I should trust him, but still my emotions got rather intense, and I feel anxiety. I asked him some questions that even I think crazy and toxic, like with whom did you have dinner, who you were texting just now, why your last seen time always shows 1 minute later after you replied me.. I know I'm being rather twitchy and I have been trying to calm myself down. I explained to him about how this anxiety comes from, hoped for his understanding. He did try to comfort me, I believe. However due to this anxiety, I urged him to think about where we are going this December, even though he told me that he didn't really want to do this today, after an exhausting week, and he could do it some day next week.

5. About this break - We still texted each other a lot before this break, and agreed to have a call in the evening. After he finally got back home, he told me that ""I really want to play XYZ today again"". I was irritated because he promised to have a call. So I didn't reply and hoped that he would call me afterwards. After an hour or so he wrote ""you don't text me babe"". And I went ""what am I supposed to say? You ignored that I'm unhappy and just leave me crying alone."" Then he said ""Look to be honest, I don't feel like it's working anymore, for so long it all was just feeling like a chore to stop you from being sad, mad, disappointed or insecure. I don't want to but the alternative seems no good either. I've been trying to make it work still for your sake because I know how hard it would be on you, but I feel like I've been fighting a losing battle for so long."" He said for him the pain was just like ripping off a bandaid, still he loves me but he doesn't feel it working. I was literally on the edge of emotional breakdown so I called him and told him I don't want to break up with him. We talked about a lot of things, and he said, I still love you, but not the way I used to. Finally he said we can just take a break and see if life will be better without each other. But he's not sure how long it will take, could be one month or longer, and if he will decide to get back together after the break. 

I feel completely heartbroken, because I never imagined this could happen, as last time we also had a fight and he said he didn't think of breaking up. I don't know if it's just my reaction triggering this, or he's actually been thinking about this for a while, and his feelings for me have gone for good. I really love him, and do not want to lose him in my life, although I clearly know the relationship has been unhealthy for a while, but I am still trying to fix my emotional instability, and I still believe that the happiness takes up most in our relationship. I'd still like to save this relationship, but I'm not really sure what to do, and if this break is just a softer breakup, because he doesn't want to hurt me too much.

TL;DR: My boyfriend of almost 3 years said he needs a break but not sure how long it will be. I still want to save the relationship as I don't think it has come to the end, but what should I do?"	Lucreziaaa	post	19.379755735286594	female	White	0.004668434150516987	na	na	na	6	relationships

"hey there, i'm sorry all of this is happening and i wish both of you all the strength and support you need!!

i think it *is* over between you two. he said that he has felt like it is a chore *for a while* and that he *has been thinking about this*, so it doesn't sound like it was just something said in the spur of a moment.

if i was in your shoes, i would give myself (and him) a week or so of letting it sink in what just happened. and then i'd ask to have a conversation about how to proceed with this break up; answering questjons like if you will still occasionally text each other or if maybe no contact would be less painful

from personal experience, i have had a super painful break up once, also long distance, that ended not because of any betrayal but just because we didn't love each other like that anymore and it became a chore in hindsight. we were so close (and also somewhat co-dependant, which made the break up worse) and promised to stay best friends, but i said i need a few days or weeks of no contact in order to calm down first. once i felt like i could approach my ex again without breaking into tears immediately, we talked about how we are doing, what's new with our families or current job and school thingies going on, and that we are glad that we are still talking to each other. but then neither of us really initiated a conversation often anymore and we went without texting for two or three months i believe. and one day, i dont remember who of us it was, but one of us texted the other one to check if everything is going fine again, and to apologize for going quiet and not texting anymore, but it turned out we both were glad to not text each other anymore. we had found other things to occupy our time (and other people too respectively) and it was like a relief to find out that those feelings of 'setting ourselfs free' by not forcing ourself to text for the sake of texting were mutual. so we managed to depart on good terms, somewhat sweet terms even, making the best out of what i believe is always a painful situation, to break up or be broken up with

i hope that you too will find peace like this soon too, i really hope so. it will take time and the first weeks i was crying all the time, but it will be okay. time really does make it easier. it would only be more painful to keep trying to be together when it is evidently not going to work, but if your ex and you are both willing to do so you can be able to find a way to have a 'nice' break up with those occasional talks to make sure everything is okay. just don't give yourself false hope that after the break you will go back to how things were before - accepting that it is over is difficult, but it also brings beautiful new opportunities. it was fun rediscovering who i am, just by myself, not seeing myself as a duo with my ex, and to just in general have more time to devote to playing games, reading, drawing, ... whatever it is that you enjoy doing! and of course, though I don't know if that matters to you at this point, there will be plenty new people to meet in your future! both romantically and platonically. it might feel like you'll never love like you love him again, but life is beautiful and there are so many connections to make with other people that will light you up with joy and love, again, both platonically and romantically.

"I really appreciate your answer, thank you so much! I still have some sort of hope that this was just out of his anger as I was blaming him for bailing on me, because from my perspective everything was in general ok and we haven't had a fight for a long time.  I even asked him about if he thinks our relationship has entered a rather stable phase, and he said yes he does believe so. Also he told me that he loved me everyday, and kept sharing his life with me. So he describing this as a chore is really a shock to me, because if he did all those stuff just to try to comfort me and meanwhile was thinking that way all the time, it's really horrible.

Anyway I will give both of us a one-week break and then ask him if this is really a break and he just needs some time and space, or it has been meant to be a no turnaround breakup since he brought it up. If it's the latter, I will try to move on, although it's going to be extremely tough for me.

"i'm glad to be able to help a bit!!

and i don't think it necessary would be 'really horrible' that he had had these feelings for a while. i think it more likely that he did and does love you and cares for you, just not enough to justify being in this relationship anymore. maybe describing it as 'a chore' was only a recent realization and before that he just felt somewhat off but couldn't put it into words? of maybe he hoped to help you find more of a safety net before he breaks the news as to not devastate you as much. or maybe he was trying to figure out himself if this was just a 'phase' or if he really felt differently about you and the relationship now. maybe he was scared to admit to it until this confrontation boiled it all up. there are so many ways he could have perceived and processed all of this, and they are much more likely than him having purposefully deceived you and told you lies or something.

"My wife and I have been married for 10 years, a couple for 15, and friends for about 18 years. My wife is demisexual, while I am demiromantic and asexual. For most of my life, I have been entirely sex-repulsed, but somewhat slowly, I've begun fancying the idea of stimulating my wife with my fingers - but I am still completely repulsed by other sex acts. 

My wife has always been completely supportive and respectful of me and my repulsion regarding sex. I know that if I ever wanted to have sex, she would love to, but she is always incredibly kind and supportive and tells me that she loves me as I am, even without sex. I admit that at times, I feel quite upset that I am so uncomfortable with sex, I wish my thoughts and feelings about it were more favourable. I should also note that whenever asked, she has told me that she has absolutely no desire to have sex with anyone else. 

Around last Christmas, I was talking to my brother, and he asked me if I would ever let my wife have sex with other men if she wanted. My immediate response was ""no,"" and he said that was unfair of me, but I told him that she does not want that, so I didn't want to discuss it. 

My thoughts about that question sort of festered. The fact that love is so deeply intertwined with my wife's desire for sex heightens my extreme distaste for the idea of her sleeping with anyone else, but I do feel a bit guilty for my reaction because I can't give that to her. I've taken comfort in the fact that she doesn't want to sleep with anyone else, but this question I think has sparked some things. 

A little after my brother asked this, I started thinking more and more about sexual activity with (i.e. fingering) my wife, and at the same time I've begun feeling more and more possessive of her. I know that I shouldn't and that those feelings are bad, but for the past few months I've found myself disliking the idea of people flirting with her or expressing too strong interest in her much more than before. I trust her completely, so I feel even more guilty about feeling this way. 

Furthermore, I've found myself more tempted to do things that feel like invading her privacy - like checking in with what she's doing and where she is more than I would before, touching her dirty clothes, and being more touchy with her when in public together. 

I know these feelings are bad, and I know I need to curb them, but how do I do that? Are these things just what comes with sexual feelings? Is this just me worrying over a question my brother asked that is, realistically, about something that would never happen? I just want to be the best husband I can, my wife means the world to me. She's my soulmate, I want to be an entirely positive presence in her life, not one with weird feelings that feel wrong. 

TL;DR: I've begun having more possessive feelings about my wife, and I want to know how to manage them. "	ChloeDancerTemple	post	23.103553133201803	male	White	0.0035041177179664373	na	na	na	24	relationships
I think some therapy might be really well placed. It could make a big difference to you both.especially if you're starting to feel these feelings of interest you haven't before they could be extended possibly? A sex positive therapist or maybe touch and intimacy based might be a great thing for physical intimacy and release some of your discomfort.

"hi! I'm so sorry you're struggling with your feelings on this. I have to disclaim that I am in no way ace, so do take that into account with my advice. 

it's completely normal, human, and valid to feel some jealousy at the thought of your spouse being sexual with someone else - no matter whether you're on the ace spectrum or not. this isn't a bad thing, you don't need to beat yourself up about it, and you don't need to expend all your energy trying to 'curb' it. 

*feeling* an emotion is not a problem. *allowing your emotions to influence your actions without any filter in between* **is** a problem, but you're not doing that, so you're fine for now. 

also, TALK to her about these feelings you're having! she is the best person to discuss this with. my guess is that she will reassure you that there's nothing to worry about.   


>I've found myself more tempted to do things that feel like invading her privacy - like checking in with what she's doing and where she is more than I would before, touching her dirty clothes, and being more touchy with her when in public together.

however - I'm not sure if this is a cultural thing, but I have to admit I was really taken aback by this, and I'd love some more info from you.

where I'm from, a reasonable amount of checking in on your spouse and what they're up to during the day, touching their dirty clothes (??), and being touchy to a certain level (holding hands, linking arms to walk together, hugging, a quick kiss on the cheek/mouth) are all considered absolutely normal and would not constitute an invasion of privacy. 

my husband will often text me in the middle of a work day to say he's thinking about me, and asks me how my day has been/what I'm doing, and it's really sweet and lovely to know that he's thinking about me and cares about my day. or on the weekend if either of us are away or out and about, we often text to check in with each other. 

I'm curious, what is it about those things that you feel constitutes an invasion of privacy?"	ChloeDancerTemple	reply	na	na	na	0.0035041177179664373	strong	no	no	na	relationships

"Well, it's more like the degree and underlying feelings of those acts make them feel like invasions of privacy. 

I've always enjoyed texting her and checking in with her throughout the day because I love her and am interested in her life and what she's doing. But now, I've noticed that the frequency is increasing, and I feel the need to ask her more about not only her feelings and tell her mine, but to know more logistical things and details about events and not just her feelings about it. It just feels close to being controlling, and I don't want that. 

While touching her dirty clothes feels okay if I'm doing the laundry (or picking up something off the floor to put in the laundry), I've started taking some of her things from the laundry and just touching them to touch them. I don't know, it just makes me feel like a pervert and like I'm nasty.

There's certainly a level of touchiness that I've always loved with her in public, but I feel the need to do it more and to greater degrees (e.g., keep my arm around her when we sit together in public when I'd normally just hold her hand, or kiss her on the lips in front of other people when usually I'd give her one on the cheek or forehead), and the need to hover over her more in public, I guess. It just feels invasive. 

I've talked to her a bit and she's reassured me, but admittedly I'm just worried about my thoughts and feelings. I don't want this to mean something bad, and I'm scared it does, but I don't want to burden her with that.

">Well, it's more like the degree and underlying feelings of those acts make them feel like invasions of privacy.

so it seems to me that it's more a reflection of you feeling guilt about your intentions, rather than the acts themselves. remember that distinction going forward, it'll help.

this seems like a pretty extreme reaction to dirty laundry in my opinion - dirty laundry isn't inherently sexual in any way. I'm an allo person with a high sex drive and I had to *really* do some thought gymnastics to try and find a pathway from sorting my husband's dirty laundry to anything that approaches sexual. and honestly, I really can't find anything sexual or nasty about having to pick up his dirty socks and t-shirts! stay with me on this -    


>I'm just worried about my thoughts and feelings. I don't want this to mean something bad, and I'm scared it does, but I don't want to burden her with that.

related to my previous point: while it's a good thing to be self-analytical in regards to one's emotions, especially when it comes to relationships, in my opinion, you're overthinking this catastrophically. 

you're not a bad guy and you've done nothing wrong at all, so the fact that you're demonising yourself to this extent tells me that there's something going on that needs to be addressed. 

I think seeing a good sex-positive therapist (one who is educated about ace spectrum folks) would help you contextualise everything and gain some distance and perspective about the situation."	ChloeDancerTemple	reply	na	na	na	0.0035041177179664373	weak	no	no	na	relationships

"  
Hello, I'm asking this since I'm (15f) in highschool and have wanted a partner for a long time. (I'm kind of a hopeless romantic) since there are so many people in highschool, I know it should be easier, but I'm not sure if I count as ""attractive"". I know that it's all preference, but I always see these pretty girls with big breasts, big hips, and a tiny waist. I know that stereotypes and media is stupid, but it's what's hot. I'm pretty far from the ""pretty girl"" thing. Yes, I got larger breasts and hips, but I also have a bit of a tummy (it's apparently not from being ""fat"", I think it's a part of the body type) and thunder thighs. I'm also quite short than what's considered an attractive height (I'm quite literally not  an inch over five foot) and there are types. I dunno when this started, or why, but I seem to like the more soft, quiet, more feminine like boys (again, dunno when or how it started) but I've never actually met any, since all of my junior high classmate boys were those annoying dudes that basically think their the best since they work out at the gym. Why is it that all ""pretty"" dudes seem to always be gay? (Yeah, that was unrelated, but still) I know I shouldn't be picky and stuff, so I try to keep an open mind. Can somebody give me advice in this? (,Oh yeah, another problem is I don't have the courage to ask anyone out, so maybe some tips on that would help as well. Thank you!)

He has worked for this company since January and got a great offer. He has struggled to keep up with work sometimes and has clashed with his boss a couple of times due to him forgetting things, but it always sounded very mild.  
  
Apparently, his boss gave him a stern talking to today and said they will be monitoring how much he gets done daily from now on. He came home and broke up with me because he thinks he is going to be fired within the week. He works from home 2-3 days a week and I know he plays video games during work sometimes during those days, but he always made it sound like he was getting his work done.  
  
I love him and I am very worried about him for obvious reasons. If he loses the job he will have to move home due to rent costs and student loan payments, not to mention the toll on his mental health. I said I wanted to stay together during that (his parents live 1.5 hours away and we visit them every two weeks ). I even offered to pay both our rent for a little, but he insisted that ""it's over"" despite saying he loves me, and that we will find a sublet to take over his portion of the rent.  
  
I asked if he was self-sabotaging because he tends to go scorched earth with things. He hasn't lost his job yet, and while he is on severe probation, he can still work to fix things. He said he wasn't self-sabotaging, and that he just wanted to give up.  
  
I'm really not sure how to help in this situation. I tried comforting and he pushed me away, he won't hug me, doesn't want to discuss it, and won't sleep in the same bedroom as me. We have ""broken up"" during fights before and discussed the root issue, it's never been like this, it's always been ""we have different goals and this might be the right call"" not ""I'm not dragging you down, it's over.""  


Is there a good way for me to support his right now? Should I try to start moving on and accept the breakup? I apologize for the long post, thanks for reading.

TL;DR - My(22F) boyfriend(23M) of 3 years broke up with me because he thinks he is going to lose his job. Can I support him during this difficult time? Should I try to start moving on and accept the breakup?"	ME_BA	post	33.321041447395075	male	White	0.9984115362167358	na	na	na	4	relationships
">he has always been more of an average acheiver...he lets himself enjoy life

Even people who ""enjoy life"" have to meet their responsibilities. 

>He has struggled to keep up with work sometimes  
>  
>He works from home 2-3 days a week and I know he plays video games during work sometimes during those days

Your boyfriend is failing to meet the basic threshold of ""doing his job"". A job isn't something you do for pocket money, it's exchanging your time/expertise/skills/labour for money. If your boyfriend isn't holding up his end of the bargain, why should an employee keep him on their payroll?

It's probably worse than you think as well. ""He made it sound like he was getting his work done,"" ""he made the forgetting sound mild."" 

I think your boyfriend is self-sabotaging - it sounds like he wants to give up on adult responsibilities like having a job, having a live-in girlfriend, and paying rent. He wants to go back to living like a teenager, living at his parents house and free to game at his leisure. 

I don't think there's much you can do. If you love and respect him, you need to assume that he means what he says when he says ""I want to break up with you."" Even if he is self-sabotaging, even if he lives to regret this decision, you need to take him at his word, not say, ""No, no, you don't mean that, I know best."" 

If he wants to break up with you, the only answer you can give is. ""Okay."" Then take your own time to heal."	ME_BA	reply	na	na	na	0.9984115362167358	no	strong	no	na	relationships
"Maybe give him a little while to realize he is being dumb. Probably shouldn't jump into dating right after a breakup anyway. He might feel like a failure and unworthy. He might feel like he should end things if he has to move back home. He is really jumping the gun though. Instead of blowing up a relationship he should just start applying and get a new job. This won't be the last time work goes to shit or his boss gets mad about something.

There is a chance he simply can't get over whatever caused him to feel like he had to break up. That or he has other reasons and just wanted to use this as an excuse. If he takes too long to get his head straight then you'd have to move on.

Some people get a bit wrapped up in their own head or something and end relationships when life goes bad unrelated to the relationship. Not sure if they plan to file for divorce everytime they have problems at work or something upsetting happens. Like it makes sense to maybe not start something new if you have things going on but I'm not sure blowing up a relationship over the suggestion of maybe getting fired is a sound strategy."

To start with the fact that he would choose anything over you is a big red flag, when you truly love someone that means you will make any and all sacrifices to insure their safety and well being on top of making sure you don't do anything to hurt them or put them through any unnecessary pain or anguish, and you will put them first before yourself at all costs, take you for instance even when He has hurt you after braking up with you and treating you in a way of disrespect by outing you as if you don't mean what he has made you believe you do to him after 3 years of your own sacrifices and support, you are still asking for advice on how to help him in his time of needing support for (His) lack of responsibility and disrespecting you. Even if he doesn't know your worth please for your sake and your own peace of mind always be aware of who you are in life and what difference your existence makes in this world because you are absolutely worthy of being loved and wanted and respected in your life, relationship, and more importantly in you own home.

That's highly unusual to break up often during fights.

I do agree that he is self-sabatoging.  

He wants to break up but hasn't been able to take himself away from the relationship.  It sounds toxic given the BU dynamic.

I would find it demoralizing and destabilizing to be in a relationship where fights are not fought to find a compromise but instead the nuclear button of breakup is pushed often.

Via previous fights, you have discovered that you have different goals and you both don't communicate very well.

He sounds depressed as well as who wouldn't be being stuck in a relationship that is going nowhere.

Let the man go.

I know it hurts but you admit yourself that you aren't compatible longterm.

"Tl;dr i need help asap prolly cause of my situation with my gf.

I ( 18 Male) have known a girl (18 Female)  for a year and two months and have been dating her for eight and a half months. We were in situationship and had been flirting for first 6 months and after that i proposed and we started dating. But when we started dating, she met this guy at a trip with her friends in a park and asked for his insta and then she cheated on me with him (not physically niether did she ever went on dates with him but she was emotionally attached to him and flirted a bit) and i got to know about all this after 4 months of being in relationship and she did admit to all this but all this hurt my ego. I swore i would never stay with a cheater but i loved her so much that i decided to stay with her but this caused alot of drama and arguements among us. She did blocked him after 1 month of talking cause i told her to. We had been having arguments for 3 months and it was very hectic and stressful. Everytime i talked to her i had this thought that she is a cheater and she'll do it again anytime she gets to. She swears she has changed. But i just couldn't fight the thought and finally i decided to leave her and had been trying to leave her for a month and finally i made a lousy excuse and left her on 19th july, i didn't had any other girl i could talk to or just another person to talk to cuz my friends were busy in their life and i couldn't tell parents or siblings. So, i felt the most loneliest i could at that point. And then after constant feeling of missing her, i finally texted her on 21st july to patch up and she did agree but she had unblocked that guy again. That made me regret my decision but she blocked him again. And after that i did somethings which i thougjt I'd never do. I'm in cybersecurity and know a little bit of it. So, i hacked into her Instagram account and she knows i can hack so she had deleted all the chats but i unblocked and texted the guy to send screenshots of the conversation they had after unblocking on a account which i made as fake account of her and blocked him again from original account. And he texted there but he was very uncooperative and blocked again but i did got a few screenshots out of him and they included her saying ""i knew this relationship wasnt gonna work and i had lost feelings for him longggg back"" and that made me not wanna stay with her even more. But i ignored and thought she might have changed and then i was on video call with her to listen to music the previous day but instead of talking or anything she was just on her phone texting someone constantly and ignoring me. Now im curious and i wanna hack her discord now. I never wanted to be this but she turned me into this. Love is difficult. I hate the thought of her cheating on me again or being with someone else. I just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading."	CALABRASS	post	21.00738687971792	male	White	0.995962917804718	na	na	na	1	relationships

"Earlier this year in January I met this woman who was basically everything I ever dreamed I wanted in someone. The conversations we had, the way she looks, our sexual chemistry, the activities we did... Inseparable for 3 months, we did everything and it was amazing.

  
Sadly she ended it over the phone when I travelled because we come from different religious backgrounds (where I live it affects how people get married, I know it's stupid) and there is a considerable age gap between us, her reasoning was that we are falling in love with each other for something that will never materialize in marriage so we should end it now to spare further hurt later on. Ok, I agreed, even though it hurt me a lot.

  
The point here is not whether we should have been together or whether the reason she gave me is real or she just didn't want me, I don't care about that. My question and confusion is why I am not able to stop thinking about her 4 months later.

  
I've been going out with other women, keeping myself busy with work and my side job and going out with friends, I keep myself really busy (which is my life anyway), but I can't stop thinking about her, can't stop listening to songs that remind me of her, every time I see a romance on TV I find myself crying because I miss her so much. 

  
How is it possible? It's only a 3 months relationship, and I've been in LONG relationships before, some spanning years, I have been married a long time ago and have had my share of ups and downs in different relationships, long-term or short. But this one, I am not able to get over, and I thought I would be okay after this much time, but I am not... I don't understand why... 

Tldr: Date a girl for 3 months and she broke up with me, but now, 4 months later, I still think about her and I don't understand why. "	SergioFX	post	16.465262513592666	female	White	0.9894583225250244	na	na	na	1	relationships
"I mean, there are many possible reasons. 

Sometimes, a short relationship is harder to get over than a longer one because the honeymoon phase is so much more intense than what comes afterwards. Basically a hormonal thing.

Still being in the honeymoon phase also means that you don't know the other person well enough to know their flaws yet. It's still so new that both people are on their best behavior - hence you saying she ""was all [you] ever dreamt of"". You not knowing her flaws yet and her still being a ""dream woman"" means that getting over someone ""perfect"" is harder than about the partner of ten years where you knew all their little flaws which annoyed you so much.

Third, it seems like your breakup was basically caused by an external reason (your culture). That makes it a lot harder and so, I disagree that the reason she gave you is not important. I think it's pretty vital. There being an exteral reason for the breakup that neither of you can help means that the emotional connection of you two was never damaged. She didn't do anything wrong that made you fall out of love with her, so that makes getting over her harder. It's more like when someone dies - that's also external and we grieve the deceased a lot more than we would grieve someone who tells us that they think we suck and don't want to hang out anymore."

"Hello all, I know that this has been a long time coming but after everything recently it’s pushed me over the edge. We have been together for 3 years, and through that time the only thing we have ever fought over is money/freedom. I have a business and work part time bartending to afford my random weekends away and my nice apartment, while he has had the same low paying job our entire relationship. This past year I have encouraged him to get a new job that pays better and he decided to sink his savings into a new phone sales business, and work full time at his low paying job. That is, until, he moved in and decided to quit his job the second day living here. He has been door dashing since then but I can’t help but feel like we are on completely different pages of what we want right now. I want security, to explore the word with the money I make, and to be loved. While he wants to simply get by. Looking back on the relationship I realized he’s never taken me on a date that he planned and payed for, he’s never bought me flowers, he’s never planned anything for my birthday, he’s simply here. I work from home and now that he’s unemployed and home constantly it’s getting on my last nerves. I can’t be here with him and get any work done. I know this is the end. I know I need to grow up and move on but I don’t know how now that he’s living with me. I don’t want to kick him home to his parents but I don’t think he could afford anything else right now. I thought we could fix things and I explained why I have some anxieties regarding the whole “move in with me and quit job” situation and he just said it makes him feel bad to think about and money isn’t everything. I’m over it. He needs to grow up and I’m tired of waiting around. I don’t want to randomly spring it on him and sleep in separate bedrooms but I need to set myself free.

"I am 35 (F). My partner (33 M) of 2 years has Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. We met online and he was upfront about his condition and how it affects him before our first date. His condition affects his physical appearance because he has a scoliosis (i.e. spinal curve) and claw hands (i.e. his hands are skeletal and his fingers are curved). He walks normally with the help of splints which he wears under his trousers (and which are therefore not noticeable although he still chose to tell me about this before our first meeting).  
  
None of the above has ever put me off. One of my favourite things about my partner back then was how open and honest he was about his condition. He allowed me to ask questions and he always offered me answers when he had them. I thought that showed tremendous confidence on his part and, from my end, made it easier for me to proceed with my eyes wide open. For example, my partner and I both want children but I personally would not be able to knowingly ""roll the dice"" with something like that. So, early on we agreed to undergo genetic testing if things got serious. We have already done this - the results were that our biological children would not inherit my partner's disability and we have just as much chance of a ""normal pregnancy"" as any other seemingly ""normal"" couple would. Our choice to undergo genetic testing is a deeply personal one - different couples will choose different paths and that's their prerogative. I only bring it up to demonstrate how my partner and I have never shied away from serious conversations about his condition, nor have I ever failed to appreciate it for what it is. My partner and I are both educated with good jobs. I've read medical articles on his condition and even attended his annual check ups with him so I could ask his personal physicians any questions I have (my partner's suggestion). My partner's condition has been stable since early childhood, but because it's so rare and the disease is so variable from one person to the next, I know that could one day change. Or it could not. His health, like everyone else's, is unpredictable. But unlike many people, myself included, he knows what his health challenges are and has spent his life staying on top of them as best as he can.  
  
My partner is my soulmate and we complement each other perfectly. I am the ying to his yang and we play off each other's personalities like something out of a romcom. When we're out in public it's not unusual for strangers to comment positively on us as a couple. My partner has met my friends and colleagues, all of whom love him and say that we are made for each other. I have met his family, friends and colleagues, all of whom have given the same feedback on me.  
  
The only exception - and reason for this post - is my father. My father is my only living relative and he is in his 80s. I lost my two siblings in an accident when I was a teenager, and my mother passed away from cancer when I was 31. I have no extended relatives. My father recently met my partner and, to put things mildly, it did not go well. My father vehemently opposes my relationship with my partner. He says I ""must be desperate to be with somebody like that"" and that he will never approve. He has been carrying on with me and begging me to end things with my partner. I've told him to stop it but he says he will never stop ""loving and protecting \[me\] from \[myself\]"".  
  
I love my father and despite our many differences, I know he loves me too. I can appreciate that he's probably concerned about what will happen to me if my partner's condition gets worse as we get older. I am driven and career-oriented, so I can see why he might worry about this. I've tried to explain to my father that there is nothing to indicate that my partner's condition is getting worse as he's been aging, and that the likelihood of his health taking a turn is the same as it is for anyone else's. I've used the example of my mother - my father's much younger wife who unexpectedly got diagnosed with terminal cancer despite outwardly being the picture of health - and my father became enraged accusing me of disrespecting my mother's memory. He says I am inevitably going to end up sacrificing my career to become a carer to my partner and that our relationship will be the biggest mistake I've ever made. He has also begged me not to have children with my partner because ""the doctors might be wrong"".  
  
I really don't know what to do. My partner and I are planning on getting married next year and I will be crushed if my father - the only family member I have - does not come to the wedding. My partner and I have already started thinking of names for our future family and it kills me inside to think that family won't include our future children's grandpa. I also know that because of my dad's age his time is limited, and I don't want him to die with things being the way they are between us. For this reason my partner encourages me to keep trying with my dad. My partner is my future but in terms of my past, my dad's all I've got and - whether he appreciates it or not - I'm all he has.  
  
TL;DR!: My father does not approve of my disabled partner because of his disability. Has anyone else ever been in a similar situation where your parent(s) did not approve of your partner for whatever reason? How did you handle it? Do you have any advice on how I can keep trying with my dad?

"I agree with what you are seeing - that your father does, in some way, come from a place of concern, but that the way he is going about it is absolutely horrible. And I agree with the other commenters that you need to shield your partner from his comments, to the point that you should consider if you want your father at your wedding if you think that there is a possibility of him causing drama. 

However.

I do think that maybe, there might be a way forward with your father. *Maybe*. Maybe he is just too set in his ways at his old age, but it doesn't hurt to try. The comment you made about your mother clearly set him off - and I think you should examine *why*. 

Sure, her death wasn't that long ago, but I suspect that your father carries complicated feelings and possible trauma. He lost his beloved wife when he, with likely absolute certainty, never dreamt about her dying before he would. Your mother and your father likely discussed things in great detail when they got together as well - about what to do when your father would get too old to care for himself, what sort of caretaking he was (not) expecting from your mother, how their relationship would happen if he couldn't give her the physical affection anymore she would still desire...

In a way, your father and mother were in a similiar spot to you and your partner, given the age difference you spoke about, with your father being the one who would require care of his much younger partner one day. The one destined to ""hold her back"". And then she was the one who died first. 

I suspect that there are a lot of conflicting feelings in your father. Maybe he feels guilty that your mother spent her lifetime with an ""old man"". Maybe he just comes from a place of empathy - that he doesn't ever want you to go through what he went through when it comes to losing a partner. Maybe it's the other way round - maybe he, too, has health issues in his age and he saw how that affected your mother before she got ill, when he couldn't give her anymore what she needed and he sees that in your future as well. 

Please note that none of that excuses the way he is handling matters. But it might be a way to reconnect with him. Sit down with your father and talk to him not about your relationship with your partner, but his relationship with your mother. Ask him about his grief. Ask him about their marriage. Ask him if he ever regretted marrying her, despite the fact that she died and left him behind. Ask him if he regretted caring for her when she fell ill. Try to see how he felt and feels and where he is drawing the similiarities from he is warning you about. 

As someone who lost her mother almost two years ago, I can tell you that it was only after her death that I really talked with my father about their marriage and how it really was. In the end, most (good) parents *always* try to keep problems away from their kids, even if the kids are grown adults, because it's never right to drag the children into the conflicts and struggles between parents. Now that your mother is gone, your father may be willing to open up more about his feelings and how he experienced the marriage. Try to reconnect with him through that.

And if he tells you that your mother had never any regrets marrying him despite the fact that he would likely die before her and she would care for him and that he, too, never regretted marrying her despite him having to watch her die and leaving him behind, then maybe approach him from that angle - that this is how you feel about your partner, too. Don't argue about probabilities and what the doctors said. The probability that your mother, whom you described as a ""picture of health"" would die before your dad also wasn't high and yet it happened. It's understandable that he doesn't believe in probabilities anymore. Approach him where he emotionally is. 

And if he expresses that he wishes he wouldn't have married your mother in any way or form, then understand that this is what he is telling you - ""don't make the same mistake I made, don't have the same regrets"". In that case, you may have to accept that he is too deep in his guilt and misery to see that your decisions are still your own and things don't have to play out badly for you and your partner. But if it becomes obvious that this is why he is acting the way he is, then at least you can maybe make some more peace with his reasoning, painful as it may be.

"Ironic that the guy who rolled the dice by having a kid at \~50 years old is begging you not to have children because the ""doctors might be wrong.""

Your father is not thinking rationally here.  He won't accept your rational explanations of the probabilities and risks.  His opinions are rooted in pure emotional reaction.  Giving him the utmost benefit of the doubt, it's fear of you being heartbroken and left alone, like he was.  I think more likely (since he won't listen to your solid medical evidence), it's an embarrassment at his daughter ""settling"" for someone who doesn't appear ""normal.""

But regardless, further rational talk won't help.  You need to meet him where he is.  Have you ever firmly said something like, ""Dad, I understand that this isn't who you pictured me marrying and I understand your concern about the risks.  I've done everything I can, such as genetic testing and talking to doctors, to minimize the risks.  But I'm not going into this blind.  I am willfully choosing this person to be my husband, even if we might not have a 'normal' future.  I'm asking you to accept my choice and decide what role you'd like to play in my life and marriage going forward.  Do you want to still visit with me but we don't speak any further about my fiance/husband?  Do you want to be in both of our lives?  Do you want to be at my wedding?

">I can appreciate that he's probably concerned about what will happen to me if my partner's condition gets worse as we get older.

Stop rationalizing his ableism. That is all it is. You know full well that his ""concern"" is unfounded, and why can't he respect and believe what you know or look it up or ask an expert questions himself? What's stopping him from asking your partner questions (and thus treating your partner like a person who knows his own medical condition better than he does)? Why is him deciding that your partner is more disabled than he is and will definitely become more disabled and that would mean your life would definitely be ruined without listening to you or asking questions reasonable?

>I don't want him to die with things being the way they are between us.

Recognize that the way things are between you is on him. He is choosing to ruin your relationship by being ignorant and hateful. He's being patronizing to you, too.

You sound like a wonderful person, and your relationship with your partner sounds amazing. Why choose to put a damper on it just because you're biologically related to only one person now?

Why is DNA so important in your relationship that you're allowing it to outweigh your father's actions and behaviors and how they make you feel?

If your father were physically beating you, would you say ""but he's the only biological family we have left""? ""His time is limited""? If your partner were Black and he was being racist instead of ableist, would you say his concerns that you might have dark-skinned children were reasonable?

You said it yourself, your young mother was diagnosed with cancer. You have the benefit of having done genetic testing so you know as much as anyone can know. You could be hit by a drunk driver tomorrow and need a carer for the rest of your life. Nobody's guaranteed health. The disabled are the only minority anyone can join in the blink of an eye.

YOU know that your father is being unreasonable. Stop making excuses for him just because he gave you half his genetic code and he's the only one left living in your family tree. Those are not good reasons to maintain a relationship.

Does it suck when family fails you? Absolutely. You're fortunate that you and your partner have great friends and colleagues, and you have your partner's family.

You can tell your father that you've heard his concerns but that he needs to get on board and respect your choices if he wants to remain in your life and hopefully meet his grandchildren before he dies."	JollyJamJar	reply	na	na	na	0.0012078138533979654	weak	no	no	na	relationships

You are right about their age gap being something they considered early on in their relationship. I was raised with the understanding that I should cherish the moments I had with my dad because he might not be at my graduation, wedding etc due to his age. I know my mom's family had misgivings about their marriage because of my dad's age and this caused a massive rift between him and her parents.   


I am going to bring this up with my dad and invite him to talk to me openly and honestly about my mother as his wife, not just my mom. Like you've said, I need to approach him where he is emotionally and - if nothing else - reconnect with him from a place of empathy.

"23F) recently got into a relationship with my boyfriend (22M). This is both of our first relationships, have been together for over 2 months now, and things are going very well. I love him very much and have no problem expressing this to him. 

But, the problem is talking about it with other people. It's very hard for me to say that I'm in a relationship or have a boyfriend. I have no idea what it is or if this is a normal feeling for a first relationship. I get very shy and embarrassed about it, and have a hard time talking about it in real life. Whenever he says he loves me, I become very embarrassed as well.. I can't look him in the eye when he says it, but I'm not scared about it, just very very embarrassed. I get very red very easily as well

Is there a way to get over this? Is this normal or okay for a first relationship?

Maybe a shift in perspective may help . Honestly when it comes down to it, who cares what other people think or have to say about you or you relationship. You should be happy that there is someone out here in this cruel world that loves you and isn’t afraid to tell you. Ima tell you from experience, enjoy every moment you have with people who treat you well and tell you they love you . We all are hoping to find our forever person . But not everyone’s definition of “forever” are the same . So instead of being shy when confronted with love by anyone …. Be grateful , look your bf in the eyes and let him know that you see him! In more ways than one . If you don’t, you’ll let opportunities of happiness slip you by. And that’s a fact. Always remember. If you have someone that tells you they love you.. and they mean it by showing you … ; you are one of the lucky ones! :))	AmityAmp	reply	na	na	na	0.9978392720222473	weak	no	no	na	relationships

My partner(F) and I (M) have been together for several years. 5 of which long distance and two have been in person.

Since arriving in person things have been going great and we have really bonded very well. However about a year ago she told me she doesn’t like I say certain things.

Examples being using the word ‘okay’ to mean yes or an agreement with something. This is due to her extensive history of sarcastic family ties and friends that belittled her. Another example being that I may not use a very gentle and calming tone when talking, this makes her feel scared that I am being like her abusive father.

Now to clarify, I love this women more than I could put into words and I am trying my hardest to be the way she wants me to be. But deep down I am feeling like I am being held to an unreasonably high standard and it’s an impossible task to change the person I am.

I am very gentle and kind to her on all instances and I adore her. I don’t speak ill of her, I never raise my voice in anger, I also try to mediate any disagreement and argument as best as possible. However I feel like she doesn’t see that I try very hard to be loving and caring despite being told off and threatened with break ups over how I word things.

I love this woman very much but I am struggling to come to terms with what to do. I am still trying to remember everything that can ‘trigger’ her (to use her own words) but that isn’t good enough for her. It’s been one year now since she told me about it and I slip up maybe 1% of the time - nonetheless a slip up means an argument.

I want things to be the way they used to be, I could speak openly and freely with her - I could be myself and she would accept me wholly. However I feel like I have to change myself to be with her and that’s not healthy.


Please let me know if anyone else has a partner or ex that shared this issue :)

"I'd say if such things are so triggering to her, it sounds like it's also something she should be working on as well. It sounds like, I assume anyway, unless she is exaggerating or using this as an excuse to, I don't know control you in some way, which is unlikely/uncommon, that she's experienced some relational trauma causing her to be triggered by certain tones or words resulting in physiological distress, etc., or basically a trauma response. If so, then that's of no fault of her own or anything, and it's something that does become physiologically ingrained especially if the experiences happened earlier in life, but it's something that needs to be worked on in therapy/with treatment, etc., because it's impossible to go about life insisting that everyone/everything, even those closest to you, be aware of anything and everything that might trigger you, and to adjust things so that they don't get triggered. It's not possible, simply, but also it's harmful to her in the long run, because there's no way for her to avoid these triggers (for example, using the word ""okay"", it'd be really difficult to automatically react to such a common/widely used phrase), causing continued suffering for her, and a lot of problems at work, etc., as a result. Again, it's not her fault, and it sucks - I have OCD btw, and there are a lot of triggers, but, while definitely your SO, or whoever's closest to you, should be understanding, supportive,  empathetic, it's something that she (and I) have to do our own work on because it's not good or fair for us, but not fair for those around us either."

"Confused

Confused

There is a girl(23f) that I work with and was a close friend and i(27m) was attracted to but we have been distant since she cut me out of her life and said we can only be coworkers going foward and things can’t go back to how they were. She’s in a serious relationship and I feel I always respected it and didn’t cross boundaries. Things went south when I told her I was proud of her, I said it as a friend to friend. Shortly after this she became stand offish, and tried to figure out why. We have barley spoken in the 2 years since but the last few days she’s kinda been nicer than what’s been a no contact type thing, I asked her for help with some prep and she had no hesitation to help , I’ve avoided asking her in the past because I just don’t want to talk to her, I still believe she’s a amazing cook and have a lot of respect for her and I always relied on her in the past, she seems to be willing to help knowing how busy I’m about to get when she has the time. I appreciate this , but there’s this to. She parked next to me the following day and maybe I’m thinking to far into it but she stopped parking near me for awhile and she when we’re on good terms teased me about parking next to her . Maybe I’m reading to much into this but I just can’t seem to shrug it off. I still care for her and stuff, like I would drop everything to help her or if she called. I miss what we use to have even tho it wasn’t a relationship but a friendship. I’m so confused…if any of you females could give me some insight into this I would appreciate it.

"TL;DR

I (28/F), met a guy (30/M) on a dating app. Found out a few weeks after our first date that he just officially broke up with his gf of 1 year , 2 days prior the date. Fast forward to almost 2 months of dating, he still follows his ex gf on his socials (which I don't mind) but, finds him ranting to me how he feels like some of the tweets of his ex gf is about him telling people why they broke up. Also, they were cohabitating their whole relationship and he's still paying for the rent of their space where the ex gf still lives in. Now, I'm confused if I'm just being used as a rebound or if he's just not used to being single. More context: He's been in a 13-year relationship and had 2 beautiful kids which he's, as expected, is supporting (cool with me). His next relationship after that was his 1year recent ex gf which he said treated him like a sugar daddy but made up to him by being sweet and clingy (which I think is his love language). 
I'm in my era of self love where I love spending my time in solitude. Staying at home and chilling to music, movies, food, good workout. I  know to myself that I like him but, there's this feeling I can't shake off that gives me ideas to break up with him cause I feel like hasn't had a space to trully heal before I started dating him. Lastly, our lifestyle's are polar opposites. He's used to living in luxury while I like living a simple private life. Sorry for the long post. I'm just lost right now."

"My friend and I met online and have strictly known each other online. She has a pretty bad home life and some mental health issues that have plagued her life and made it difficult for her to simply live. Recently, I moved to another country, and during my time abroad I suffered a pretty hard rejection by a woman I really wanted to get to know better. I struggled with my feelings of that for a year, which I get is a long time.

During a lot of that time I leaned on my friend way too hard about what I was going through, and it got to a point where we stopped talking to each other for three months, and then she reached out to me to continue our friendship and I stopped asking her for support for the things I'm dealing with. Knowing that she already deals with a lot in her own life, I realized I got way out of line talking so much about that rejection with her. So I recognize that and I'm no longer trying to ask her for emotional support anymore.

The thing is, the issues I've dealt with regarding dating and relationships and whatnot have been a fundamental part of my life that has shaped who I am as a person. I like to write, so naturally a lot of my writing is influenced by these things. She knows this is all a big part of who I am as a person. I've listened to a lot of discourse and philosophies and stuff regarding living life and dating and the related sociological issues regarding that. It's just something that I think about a lot.

I just had an idea for a poem and I was curious to know what she thought about it because it felt like the metaphor I was thinking of using would seem kinda cringe from a woman's perspective and I simply wanted to know what she thought. So first of all, before I can even tell her anything, she starts immediately bringing up something else in a videogame we both play, and we talked about that for a bit instead. When we had nothing left to say about it, I told her about my poem and instead of really commenting on it, she responds by saying ""Boohoo I'm a man I'm so misunderstood!"" and then we had a pretty big fight about talking about these things.

She told me that she does not have the capacity to think about these issues and it's like, I fully get that. I know she is dealing with a lot of shit at home and mentally as well. However, I wasn't trying to have a deep or heavy discussion at all. I was just trying to ask if a creative idea I had sounded dumb, and even if she was just like Yeah dude that idea sounds really fucking dumb, I would roll my eyes, or whatever, I wouldn't have minded. But she didn't do that, she basically mocked my issues, brought up her own personal issues and also her general problems tied with being a woman and I know those are legitimate experiences that I recognize and I had no intention of drawing any comparison to them. Again, I wasn't even trying to have a deep conversation about my problems or societal issues or anything. I just wanted to know if something I was writing sounded cringe.

This is just one example. I feel like this happens every time I bring up anything even remotely related to something similar. And I've listened to her when she would tell me when she is going through something. I've never dismissed what she feels or told her not to bother talking to me about things because I'm going through my own shit in life. She also talks a LOT about this one game we both play, and it's like, I'm not always in the mood to talk about it but I listen anyway because I know that she talks about it because she doesn't want to think about other things in her life when she's talking about it, and I don't ask her to change the subject or anything because of that. But sometimes I just don't have much to say because we talk so much about the same game that I just kind of have exhausted a lot of my opinions about it.

I'm not really sure what to do. This is my closest friend I trust more than anyone to talk to about deeply personal things in my life. Especially because right now, a lot of my more immediate friends are mutuals with the woman who rejected me and I do not feel very comfortable being as personal with them about the things I'm going through. And there was a time my friend was very respectful and understanding about me and the things I'm going through, but these days she gets inflamed really easily any time I bring up things that are important to me and she ends up making snarky retorts and responding to my concern about our friendship with simply ""lmfao"" when I try to explain how her dismissal of things makes me feel.

Is this it? Is she only ever going to be a person I talk about surface level topics with from now on? I don't know what to do about our friendship anymore.

-----------------------------

tl;dr: My friend has a lot of personal and mental health issues and we used to be really close and trusting and understanding of each other, but after I recently leaned on her too much for emotional support over a bad rejection I experienced, we didn't talk for a few months and then we rekindled our friendship and I stopped asking for any kind of emotional support. However, whenever I bring up anything even remotely related to issues that are important to me, she dismisses everything and reacts very disrespectful to me. When I point it out she usually just responds with ""lol."" One recent example is I tried to ask if an idea I had for a poem sounded cringe, and instead of even commenting about it she straight up mocked my issues and I wasn't even trying to have a deep conversation or ask for emotional support again. I'm not sure what to do about this because she is my closest friend I trust more than anyone rn."	cheetahblades	post	26.062099682880756	male	White	0.998052716255188	na	na	na	1	relationships
Have you tried opening up to her about your feelings and how her being emotionally unavailable affects you. Everyone is entitled to their feelings and a good friends offers support and understanding. If it's a case where you feel it unfair or she is always gaslighting your feelings, no offense but you are long distant friends, cut the tie. Sounds like her negativity may be creating negativity in you. And from reading everything, seems like you've been there for her but when it comes time for her to reciprocate, she just doesn't take your feeling seriously.  Try to talk about this in a healthy adult way. If she puts you down, is rude, says anything unsupportive,  then I would strongly suggest you think about ehat I said and whether they are really a friend or not.	cheetahblades	reply	na	na	na	0.998052716255188	weak	no	strong	na	relationships

I even saw messages of him stating he didn't want to be with me multiple times, that he won't leave because he feels guilty and doesn't know how to leave me, even ones saying that he hates my son (from a previous relationship) It seems the only reason things ended is because she flipped out on him and she stopped talking to him/went no contact (this was maybe 2 years ago she said). I really believe if he had the chance to be with her in any way again he would. We've had our ups and downs (he's cheated before) but I just feel so stupid to have believed him about this one person.

Break lease, split all assets, get your own apartment, get some friends to help you move out. My opinion is that the cheater gets to pay the fees to break lease, so if that’s 3 months rent, he’s paying the additional 3 months rent and you aren’t helping him.

"**You are not stupid.** 

Trusting someone isn't an act of intelligence or the lack of it, and him manipulating you into trusting him doesn't mean he is smart and you are dumb, it means you wanted a sincere and trusting adult romantic relationship - and he took advantage of it and used it against you.

You need to end it now. Today if you can. Get him out of the house (work, night out with his buddies, etc..) and get the locks changed. Or move in with a friend or family if he owns the place... you have to end it now. Not just for you, but for your son. It this guy hates your child, you need to recognize that and to get him as far away from him as possible. 

You don't have a lot of time either his ex-mistress isn't just going to tell you. She's going to tell the world and SOON he will hear that you know... so you want to make the first move.

from the child perspective….my mom left my father for similar mistakes when i was a baby because she knew that’s what would be best for us. it was just the two of us until i was 19 and she re married. this doesn’t make my father a terrible person as he has made big mistakes as does any human but that doesn’t mean there won’t be consequences. i am grown now and have a great relationship with both of them, and successful on my own. i think my life would be very different (in a negative way) if she hadn’t left. similar story - my aunt (moms sister) married a man when her daughter from previous marriage was 6 years old (which is my cousin). my cousin BEGGED her mother not to marry him, and almost refused to be in the wedding day of. he hated her and she knew it. they stayed together, had a child together, and she is miserable (my aunt). he’s cheated on her, doesn’t appreciate her, undervalues her and is a narcissistic asshole. but my aunt feared she couldn’t give her kids a good life without him. my cousin (21 now) is one of my closest friends and is suffering mentally, and financially, without proper skills to building relationships and how to stay afloat in this world. i often think that these two decisions make an entire difference in mine and her life. my mother didn’t have it “really bad” with my dad, it just wasn’t what was best in the long run. i think once it has gotten to a certain point it always make it harder to leave because you think things like how could get any worse or maybe now this has happened it will change. however in my opinion, you can’t force something that isn’t meant to be, and signs will only turn into more signs meaning it will only get worse, especially if he knows you are depending on him that leaves him in full control. do what is best for you and your kiddo. i’m so sorry your going through this but i promise you and your son will come out stronger	Turbulent_Fill_3630	reply	na	na	na	0.9992967844009399	no	strong	no	na	relationships

Maybe you need to accept that it was never love and to accept that it was over long before you even made it official.

"TLDR- my partners leaving me and I’m devastated. 

My partner and I have been together for 9 years, we have a child who’s 13 (adopted, only mentioning for context). When Covid hit, I didn’t handle the isolation well and was the biggest BEEZY that lasted about 2 years. During that time she said she needed to leave me. When I realized a weight loss medication I was on was fueling my anger, I stopped and that seemed to help. Our relationship recovered but she still wants to leave. If finances weren’t involved, I think she already would have. She’s becoming more and more distant, doesn’t kiss me as much, doesn’t hold hands while driving….

"I’m just gonna cut to the chase: I constantly feel like my male friends don’t really like me. They have never given me a reason to think so, but for some reason I feel like they’re secretly not fans of being in my presence. I feel like I’m a burden, I’m annoying, I don’t do the things they like to do, just to name a few. 

To sum up my early life and how I think it has affected me today regarding this topic: i wasn’t close with my dad, my only brother has been a drug addict since I’ve been old enough to comprehend what’s going on with him, my best friend from high school stopped talking to me when I went to college and never gave me any sort of closure even with my attempts to reach out to him since then just to talk.

It sucks because I just want to hang out with my guy friends and not feel like I’m gonna be judged once I leave the function. I’ve already voiced this a couple of times to my friends individually and even though it helps in the short term, I feel like I just make things worse because I give them more reasons to think I’m annoying or weird or different.

I’ve talked about this in therapy, I’m doing my best to reframe things in my head like “people really don’t spend that much time thinking about you” or “if they didn’t like you they would say something” but yeah, idk, I sometimes have a hard time believing myself when I say that.

"
My ex-boyfriend of 2 years who I lived with broke up with me 7 years ago. It was his apartment technically and I called my parents and brother to let them know what was happening and they manipulated and pretty much forced me into moving back home while he left for the weekend after he dumped me. My dad and stepmom threatened to stop paying for school if I didn’t move and my brother showed up at my door with a truck. I wasn’t even allowed to clean up after myself on my way out as my brother was pressed for time. Also I became extremely depressed living at home and dropped out of school and started binge drinking and doing lots of drugs and eventually had to check into a rehab.

I feel like if I hadn’t moved out things would have been different and it was just such a traumatic part of my life having everything change and losing him and my home so suddenly. He’s married now and I have a baby and a loving partner and my own business but I think about my ex all the time and my heart aches and I sometimes still resent my brother and dad and stepmom for forcing me to leave all those years ago.

I think this is the key point, not your ex.  I'd certainly still resent them too, and probably would have cut them out asap.  What they did was awful.  Even though it sounds like it's turned out all right for you now, having someone else force your life onto a different track like that sucks, and I think it's normal to wonder about ""what ifs"".

"My mom has a lot of siblings the youngest of which decided to become a single mom around age 50. Nothing has been easy beginning with the pregnancy, but the overarching problem is my aunt is focused on all the wrong things when it comes to raising him and relies heavily on the rest of the family to raise him.  Her son was showing some developmental delays as a toddler and was subsequently diagnosed with autism.  when he was around 4-5 things were extremely hard with lockdown - apparently she said they were screaming so much at each other she was scared neighbors would call CPS. 

Now she’s moved closer to the family (largely bc she needs their help parenting so much) and my cousin has acclimated well. He’s a grade or so behind but very smart social and loving to most people except her. We also convinced her to get in him therapy which is helping.  

Here’s the main problem. She adamantly believes his autism is caused by gluten and forces him to adhere to a strict gluten free diet. Also everything has to be organic. She has even promised him he could have a gluten cake in his bday and has revoked that promise on the day of. Not only does he not trust her, I strongly feel he’s developing disordered eating because of it. He hardly eats (understandable since his food tastes terrible), knows wayyy to much about gluten/diet stuff for a kid, and is underweight and weak. She also doesn’t take him to a real doctor and doubtful he’s vaccinated. He has begun to say things like I want to die, I hate myself which is horrifying for a young child. 

In addition, she’s recently let this dead beat guy who didn’t want to commit to her in the past move into her house. He has no job, doesn’t pay rent, and doesn’t help with the son. He just gives her acupuncture and herbal supplements. Recently he turned off the houses electricity in the night because it’s “bad for you”. My aunt has moved their couch away from electronics and refused to stay with my grandma because she has too many electronics. It’s likely this boyfriend is a big cause of her conspiracies and I’m worried this will spiral even further. 

My family has obviously tried to get thru with her on individual issues but the situation is worsening to a very concerning degree. She’s always been a bit emotionally distant and frankly does act like the youngest child. She’s very quick to say you’re all ganging up on me and self isolate. How can my aunts and uncles approach her? She agreed. To do therapy with my other aunt but it hasn’t manifested yet.

"Hi guys. I (23) have been with my bf (23) for about 2 years now. Two of my college friends from 5 years back have been in a band together for a long time. We will call them Kelsey & Matt. I’ve seen them play a few shows and supported them along the way. I had a small fling with Matt a few years back, and considered him a good friend at one point. It was never official, but we did hookup/have sex a handful of times. I took a step away from him when I started dating my current boyfriend, Jake, because I knew Matt had feelings for me, even though I told him they weren’t reciprocated.

Fast forward two years, I’m still with my boyfriend and still friends with Kelsey. A few months ago, Kelsey invited me & my bf to her birthday party at a bowling alley. I didn’t ask my boyfriend to go, because he’s made it clear that he never wants to see Matt, and I assumed he would be there since he’s in the band with Kelsey. I took my cousin with me instead. Matt wasn’t there, but my boyfriend gave me an extremely hard time and was pissed that I went, even though I told him the plan and kept him updated throughout the night. The argument spread out for a few days and he told me how disrespectful it was for me to go, and he went so far as to break up with me, but took it back. 

Fast forward to now. Kelsey and my cousin have feelings for each other, since they had met a few times, not just at her bday party. Kelsey’s band has an upcoming show that both my cousin and I were invited to. We both want to go to show our support to Kelsey, but I knew it would potentially cause issues with my boyfriend. I thought about inviting him, since he said he would have rather gone to the bday party instead of my cousin, just in case Matt was there, HOWEVER, he also told me if he ever saw Matt that he would be a straight up dick to him. So of course, I didn’t invite him. 

Anyway, I asked my boyfriend about going to the show with my cousin and he immediately got upset and told me he would be furious if I went and can’t understand why I would even ask him something like that.

My question is, am I in the wrong for wanting to go and support my friend, knowing I may run into a former ex?  I’ve never cheated on my boyfriend and he knows I’ve always been faithful. It seems immature of him to be holding on to a past experience. This is life. There will always be a possibility I run into a former partner. It feels childish of him, but maybe I’m the problem? Please give me your thoughts!

"He’s afraid of losing you, of feelings reigniting between you and an old hookup, and doesn’t want you to socialise with him at all because of the threat he thinks it poses (in case that’s not obvious)

Its not healthy and shows deep insecurity, but I can’t say I don’t get it.

How much you let his insecurities affect your social life is up to you, of course. He clearly has some growing to do but a fear of losing the person he loves, while ultimately resulting in controlling and insecure behaviour, is perhaps not indicative of being a bad person, as others might suggest. An imperfect partner with some issues to work through, yes.

It would be good to talk about this with him in detail, and try to drill down into the reasoning behind the bad feelings, and not the feelings themselves as they apply to this specific situation. Try to get him to see that his insecurities aren‘t based in reality, but rooted in irrational fear. Obviously you’re not his therapist or his mentor, but if you’re invested in his and your future, then it can’t hurt to use this opportunity to help him to grow into a better partner.

It might be helpful to imagine a role-reversal; that he is going to watch an amateur theatre production (or something) where one of the lead cast members is someone he used to date and who had strong feelings for him, but maybe not. It’s hard to know how we‘d really feel outside of a live-fire exercise, and some people are just more neurotic than others, more prone to jealousy and fear. Maybe you’re a more secure person, who’d not be threatened by your partner hanging out around an old flame.

I have been one such person, however so maybe I can offer some insight. Perhaps I’m empathising too much with your partner, but the way my catastrophizing, overthinking neuroses function has a tendency to distort reality somewhat. So if I allow my paranoid nature to take over for a second:

In your mind (presumably): You’re going to see a friend’s band play some music. In the band is a guy you used to sleep with but have no feelings for anymore. You’re going because your cousin wants to and you want to support her and your friend.

In his mind (possibly): You’re going to see a band play some music. In the band is a guy you used to find attractive enough to sleep with regularly, who was really into you in the past. The ex-lover will be on a stage as one of the most powerful and respected people in the room (he’s like Elvis. He’s like Freddy Mercury) and could potentially seem more attractive than ever. It’s not that he doesn’t trust you, per se, but that he’s worried that old feelings could resurface through no direct action on your part, or that the guy could try to erode the relationship you have and very possibly expose your partner for the weak person he‘s afraid he is. (Insecurity/Anxiety is a real pain like that. It convinces you that you’ve just got people fooled when they like you, that at any moment they could realise their mistake) In his mind, the ”safe” option is that you don’t put yourself in the situation where something that threatens the relationship could conceiviably occur.

Does that make any sense? It’s kind of insane, but its also how neuroses and anxiety works. At least it did for me. I’m just some guy, so maybe I’m waaaay off the mark. But if he’s as good a partner as you say outside of this sort of thing, I imagine he could be a lot like how I was in my last relationship.

Insecurity is shitty for everyone involved, but it is something that can be worked on. But to do so you’ll need to address it at the root: if you only work on individual problems, they’ll just keep resurfacing.

I believe if you loved him and prioritized your relationship you wouldn’t put yourself in a position to make your BF feel this way. Flip the scenario. Even if you were okay with it on his end… you wouldn’t like it. Even if you didn’t care about it, most people in that scenario wouldn’t like it.

Wow, thank you so much for taking the time to write all of this. It’s much appreciated and helpful. What you said makes sense, the fear of losing me or having something rekindle. It just upsets me because we have been together for two years and I have been nothing but loyal and honest to him. He will tell me he’s not insecure until the cows come home, but I think if he was secure in the relationship and with himself, that he wouldn’t mind me going.

Her boyfriend does not have a \*boundary\*. He has a \*rule\*. Getting pretty tired of people totally misusing the concept of boundaries the way you just did, not to be rude to you. Boundaries are about how YOU react to a certain thing, what YOU will do in a certain situation. Rules are how OTHERS are supposed to behave, according to you. And no, I disagree that if there was a gender difference there would be a different answer. If you trust your partner, then you trust them.

It's like one person being okay with being a smoker but the other partner isn't. Yeah, some people are okay with their partner being a smoker or both people smoking, but some people think smokers are a dealbreaker.

In this case, this is a hard line he doesn't like. He doesn't want you around your ex -- it's a reflection of himself. Does he go around his exes? Probably not.

I’m still failing to understand the huge issue. I’m not going to go, because If I do then my bf will break up with me. But it’s just so damn frustrating. I don’t know how many times I can tell my friend a lame excuse as to why I can’t see her band play.

"For a bit of context: The person I(15M) considered my closest friend(15F) ghosted me and with justifiable reason.

If somehow, you're interested in learning more about our dynamics, my last post on my profile is related to this one. I will also explain it here.

Towards the end of our relationship at late June, she told me she was being overwhelmed by the fact that I still tried to suggest a relationship with her. For one, that was her second time telling me that she's not ready yet, and I actually tried this time. But I FUCKING messed up. Oh my lord. I couldn't process my emotions yet when she said that I wasn't in her plans. I took it as a sign of her abandoning me someday, and that triggered my fear of abandonment. Out of fear, I begged her to make more time for me to make up with me losing her. I took some time to adjust myself from losing her, but it wasn't healthy as I developed a resentment against her. Her being the receiving end, I know she was hurt. I know she felt something was off. I knew she was tired.

I know because I have been there before. Over the past 40 days, I have reflected a lot. And I am so sorry for what I did. It was wrong, and now I just want to let her know that I will change. I want to apologize, and I'll let her be. I will always be open to her friendship again, but it's her's to decide now.

BUT! I don't know when's the right time. FOR ONE, if I was in her shoes, I would want me to apologize, too. It's a case of ""the longer it takes, the worse it gets"", but I don't really know anything anymore. From her words and actions, she really cared about me, and she wanted to fight for our friendship, but she realized it was getting toxic. I honestly commend her part, because if it weren't for her, I wouldn't have learned.

I'm paying for the consequences of my actions, and that's okay. Now, I just want to tell her I'm sorry. I want to tell her how much of an anxious asshole I was.

I want to respect her time and comfort. Regarding approaching her, I'm not really sure. My mutual friend told me to go for it. But reddit told me that I should just give her the same treatment.

I'm conflicted. I'm still human, and I want to swallow my pride and apologize. I know I can change, and I really want to have clarity. I want to be a person who I can actually be, and that includes apologizing for every mistake I made to someone I valued.

Any advice, reddit?

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Out of my fear of abandonment, and general codependent issues, I lost my friend. Now, I want to apologize to her and actually LEARN from it, while leaving the decision to her to respect her boundaries and space."

I came here to really ask if it would be crossing boundaries because I don't want to accidentally hurt her again. I want my own peace but thinking of her's too might not align, if you get me.

"My current girlfriend and I are both in our first serious relationship.  It's been a bit rocky, but we love each other very much and have been trying to make it work.

Recently, our fights have gotten worse... a lot worse.  It seems like we right the ship after each argument, only for the next one to devolve into an even worse fight.  Over the past two weeks, I began to realize that we aren't really compatible long-term and have been musing breaking it off.  

We had a blowout fight over the phone last Thursday over some really innocuous shit, and the fight trickled into calls on Friday and calls on Sunday.  Tonight, a separate issue came up, and it feels (at least, right now at 3 AM) like the straw that broke the camel's back.  As much as I love her and care about her, and as much as I know a breakup will ruin her, it seems like a needed course of action.

**HOWEVER**, her life is really fucked right now: her grandmother passed away last Wednesday and she was stuck spending her birthday in mourning, she's been struggling with our elongated fight over the past few days, and she has her belated birthday party this Friday that she's stressing about (in part due to us being on thin ice).  I blew up at her a bit tonight, so I'm sure she's even more emotional/upset than normal.  She's flying back Thursday, and I won't see her until around midnight.

Again, I know we need to break up, but I don't want to hurt her unnecessarily.  My question is: should I wait to break up with her until next week, when she's a little more settled?  Or is it better to break up with her on Thursday instead of spending the weekend being with her and celebrating (probably) having sex? 

Additional context: we are supposed to ""wrap up"" our fight in person on Thursday and talk about the future of our relationship, so while she's expecting a serious talk, a break up would certainly be surprising.  I'm going to be at a friend's engagement party Thursday night prior to seeing her, so it feels disrespectful to go straight from a party (during which, she'll be waiting in her apartment alone) to her place at 12 AM and break up with her after not seeing her for the past week.

**TL;DR**: I need to break up with my girlfriend, but she's having a really rough time and my only opportunity to break up with her is late at night on Thursday (which will be the first time I'm seeing her in person all week).

Go for the usual wrapping up fight conversation on Thursday no matter how late after the party. Maybe you both will have a heart to heart and figure things out.

"There's no opportune time to break up with someone. Yes, it's going to hurt her. It's not going to hurt less if she finds out (and she probably will) that you waited a week. 

I don't think there's a right answer here, just that you're not going to find a time where she isn't hurt and possibly think you're an asshole. If it helps, I'm a woman and, if I was her, I'd rather get it over with. But I'm a rip the bandaid off kind of person; not everyone is.

In our recent fights, she has repeatedly implied (or flat out said) that she doesn't think I care about her, which I keep telling her is unfair and hurtful because its blatantly untrue.  

Tonight, after telling her that I mixed up the dates and was going to attend my childhood friend's engagement party on Thursday (and therefore couldn't see her/resolve our fight until later Thursday night), she melted down and said that if I really cared about her as much as she cares about me, I wouldn't be going to this event.

"It's hard to get into the weeds of all this.

I repeatedly told her that we shouldn't have this fight over the phone, especially given that we were apart and emotions were running high, and should figure it out in person when she's home.

I told her today that I mixed up the dates for my close friend's engagement party, but I would come to hers directly after and we could resolve our disagreement after.  I took ownership of my mistake, apologized for letting her know late and disappointing her, and offered to see her before the party for a bit as well as seeing her after and being there to speak with her any time on Friday.

Of course she wants me to comfort her, and I've been trying to do that all week.  I keep telling her how I don't want to fight over the phone, as (knowing her) nothing gets ""resolved"" unless we're in-person, and that I wanted to be there for her to help her through her tough time.

"Tell him to do whatever he wants with the bra and to leave you alone. Regardless of who's ""right"", you two clearly dont work together. Healthy relationships dont involve the whole break-up-make-up bullshit. You two, especially him being almost 30, are too old for that. I think its time to be alone for a bit and think about what your needs are in a relationship and why you were willing to have them ignored in this one. Think about why you needed reassurance from him.

>it is hard cause I obviously still care and have feelings for him.

I get that, truly, however, its simply not enough. You cant love somebody into a better partner. Love doesnt negate harmful behaviors. Love doesnt make two ppl be compatible.

If asking for more quality time and reassurance turned into a massive fight, him gaslighting you, and blocking you then maybe forget the bra and try to move forward. He’s probably trying to open a line of communication and possibly get you to come over and pick up the bra so you can see one another. I’d say don’t entertain getting back together unless there’s a heart to heart and he sincerely apologizes for his bad behavior.

My ex and I broke up about 2months ago, it was both our first time dating and was only for a short period of time but we were serious about eachother. Due to unfortunate circumstances and really bad luck an ""incident"" happened and because of that she got really pissed at me and got carried away with her emotions and ended things(i can elaborate abt what happened if needed). We're only teens but i atleast know that if I dont start putting in effort she might carry the thought in her head that ""we were never good fit"" or something like that. I know im gonna sound like every other teen that is love struck but she really was different (where im from its really hard to find someone with basic morals and self respect). Im also gonna say that we both made a few mistakes (but the bomb that really ended things between us was the ""incident"") mostly me though cause before i met her i hardly knew things about relationships. But i tried to be better and i am now. The problem is that she doesnt wanna interact with me anymore in any way whatsoever. Knowing that this is also her first time dating she's obviously also having a hard time processing and thinking whats the best thing to do. Its not like we just talked to eachother a few times and immediately became a thing(very common where im from) but we actually had time to grow as a couple. We both liked eachother at roughly the same time and spent 6-7 months questioning ourselves about our feelings for eachother and if we were ready. I dont like to admit it but im almost certain that what doomed us from the start was that we went too fast of a pace. We couldve held things off for a year or two(strict parents) and that also wouldve given us more time to mature for eachother. It was my fault too for not thinking about this from the start and going along with dating her.

(Sorry if what i said or the order of things was all over the place english isnt my first language)

Thats pretty much it for now im asking for advice on what to do, if i should continue chasing her, when to stop and how to clear things between us. AMA if i need to elaborate things im more than willing to.

Also her bday is coming soon any ideas on what to get her is appreciated

Tldr : ex doesnt wanna interact with me       because of something that happened due to bad luck(will explain what happened though i dont think what happened is critical just that it was what ended us)

"I’m unhappy. My relationship is borderline non sexually affection-less unless I initiate. Because of this I (F23) think I want to break up with my boyfriend (M25) but we have a non refundable trip coming in three weeks. Or should I just accept that he is bad at giving affection and work things out? 

After 4 years and 3 breakups in the past 1 all initiated by me, I think I am done giving chances. After each breakup my patience is shorter and shorter and I think it finally hit me that even when things are “ok” I’m still unsatisfied with a relationship that has no kisses, hugs, or cuddles on most work days just because he’s tired. 

I love him a lot but I just go to sleep crying next to him most nights because he is so unaffectionate. I know he loves me in his love languages and has definitely slowly improved as long as I’m reminding him once every few days but I’m so tired of having to remind someone to be affectionate, I want someone to want to be affectionate. Amazing guy otherwise so sometimes I’m even gas lighting myself thinking maybe me wanting affection I’d the problem. 

He does seem to get a little sad when I am not as affectionate as I usually am but still doesnt really initiate anything (hugs/kisses/cuddling)

There’s so much more but I can be happy enough with him till the end of the trip (probably spend some of those nights crying) but if I already feel this way should I just cut our trip off or just enjoy this last hurrah with him and call it off once we get back?

Alternatively should I just commit to reminding him every few days to give me more affection since this is the only problem and our relationship is 4 years old? 

INFO: sex life is different, extremely positive and affectionate with both initiating sex equally. This is more about non sexual affection . 

TL;DR! I’m unhappy. My relationship is borderline non sexually affection-less unless I initiate.

"Tldr: friendships I hold extremely dear, I just feel hurt that they don't care the way I do sometimes. How do I explain to them how I feel?

NSFW tag because of mental health issues

I'm 19f, two are 20 and the third is 21.

I've been friends with them for 3-4 years, and they're the closest friends I have. I don't really know how to put it into words, but they're genuinely great friends. We're all mutually passionate and enthusiastic about each other's interests, and not a day goes by without a fun conversation. It's easy to speak and laugh with them, they've never purposely made me feel bad about anything.

Communicating with them is easy, if something bothers someone, bringing it up helps to solve the situation.

Except when I'm depressed. Depression sucks, depression makes me feel like nothing is worth it and nothing can be helped. Depression makes me feel like a bother and I don't know how to change that. Or welll, I know what would help, but I don't know how to ask for it, how to ask them

When it comes to my friends, I feel like I put more than they do when it has to do with serious topics? Ish? If something feels off, I'd reach out from the start. If they don't want to talk about it, I'd offer to be a distraction. I'd offer a lot of things.

I don't even know where I'm going with this honestly, and I'm sorry if I'm not making much sense? Basically it's just that they don't really reach out when I wish they did?

I'm aware we just show care differently, and I feel conceited when I think my way is better. But I've went literal months without having an actual conversation with them, just because of how bad things got for me. And I wished they helped, I wish they reached out and asked what was going on, but only one sometimes does and it's not in the way I wish she did.

I know they're not mind readers, and I'm pretty sure that if I asked they'd be willing to do what could help. But I can't help but wonder why I have to ask, why I have to... spell it out? I guess?

I feel bitter that they don't read between the lines, and I'm mad at myself for being upset with them. Because once again, they're not mind readers, they don't know what i want. But at the same time, when I try to put myself in their position, I just get upset because I wouldn't have let such a situation happen in the first place? If that makes sense

Because why is it so easy for them to act like everything is normal, when I'm obviously slipping into an episode? When I'm having a harder and harder time the longer it goes on?

And I'm mad at myself for thinking that, because why do I keep assuming their thoughts and reactions when I know it's not fair to them?

How do I explain to them what I want? How do I tell them I wish they were more like me, when it comes to stuff like this? I don't want to be a bother, but it kills me that I'm building up resentment over something so stupid. They're good friends, great friends, the best of friends.  But they show care differently and I hate that I sometimes question if they'd even miss me if I was gone.

How do I tell them I wish they acted more like me? That I wish they noticed the stuff I do for them, and did it back?

But also, isn't it unfair of me to want that? It feels like I'm building resentment for doing things my way, but I like doing things my way. I like helping and offering company, I like being there for others.

I think they try to be there for me, they always do so when I'm not in an episode, but how do I explain that I wish they did more? That i think doing things my way would help?

I'm sorry for how vague this post is, i don't know if I'm making much sense. I just don't want to be bitter anymore. They're genuinely great friends, I'm the one who has an issue with reaching out. How do I get better at that?

"Other people aren't you, and trying to change them is going to destroy your friendship. Yes, you are right, nobody can read your mind. If you want something, you have to tell it.

"i know i have to tell it, it's the how im struggling with. and i'm not trying to say they're my therapists, i'm well aware of that? I meant just overall being there, if that makes sense? i know they can't fix or prevent it, but i don't think wanting a listening ear every now and then is bad

We've had the conversation multiple times, that it's not like they could give a permanent solution to my problems, because nothing short of moving out would help (and i can't do that any time soon)

I don't want to outline the stuff i do to them because then it feels like i'm.. keeping a score? i guess?? and that's not the point i want to bring across, nor one i want to bring up at all. i do what i do because i love them, that's how i show it, i'm not upset over that

I think what i'm trying to say is that i wish they reached out more? without me asking for it? because i know they'd do it if i asked, but at the same time when things are bad, asking is the last thing on my mind?

And it's why i'm trying to figure out how to tell them now, rather than when things are bad again

"TL:DR Yes, I absolutely know that every woman has the right to do for herself as she wishes, and no one should act berzerk about it you are not as enthusiastic as she is...

And I am struggling...

We are in relationship for 5 years and she is the most beautiful brunette I have seen in my life and I fell in love the moment I saw her.

The thing about me... In my life I only fell for brunettes, simply put brown long nurtured hair was always the most adored part of female appearance to me, it's like a cherry on the top of all other characteristics.
I am not exaggerating if I say brunettes are my religion, I only see them and only believe in them.
Brown long hair is the most beautiful thing God created for a woman.

And she has it, always had it, beautiful brown, long hair, and she knows how much and how passionate I am about it.

But, she wants a change... She wants to go blonde, I am thinking somehow that Barbie movie inspired her, lol... But once she sets something in her mind it's only matter of time.

And I was not so enthusiastic about it, I didn't express myself how I bad feel about it and kept it for myself...

But man, I am really not looking forward for it... I am afraid I will somehow be less attracted to her... I know it's only hair, but for me it's not because it always was the pinacle of female attractivevnes...

"We have a two month old son. For arguments sake I didn’t say anything when it came to this agreement because we already argued so much up to this point. I am still in college online and I’m taking care of the baby alone 90% of the time since he works 10 hours 4 days out of the week. Ultimately he wants to stay at his best friends on certain days and with me and the baby on others.

He's telling you he only wants to be a parent when it's convenient for him. 

You need to either make a demand of him that he commit 100%, or you need to accept that you don't have much of a boyfriend and your kid doesn't have much of a father. 

You also need to use this as an opportunity to learn a new skill that will be vital to you as a parent going forward: if it is about the well-being of your child, you no longer have the luxury of agreeing to something shitty simply because you don't want to argue about it anymore. You are your child's first, best, and maybe only advocate. This is about you getting the support you need as a parent, but also about this man showing up for his own fucking kid. you don't get to just ""drop it"" anymore for the sake of ease.

Idk how to move on from (M20) my ex (F20) we broke up few days ago our relationship was amazing we dated for almost 5 monthsthe reason for the breakup was she just wasn’t ready for a rls and the obstacles that would come our way , she never communicated isn’t willing to in the future as shes a big time people pleaser (her own words) and the issues we had were extremely minor and due to lack of communication everything built up and hurt her despite me telling her communication is yhe most important in a rls. I’ve deleted all of our pics and everything and I unfollowed her but idk if I should block her we haven’t talked since but I tend to keep opening her profile and that sucks , Idk how im gonna face her once Uni starts as well

Tl;dr idk how to move on from my ex idk if I should block her like if thats the right thing to do and Idk how ill face her in Uni once it starts as ill be seeing her everyday and will be difficult to avoid."

5 months is really early to be having problems like this. You guys are still young , only 20, so she may be a bit immature I guess. but why do YOU have to put up with the games? She doesn’t want to communicate, she refuses to put in the effort for the relationship. Doesn’t seem like she cared. Do you think she has sat and opened your profile , debating wether or not to get you back? Settle for a woman who actually wants to build with you. There’s so many of them.  As well as so many women who would kill to have a man who values communication. I’m only 23, but have been through alot when it comes to having  a partner who didn’t care at all. If she’s willing to let you go so easily, don’t go after her.	SatisfactionUnable84	reply	na	na	na	0.9983660578727722	weak	strong	no	na	relationships

I can’t help but feel resentment towards him. He says I need to cook and clean more and argue less with him for him to move in with me and consider proposing. I mean I get that… but I also feel bad about myself feeling as though he doesn’t “love me enough” how I am. I don’t feel accepted.

It's not clear what the reality is here. How are you paying your living expenses without a job? How do you divide up your chores, noting that you have two separate households?"	ThrowRA1212098	reply	na	na	na	0.998256266117096	no	strong	no	na	relationships
"In comments you describe how your parents help you out with expenses.

There’s nothing wrong with that, and it’s nothing to be ashamed of.

But marriage is a lifelong partnership.  Somebody not fully pulling his or her own weight is going to be a burden to those who do, in the Zombie Apocalypse that is a lifelong commitment.  A decision to marry or even move in together depends on adding value to one another’s life.

All that’s to say, his reluctance to commit irrevocably is understandable.

"What flags this to me as interesting is that he spends 90% of his time at your place but is still maintaining and another apartment. That certainly feels like a significant fact.

Ostensibly, he has laid out his criteria for moving forward in the relationship - he wants you to do more. This is hard to rate across the internet, because we have to rely on a biased assessment about the division of labor/spending and what each of you is bringing to the table.

So what are the household duties and how are they split? What is the budget and how is it split? Has he stated a preference for how those are handled, what is your preference?

Of course the arguing is also a big factor. How often are you insuring? What are they generally about? What is communication like and how are they get resolved?

There is definitely a version of this story where he is being perfectly reasonable and cautious about moving forward with a relationship that just isn't hitting the way it should. There is also a version of this relationship where this guy basically just wants you to be a bangmaid and is dangling these commitment carrots to try and get you to go along with it.

I think stepping back from the situation and trying to look at it from like a distant and neutral perspective (granted that is tough) can be helpful. But at the end of the day your subjective feelings and needs are important and the vibes matter. So with that, I do think it's worth thinking about what your life looks like without this guy in it, because I think you can get into the weeds, chasing someone's approval and affection to the point where You can't see that there are approval and affection isn't really worth all the effort.

TL;DR - it's time for a rigorous self-assessment of the state of affairs. What dies your ideal situation look like? How does your current situation resemble that? What would it take to match those two? Ultimately, is this guy helping you make that happen or is he standing in the way of it?"

"So my fiancé & I used to text all the time and he very excited about each-other of course. Even if he does text me now, I am still eager to respond. Both of us have had job changes, but I know that he currently loves his job and everything about it. 

For the last few months he hasn’t been texting me unless it’s something important, or a question. We see each other every weekend and in between sometimes as well due to jobs, but other than that, we don’t talk much if we aren’t hanging out. 

For example, he used to send good morning and good night texts. Now, I get zero…unless we are texting about something random (not very often) and one of us finally says that we’re going to bed. So none of that out of the blue. I send him texts the most, and he will just forget to look at them or respond to them. He’s always on his phone though, watching Instagram reels and YouTube videos. He always has his phone in his hand. 

He will call me for a bit before I go to work, but we don’t really talk on the phone because he is either drifting off to sleep, hanging up the call to go eat with his parents, or watching Instagram reels. Occasionally we will get a meaningful conversation out of it. Right when that phone hangs up, I usually don’t hear anything from him until the next day when he calls me before work. 

I guess what I’m asking is, is this behavior normal? Is he just extremely low maintenance? He says he’s not big into texting, but he definitely used to be at the beginning of our relationship. 

Any advice?? 

TL;DR: Fiancé & I used to text all the time for the first year of dating. Now, he only calls me before I go to work and we don’t get much meaningful conversation out of it.

Talk to him. Just talk to him. If you’re getting married, you should be able to talk about stuff at this point. Sit him down and let him know how this is bothering you and what you hope for in relationship communication.

I have let him know. Many many times. All he says is “I’m just not really on my phone/a texting person” but I swear he is literally always on his phone, at least when he’s with me. If we decide to eat at a restaurant, we will get our shoes on and he will whip is phone out while he’s walking up the stairs to his car. He’ll go on his phone while we’re waiting to order, on his phone even inside of the shower on Instagram and stuff. I’ve said things many times and he just doesn’t make amends.

"A couple of years ago I met Josh on Discord and we just happened to live about 45 minutes from each other. We had a crazy amount of things in common and would talk constantly. Even some of our more niche interests aligned which I've never had happen before outside of Reddit groups. 

Josh was kinda flirty with me starting about a week after we started talking. At around the 3 month mark I had really noticed he seemed into me, and I was super into him. We had seen pictures of each other and stuff, but nothing inappropriate. I was falling for him hard and I hadn't felt like this about someone in a long time.

We decided to meet up and....things weren't awkward but I could tell something changed. He was more distant and the flirting stopped. I kinda figured it out myself and it honestly broke my heart. He would only talk to me on occasion and if we played a game together at all things felt tense and he would even snap at me. 

This went on for like a week before I finally asked him what happened and that I had feelings for him. He told me I ""wasn't his type"" and that he wasn't going to enter a relationship he didn't think would work out. He said I made him feel loved and cared about more than anyone though. I asked him what his ""type"" was and he mentioned a list that included thin, which I was not (240lbs at 5' 3"" at the time). 

I was devastated at that point. We kinda stopped talking for a little bit and would only have scarce conversations about nothing. If I left him on read though he would message me 2-3 times per day until I responded. I was confused as to why he would want my attention when he barely talked to me anyway. We played a game together maybe twice during this period of him mostly rejecting to do anything with me, and both times were unpleasant because he would snap at me. He constantly posted to social media about how lonely he was and that just rubbed salt in the wound. 

About a year has passed and I've actually lost a good amount of weight. I'm not where I want to be yet but I'm making progress. I posted some pictures on social media and Josh saw them. He messaged me asking me how I've been and some other small talk. I noticed very quickly he was becoming flirty like the first time. My gut reaction was anger. I left him on read a few hours ago and he's of course being a bit spammy now.

I know physical attraction is a huge part of relationships but I just can't get over how hurt I felt before. Josh admits he himself isn't many peoples type physically but I loved him all the same. Since he prefers really skinny girls I feel like I'd constantly be on edge about gaining any weight. Pregnancy? Depression? I'd always be worried. 

I love him and care about him deeply, I want him to be happy. I want to be with him but I dont know if I can ever feel secure dating him. 

How should I respond when he eventually asks me out?

It’s okay for people to be attracted to certain body types, but if they were never even nice to you and now suddenly flirting, those are not the people you want to be friends with or date. You know your worth and it’s a hell of a lot more than what you look like!

Yes, attraction plays a role but my problem with people who are only interested after you lose weight is the future. In future you might get pregnant, so for months he won't be attracted to you. In future you might develop a health issue that is debilitating and causes weight gain, now he's not attracted to you.

This is also why I wouldn't go for older men only attracted to my youth because what happens when I don't look young anymore? He's already shown you that he comes with a red flag. You deserve better than that."	TASU2024	reply	na	na	na	0.9978979825973511	no	no	no	na	relationships

Honestly, he doesn’t sound like someone you should be engaging with at all. If his comments online hurt you (ie rubbing salt in wounds) why are you still even looking at his social media? I know it might sound hard now, but cutting contact with him opens up a chapter of your life without this deadweight dragging you down indirectly.

"the bottom line is that you shouldn’t be with someone who isn’t even kind to people they don’t find attractive. he didn’t find you attractive, that’s fine, but that’s no reason to be mean to someone. 

it sounds like he was angry with you because he had a certain expectation and you didn’t meet it, then he got angry and he directed that anger towards you. that doesn’t sound like a healthy way to handle his emotions. 

you don’t want to be the exception. you don’t want to be the only girl a guy is nice to. you want to be the person a nice guy chooses to spend his time with. your appearance is only one aspect of you, and it’s the part that changes the most with time. id avoid him, because it doesn’t sound like he even values you as a friend, he just likes that you give him attention and how it makes him feel."

Look I’m 35 and sadly I’ve been on the 200+/- scale my whole life. At my lowest in my adult life I weighed 180lbs and at my highest not including when I was pregnant I weight 255. I’m currently 200.

"Leaving this dude aside, 240 lbs. for a woman your height (and mine) is not just ""fat."" That's medically in the category of morbid obesity and is extremely unhealthy. I may have missed it but I hope you've been under a doctor's care during your weight loss.

Related to the above, someone not being attracted to you as an obese+ person does not mean they're only into ""super skinny girls.""

From your comments, it sounds to me like your size has been a way of hiding from the world. As girls and women, we're under the microscope, and many people feel more comfortable not being checked out sexually, especially if there has been trauma.

This guy may well be unaware of how his hot/cold routine is affecting you. I think what you need right now is not a boyfriend, but genuine friendship. He's too immature it seems.

I'm going to add a counter point. In the end none of us can judge the subtext of his actions and he could be very shallow. That said... people working on themselves and building a confidence in themselves independently is typically very attractive. You weren't working on fitness for him or anyone, you were working towards a goal because it was important to you. I would find that attractive on its own. If you think that is what drew his attention, and you feel a connection explore it. If you think he is shallow and not worth your time then reject him and find someone who admires you for all your facets.	TASU2024	reply	na	na	na	0.9978979825973511	weak	no	no	na	relationships
Congrats on the weight loss, and I'm sorry to say this, but - statistically, you are likely to regain the weight at some point in your life, unless you have made serious lifestyle changes. Entering a relationship with someone who you already know can't stand you when you are overweight is not a good idea. Calmly ignore his overtures, if you can.

"Ok, I'm probably going to end up with a -100 score but I present this just for something to consider. I apologize in advance if I hurt anyones feelings. It truly is not my intent.

At 5'3"" and 240 lbs, you were in morbid obesity territory. Maybe as you talked on the phone and video you hid your weight well. The sudden shift in behavior could have been that both of you could sense something there and he felt trapped. He definitely should have handled it better. That sounds like either a young or an inexperienced guy. 

So quick question. What was his height and weight? Was he a guy that maintains himself or is he someone who expects the thin girl while not maintaining himself to the same standard? I've always thought it's unfair when a person doesn't diet/exercise expecting to be with someone who does. I've seen both men and women do that so it's not gender specific. 

We have a family member who has trouble finding dates. She had a guy hit on her and she told us ""I'm not attracted because he's very large"". This girl is easily 100 lbs overweight herself. She showed us a couple of guys she was interested in. One guy was probably 6'3"" and 240 lbs. The other guy was probably 6'1"" and 200 lbs. While they weren't in perfect shape, they were closer to healthy weights than she is.  How is it fair for her to have a different standard for her guys than she does for herself?

I don't know the whole story here but just providing something to think about. Yes, weight is not everything but assuming the guy is a total jerk just because he tried creating distance when the relationship started shifting toward romance isn't completely fair either."

"Weightless is as much an emotional/mental journey as it is a physical one. You've probably changed in more ways than just one, so unless he states otherwise I'd really suggest you don't just focus on the weight being what caused him to disengage. It could have been confidence, it could have been food related behaviour he noticed, it could have been mentality or outlook. It could have been a mixture of a whole host of things that caused the shift in perspective, from interested in dating to interested in friendships. So don't beat yourself up about your former weight as the singular cause.

Now that I've said that, if he couldn't treat you with respect after he realized it wasn't going to be a romantic relationship, then he isn't worth your care for him. There are so many ways to respectfully decline contact, even respectfully brush someone off that continues to show interest when you don't hold it.

"I'll use the names Vanessa and Sue.

Vanessa hosts many events. She follows me randomly on IG and messages me about an event she's hosting (she saw my IG attached to an event I attended in the past). I thought it was a little weird but I'm new to the city so I said yes. 

Once arrived, I recognized someone and they said ""oh you must be Vanessa's date"". I'm very confused because nothing gave me that indication. I talked to Vanessa to explain the misunderstanding as it made me uncomfortable.

1 hour later, I meet Sue. We really hit it off. After 30m of talking, Vanessa comes over and asks Sue who she knows as she didn't recognize her. A little awkward, but they smoothed it over as Sue came with two friends to this semi-public event.

Sue and I continue, I call her pretty and ask if she's single, she says yes and **she agrees to go on a date**. I'm excited. 

20m later Vanessa comes back and pulls me aside saying she's upset I'm not talking to her enough. I apologize and say I'm here to make friends too. I bring up the misunderstanding from earlier.

I go back to Sue and explain the misunderstanding, she laughs it off with me but I feel bad and I decide to go smooth things over a bit with Vanessa. Not long after Sue decides to go home as she's tired, I say bye on the way out and tell her to text me.

I decide to go home not long after and I respond to Sue apologizing for the situation earlier and hope she still had a good night. She says she did. I text Vanessa and say I had a good time but only want to be friends as I was uncomfortable at the party.

A day later I text Sue suggesting a date, she responds with:

> ""Hey X :), Hmm I'm not feeling too good still about the Vanessa party thing. I think that has really tainted the energy of our meeting. Hoping for more time to pass and neutralize my connection with you, if that makes sense""

I respond by saying I understand how she feels and that I'd appreciate the opportunity for a quick call to shed light on the situation as I fear she didn't get the full picture in hopes of making her feel better. No response yet from yesterday.

TL;DR It's been a long time since I've met someone I really click with and showed a lot of interest in me in return. I want to take her out and fix this situation."	anonymouspsy	post	32.6827178398418	male	White	0.9878538846969604	na	na	na	1	relationships

"So basically I 17(F) and 17(M) jake this guy i met from highschool let’s call him Jake. Jake and i were on and off fwb in a way and then it broke off and got back to it being fwb. then during second semester i found out he had a girlfriend, but that didn’t stop him from wanting to sext with me. He would constantly send nudes, flirty texts, wanting to hangout alone and be drunk, and overall very sexual, never once bringing up his girlfriend. 

i’ll be honest, the reason why i never told his gf when it first started was becahse Jake fucked me up and i wanted to hurt him in the same way he hurt me. I didn’t ever say anything to the gf but now i’m considering it because: 

i see their posts together and it disgusts me because he is always out with her and he even met her family. Jake is an actual narcissistic dickhead and said many times he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. I want to tell her so they can finally break up because it’s honestly kinda sad that she freely walks around thinking her bf is not a cheater. 

Never once did jake think what he was doing was wrong he never stopped himself. But then if i were to tell his girlfriend, this upcoming september i would have to deal with his bullshit for a year and possibly have rumours made up about me. It will be my last year either way and i’m just not sure how to go about it? 

Btw i do have a bunch of screenshots and proof just incase he tries to pull out some random thing back on me. 

Do i tell her and possibly ruin my “reputation” at school or tell her when school ends which is next year but idk how long they’ll stay together for.

TL;DR basically he cheats on her consistently with me and she doesn’t know about it but i want to tell her without having him attack me at school"	achlys19	post	10.367834979284924	male	White	0.9954948425292969	na	na	na	7	relationships

"I [21M] have a cousin [18F] who is 3 years younger than me. We're not that close in general and rarely speak with each other. For some reason I feel her as a special person in my life from long time and I don't know what exactly that feeling is. 

Since childhood I used to get different feeling when I speak with her (something special) since the first time I remember speaking with her and idk the reason behind it.

Sometimes I feel like she's the most important person in my life and I want to speak with her, spend some time with her and get to know more about her. 

I don't know if it's love or something else. I questioned myself many times and I don't think it's love. I don't see her as someone whom I want to be my girlfriend or anything of that kind. For some reason I feel very comfortable with her and I like to speak/spend some time with her. We spoke about multiple things, including some stuff which I usually avoid and she speaks/responds to me well (i'm an introvert and she's an extrovert so she's good at interacting with people and having conversations with them imo and she will mostly do the same with someone else too). 

We were going through a list of questions from Instagram and she answered *who am I to you* with *brotherly friend*. 

I think about her many times every day and I feel like messaging her but most of the times I just avoid it. 

Who is she to me? I ask this question to myself many times and I've never got an answer. She's not like someone whom I can't consider as a sister and I don't think it's common to think a lot about a friend or best friend. At same time I can't say she's someone whom I want to have a relationship with (or something like her).

Any kind of inputs related to my condition helps a lot in getting my mind straight. I thought of posting this from long time and finally decided to post it now.

Sorry about bad formatting, improper description. I'm new to posting stuff online and I don't know how to make posts and all

"We are both in our 20s. Together for 2 months, good friends for a year before that. 

I'm trying to keep this at least somewhat vague, but long story short I'm a person with a lot of problems while she seems to have most things figured out. Shes financially well off, emotionally stable, has a good relationship with her family, lots of friends etc. while I am quite literally the opposite of all of these + even more. I'm a broke, mentally ill loner who grew up in the foster system. 

Because of all of this (and also just feeling like she's physically way out of my league as well and could probably have almost anyone she wants) I have no idea why she likes me and why she'd even want to be in a relationship with me in the first place. I was transparent about all of my problems from the start, and there wasn't much I could've hidden from her anyways because we were friends way before we started dating. To give an example of something shes witnessed and regardless of it still wanted to get together with me afterwards, she literally spent time with me in the hospital after I OD'd. Like it can't get much lower than that. 

I've brought these things up with her every now and then, and something that shes referenced more than once is her having a ""saviour complex"", mostly in a joking way though. I've also taken it as a joke but then she's done very kind things for me when I haven't even asked her to and it hasn't been expected of her, such as helping me get a job and also paying some of my bills behind my back (I kept refusing so she did it in secrecy and I'm now working on paying her back even though she said I didn't have to). Not to mention her listening to me talk about whatever problem I'm dealing with at the moment. 

I've started to wonder that if in the end, I'm just a ""project"" for her to fix, because I see no other reason for her wanting to be with someone like me. And I do appreciate everything she's done and keeps doing for me, and I want to be ""worthy"" of her and I'm working on myself as much as is humanly possible, but I'm terrified that if I can't change or can't change fast enough it'll lead to her just feeling like a failure for not being able to ""fix me."" And I know that some of my negative qualities aren't fixable, and I have some personality traits that have been a part of me ever since I was a small child that aren't ideal, and I don't want her to only date me because she thinks she can change those things about me. 

Another fear that I have which maybe isn't rational, is that her whole thing is fixing people (her self-described ""saviour complex"") and once she deems me sufficiently ""fixed"", she'll just leave me and move on to another ""project.""

I have no idea if this post makes any sense, or if it just sounds like an insane problem I've created myself in order to self-sabotage or something. Or if this is all completely mundane and I'm just overthinking this way too much. Idk. Help

"I've been married to my husband [31M] for 6 years now. I'm not particularly close with my in laws as we have different personalities, but we live in their hometown, 1500 miles away from my hometown and my family, so I see my in laws often enough. 

About a month ago, my father fell very, terminally ill. It was a huge shock as he had been very healthy beforehand. I took my 1yo and flew home the day I got the call, and stayed for 2 weeks to help my mom handle things. The doctors gave my dad 3 to 6 months to live, so I got him set up with hospice and spent time saying goodbye to him. It was the hardest 2 weeks of my life. My in laws were aware of what was happening, as they were there the day I got the call. I didn't receive a text or call that entire 2 weeks, but whatever. It was easier not to deal with any added stress. 

A week after I'd returned to my current state, I got the call that my father had passed. Obviously I was devastated bc they had given him a few months estimate, and I wasn't able to make it back to see him one last time. I spent that day crying and packing, and my FIL came to help watch the baby. 

My husband, our baby, and I flew home the very next day so I could help my mom plan the funeral, and handle things. A lot of people sent flowers to the service, and a lot MORE people sent cards. I thought it was the norm that my in laws would send flowers, but we didn't receive anything, not even a card. I didn't get a text or a phone call, no 'sorry for your loss', nothing. 

We're home now, and he still hasn't reached out beyond a quick ""sorry for your loss, hope your trip went well"". It's not about the money. I'm hurt that I've been their DIL for 6 years and they couldn't be bothered to acknowledge the death of my dad. This is my first loss, my very first experience with grief. I'm not ok. I'd like to confront them (my husband never will, he never has when we've had problems in the past), but I want to make sure I'm not overreacting. Should they have sent flowers? Do I seem greedy or selfish for hoping they would have? I can provide more info if needed.

Some people don’t send cards and flowers. They show their care in other ways, like watching your baby so you can pack.

What outcome are you hoping or even expecting to come from such a confrontation? Do you have any reason at all to expect them to suddenly realize they forgot to send a card or reach out more than the one time they did? Or for them to give a heartfelt apology? No offense, but I can't imagine anything positive coming out of such a confrontation - especially since your own husband won't stand up to them. Reading between the lines, they sound like the kind of people to dog in their heels, not ones who care what you think of them.

I think it's best to file this away as a lesson learned about the kind of people they are.

You are well within your rights to feel upset or frustrated but I don't think confronting them is going to do anything productive and while sending flowers would have been a wonderful thought confronting them for not sending flowers comes off rude/entitled. Seems like you know where you stand with them and should lower your expectations in the future when it comes to babysitting and involvement.

If you do need to communicate your feelings with them I would make sure you lead with ""i"" statements and not accusations. For example, say ""it hurt my feelings that you only reached out that one time via text.

Based on your other comment I think you have to many unwarranted expectations regarding your in-laws.

They don’t owe you those things therefore you can’t hold it against them when you don’t get it. Many people likewise don’t. The fact that they do help out even 50/50 is pretty good actually you should be more appreciative of that instead of calling them unreliable, you aren’t meant to rely on your in-laws for those things unless they agreed to provide them to begin with.

"I’m about your age and my mom died two years ago. I went through some of what you’re experiencing where people didn’t reach out or step up in ways that I expected them to. 

First I want to say, it’s ok to feel hurt. But I had to learn a couple of things through my grief journey. One is that there are a shocking amount of people who just don’t know what to do or act when a person experiences a huge loss. Sometimes it even comes from people that by all accounts should know. I also had to remember people aren’t mind readers and I couldn’t hold things against them if they didn’t react in the way I’d want. It seems like it should be easy to know but different people want different things. For instance, I like people reaching out on my mom’s birthday and death day but my cousin has said she doesn’t think she would like that when her time comes. So I don’t hold it against her when she doesn’t reach out to me on those days because she’s doing what she would want others to do for her. 

I know you didn’t ask for this, but I always like to pass this on to people who have lost someone when they are young. When and if you are ready for some kind of grief support, check out The Dinner Party. It’s geared towards people our age and if you find the right mix of people, it’s so amazing. I’ve been meeting online with my group for almost two years now and they’ve been a huge support and able to help me through a lot of my grief. 

I hope that you are able to find some healing. It can be so life altering and traumatic and the first months are such a topsy turvy of emotions."	Apocalypsze	reply	na	na	na	0.9983779191970825	weak	strong	no	na	relationships

One perspective to consider is no card, angel statue, or gift will bring your dad back. I sometimes refrain from giving gifts because to me it feels cheap- like no card can ever replace the love of a father. It almost seems demeaning from my perspective. Perhaps, just maybe that’s their take on it too.	Apocalypsze	reply	na	na	na	0.9983779191970825	no	strong	no	na	relationships
I think you are very understandably and justifiably in a state of grief, but I would take a step back from this situation and realize that sending flowers or cards is not always the norm. You don't go much into your relationship with your in-laws before all this other than saying that you aren't particularly close so I don't see why you suddenly expect them to do these kinds of things and begrudge them when they didn't. They offered to babysit and do tangible things that would lessen your actual stress it sounds like, for many that would be far more beneficial than sending flowers to someone's funeral that they likely barely knew if they live 1500 miles apart. You are in pain and suffering, don't open up unnecessary conflict in your life. If it truly bothers you then bring it up to your partner in a non-accusatory kind of way and see if he can help you process these feelings.

Sorry for your loss. I'm at an age between you and your in-laws. I literally learned this week how to handle the death of someone you are not close to. There is an etiquette involved that is not inherent in any one person and is culturally different. Not knowing what to do is often dealt with by doing nothing. I don't think they set out to hurt you (I don't know they but that would be awfully cruel) but I would hope you wouldn't judge them to harshly while you are in a hyper sensitive state.

"I am very sorry for your loss! Some families are different regarding what is seen to be normal behavior. It does not necessarily has to do with anything about your relationship. 
I have a similar problem with my inlaws. My expectations were just too high and now we are stuck living close to them and far away from my family. My family is not great by any standard but i expected more of my partners family as they are helpful towards their children (except for my partner). They are not the emotional type and also support more my partners siblings than him or me. And it will never be different. The dont care to really get to know me. Normal chatting and small talk yes, real talking no. I dont feel supported or cherished. I will always just be their sons partner and that is my role. I dont expect them to call me if they know i struggle or to come by if we struggle. So thats it. 
I am extremely sad because they were really happy to see us when we lived far away but i realised it was the distance that made them happy when i visited. 

Now i just want to move away. It will help to regulate my expectations and make it less obvious we dont have supporting family here. Could that be a solution for you as well??

Feel hugged. You will be alright. You will keep your memories and in certain moments you will think of him.

Are you overreacting?  Yes and No.   
No, because this is your father and how dare they not understand and sympathize with your loss, especially because they are ""FAMILY"".  Yes, because you cannot control people, or their emotions or expect people to react a certain way. Maybe the baby sitting was the most support they could/knew who to give.  


I wouldn't confront them, because frankly no matter what you say, they will not change. They have shown you who they are.

My brother died unexpectedly, while I was on my honeymoon 10 months ago. My in-laws came to the funeral and all that jazz. Just just 4 weeks later they were asking WHY my husband and I were spending Christmas with my parents and not them. Hum, I dunno, because their only son just died? They have not been sensitive to my loss.   


What I have learned is that for the most part, people won't change. Confronting them will do nothing but give you a very temporary sense of relief but it will not ease your grief."	Apocalypsze	reply	na	na	na	0.9983779191970825	strong	no	no	na	relationships
"My in-laws are the same way. My mom died last year after an out of the blue cancer diagnosis, it took about six months and was awful and traumatic the whole time and even though they live in the next town and knew the whole time they never once called or stopped by. They literally didn’t even come to the funeral even though my MIL is a pastor! 

We don’t fight, or disagree, they met my mom a bunch, there is no argument to be had here, it just really showed me who they are as people. 

My partner was/is totally on my side about my grief and such but he knows how they are and doesn’t fight with them about it because they are never going to change so he just focuses on supporting me. His first wife was really distraught over it and it was a component of ending their marriage where I had already done the whole “in-laws” as a new family thing with my first marriage and as far as I’m concerned if this is how they want to be, it’s fine with me."

"I'm sorry you lost your father so suddenly, after being told you had more time.  You and your mother are probably still somewhat in shock, and having to deal with all the sad duties that must be done when someone close dies.

I'm older than your parents, or your husband's parents.  I have dealt with the death of a lot of friends and family.  I understand how valuable and important it is to formally acknowledge death, and to participate in the simple rituals around death, like writing a note in a card, or sending flowers, or making a donation in memory of the person, especially if you are not nearby and cannot attend the funeral or help with food or tasks.

But there are fewer and fewer people who do this, it seems to me.  I'm not sure why.  Some of it is cultural, I guess.  To me, it seems like writing a brief note is a small task, but apparently it's difficult for lots of people.

It's understandable that you expected your husband's parents to give you some acknowledgement.  Their reasoning may have been that they did not personally know your father, which shows they truly do not understand that *the rituals are for the living.*

You are not being greedy or selfish.  You hurt.  You are grieving the loss of someone you loved who had been with you every day of your life, and now is gone.

My parents on the other hand enjoy sending cards in the mail. They’re overseas, but are very involved when my son visits. They still send birthday and Christmas cards to my former MIL and extended family. If you come from a family where love is expressed overtly, you might feel hurt by the lack of that expression.

"I’m so sorry for your loss. I lost my dad very unexpectedly 1.5y ago. I try to focus on not what I lost out on, not being able to say goodbye before being the main one, but that the last time I saw him was such a great day. I’m really grateful for that one. 

My SIL had the same reaction to me when her dad died. She had very clear expectations to everyone around her when he passed. But didn’t tell anyone. Anyone who missed the mark she used as someone to place her anger on. It was a way to deal with her grief. Her worry about her mum who was now on her own. While being the one who had to make all the decisions for the funeral, finish all the paperwork and so much more. She was there for her mum so much she had no real channel for her grief. Didn’t want to acknowledge it. So it was easier to hide behind anger. 

I didn’t do anything, but neither was I aware of any expectations. My parents sent flowers on all our behalf. I sent text letting them know I’d be happy to come babysit or help them in any way possible. But I sent it to my brother. Assuming she was dealing with her grief. 

I get it hurts. But your grief is not theirs. If your relationship has not been great before (mine wasn’t with my SIL) it’s often easy to assume to the negative. Get angry. They’ve been through what you go through now, but that does not mean they’ve gone through what you have. Each relationship is different. Each loss hit us different. There is no fixed formula for loss or dealing with grief. The grief will also be different. 

Talk to your husband about how you feel. Ask him why they might be acting like this. Explain how you perceive it but also ask for what he thinks is behind it. They might be trying to show their respect by giving you time and space, which is how my family used to deal with things. 

As people we don’t come with instructions, and each relationship is different. It’s hard. Try to remember all the good things with your dad. The time you now get together with the family and friends that you do have around you. You’ve said you don’t have the best relationship with your in-laws, so maybe be grateful for them showing their respect by giving space (but also show up immediately as soon as you ask them).

Even if they are being rude by not reaching out, they are your in-laws and they are who they are. It’s best to meet them where they are at, accept that they aren’t the type to reach out in these times and approach future interactions accordingly.

"First off, I am so very sorry for your loss. You are experiencing a lot of emotions right now associated with grief, and I dont think you should mention it to them at this time. If it still bothers you in a few months, I think you will have a clearer head on what you would want to say and think that would be a better time. You never know, they might just be late to giving you their condolences. A month is not a long time, even though I'm sure it feels that way right now. They may be waiting for a better time, or the small condolence you did already receive might be all. You said they aren't very personable, and people get very awkward around the subject of death.

My cousins did not acknowledge when my dad passed away very suddenly this past December. No call, no text, no card, no flowers. Absolutely nothing. I actually did not know they were aware he had died. They acted, for the most part, normal when they saw me a few months after he passed, and I figured they did not know. My aunt, their mother, knew and sent me her condolences. My aunt said she told them about it, but I did not know because they made no indication to me about it. 

One of my cousins has a wedding coming up, and that was all she could talk about the two times I've seen her since he died. Her soon-to-be FIL died very suddenly a month or so ago. I sent her and her fiance a very heart-felt card about how my father had died recently and how I would be happy to talk with them or just lend a listening ear since I was just in their same position. I text her, letting her know I had sent a card, and I was sorry for their loss. She replied, but has not text me back since then, indicating she got the card or sorry for my loss for my own dad. She just does not care and is very wrapped up in her own self. I see her in such a different light now, that she is just a toxic narcissistic person.

In fact, no one did (though a coworker gave me a card and a rosebush to plant in memory). I didn't think anything of it, because to someone else in my position I wouldn't send a card or flowers either. In my experience grief just can't be alleviated with those things. And while the thought is nice, I feel like suddenly having cards and flowers to deal with, and condolences to respond graciously to, just adds to the burden of grief.

I am telling you this just so you can consider a perspective that a lack of gifts does not mean they don't care. It may be a cultural nuance, or a personal assumption of what is appropriate, but it is not an indication that they don't care! In fact, it sounds like they do since they were there for you when you needed them. That sort of commitment is much more personal and important than sending a card.

"I’m so very sorry for your loss.

Five years ago I lost my brother suddenly. I’m speaking from that point of view. When you lose someone so very important to you, it’s like a curtain falls over your eyes and separates you from your community - it can be difficult to connect to people, difficult to maintain relationships, difficult to let things go. It changes how you relate. Many of us go through a period of reassessing our relationships. It sounds like you are going through that. 

Death customs vary. It sounds like your in laws did what they thought made sense - they texted you. They might think that that’s enough based on their community expectations. They might also think that you or your husband would reach out if you wanted more. They also might be shocked and be referencing their own experiences with death and what they’d want done, ie “when my sister died I wanted to be left alone, I’ll leave Appcalypsze be until she reaches out so she doesn’t feel smothered like I did.” 

I do not think that you should confront them because I don’t think there’s been a lapse of decorum or caring. If they can be leaned on at all, I think that this is the time to call in on those community ties. Let them watch the baby so you and your husband can grieve together. Ask your husband to set the expectation that for the holidays you’ll be with your family. Ask for some freezer meals if that’s something they offer bereaved family members. You can and should deputize your husband to make these requests for you. Your pain is going to last for years, and anything you can do in these early days, while people remember that you’re in pain - because their memory will be so much shorter than yours - you should do.

I’m really sorry that this happened. It’s so shitty and it’s heartbreaking that you’re having these questions right now about how much your in laws value you. But please know that this comparison/assessment of other relationships is normal. Maybe in 3-6 months you will feel the same way; maybe you’ve always felt that they didn’t value you.

I understand that this is a massive event for your life, however, it isn’t for them. They may also feel awkward and not know what to do. People get bizarre about grief. They do not know how to handle it, or how to handle someone going through it. 

You should take some time for you right now, and focus on the memories you have with your dad. Reach out to someone if you need to. But you should take more time to process.

"People send flowers and a card because they aren't physically present with you besides the funeral.   The in laws have been with you so their in-person assistance replaces the card.    
       
Also what do you mean it's not about the money?   There's no expectation of giving money during this time.  If someone sent a card with money, that's very unusual.

"I’m going through something similar though nothing as heartbreaking as my father passing. I’m a total daddy’s girl so that would be so hard for me, I can’t imagine what you’re going through!

I recently moved to a new *country* to be with my boyfriend and I’m thousands of miles away from my dog, my parents, my siblings, and my friends. I haven’t got any check ins from his family or shopping trips (to help bf and I stock the house) or help with large purchases which would be the norm from my family (and my family is NOT well off!) I am growing resentful by the day.

Similar to your story, where we’re in expectation limbo, his stepmom did reach out—she kindly said to reach out to her if I need anything or someone to talk to since I’m in a new place. So I asked her to send me some pictures from her vacation and I mentioned that we have no cutlery. We got a package of cutlery in the mail but I found out later his dad was the one who saw my email and is the one who mailed the forks, while I never got any vacation pictures and I never heard from his stepmom again.

So it’s hard for me to relate to the other posters saying “They did reach out! It’s just that you didn’t get a card which is your own expectations!” Yeah but this is just what’s decent isn’t it??? It’s unbelievable to me that all you got is a text and I feel like I’m being ghosted. I’m in a new place thousands of miles from everything I know, in an empty house and I’m lonely. I need that support. What is with the weird non response.

I even wrote a thank you note and didn’t get a response.

I talked to my boyfriend about it. He kinda said like “oh she probably just forgot or wasn’t thinking of you” but that’s just the thing, isn’t it? Anyway I asked him to tell them (as nicely as possible) that I want to know if they got my thank you note and the lack of response kinda made me self-conscious at the same time that I’m having trouble adjusting. So hopefully they feel bad and buy us a toaster or whatever lol

The point isn’t about the stuff, it’s the lack of gesture. I want to feel appreciated that I love their son enough to uproot my life. I agree your husband and my bf can’t really “confront” them. But see if he can drop some hints to hear their side of the story. I have to say, what I don’t like about my situation (and I’m sure you feel the same way) is now I’m not “impressed” by these people. They seem selfish to me. It’s a value difference. Sure, we can lower our expectations, but I have high expectations for the people in my life. My bf needs to know that and help me manage the situation. It COULD be a misunderstanding. 

Your husband can let them know in a nonconfrontational way that you’re hurting from your father passing and was hoping for a card. Maybe even super smart like “Apocalypse is collecting all the condolence cards to put in a memory box for her father, did you send one? We’d really like to put one from you in the box!” 

I realize it’s not ideal behavior towards others but I just think people this rude have to be managed. Like who treats their family like this. I asked my bf to just casually ask if they got my thank you. At the very least it will make you feel better to talk to your husband about it, it did for me. But yeah I am gonna remember these days.

Edit: I’m sorry I wrote so much it’s just really bothering me. I read u/NoxWild post and it really resonated with me about people not having rituals and showing less kind gestures these days. I just want to make it clear, my issue isn’t even about the stuff or whatever. It’s the lack of support. I could really use someone to talk to and feeling the offer is rescinded is so rude. My boyfriend bought literally everything for the house used but these appliances cost him thousands of dollars and I don’t understand why there’s no gesture it feels like there’s no acknowledgment of our plan to spend our lives together. It’s not about the money or getting stuff, even the cutlery I sent the thank you note for was all used extra stuff that had been collected in their garage over the years. It’s just like in your case it’s not that you NEED flowers or a card it’s just, where is that compassion and acknowledgment. I’m sorry but it’s bullshit.

I agree with this commenter. They’re not going to be the in-laws you wanted or deserved; so the best thing you can do is manage expectations. My in-laws were the same way. Radio silence when I had significant losses, and you know what? It says a lot about them. It’s classless, and it’s not what you or I would do. Your feelings are valid, and you have every right to feel hurt that they didn’t say anything beyond platitudes. My advice is to focus on getting through this early grief the best you can. Reach out to people who were there and did show that they cared when you lost your father. That will be much more enriching and helpful than focusing on your deadbeat in-laws.

"Exactly. Reading these comments I feel like people are misinterpreting what it is OP is seeking. She has not asked or expected anything dramatic IMO.

Rather, I have a hard time understanding how people go through the burden of raising a child to adulthood (in-laws) and expecting familial ties and support to stop at 18? Like, most people do have kids (grandchild)--are they not interested in being a part of that? Are they simply not the nurturing type? I mean, I guess fair if so, but like why did they have a kid in the first place?

If the situation was something like stepmom/stepdad passed would we not expect the step children to not be a bit more sympathetic in their approach? Would saying ""sorry"" and then proceeding to talk about a TV show be acceptable? I mean it's not like it was their ACTUAL parent, right? (/s).

It's also a reciprocal relationship. I'm sure OP and her husband do things for the in-laws (or would if asked). I'm sure the grandchild will in the future as well.

Clearly, I should be more thankful for my family because we are much closer than what the standard appears to be. When my father's mother died, my mom's parents were AT the funeral. When my mother's father died, my father's dad was AT the funeral. Neither has much interaction with them directly outside of these situations, but they did it for the other people in the family (like me) who were struggling. As a grandchild, I am always picking things up at the store or mowing a lawn, etc for my grandparents. I don't even have kids so it's not with the expectation that they will be doing me favours in return, either.

Look at her husband - he can’t even be bothered to tell his parents to send her some flowers and a card. The bar is in hell.

"This is partly your brain grasping at *something* for closure. Your das died so suddenly it has left you with a bunch of unfinished emotions to work through; regrets about his passing, your distance, what this means for your own grasp of mortality, how you feel about keeping that physical distance from your mother and the rest of your family now you know how fast life can change...

The list goes on. It's a LOT. It would be a lot even if you were an old hand at grief and you and your dad weren't close, but it is and you were, so no wonder it's too much for your brain to handle all at once.

So it's redirecting to a much more familiar conflict, which is your low level of resentment with your in-laws. Would most people reach out or offer support to their daughter in law? Sure. But not everyone.

Them not doing so doesn't make them bad people. It just makes them ""not that close"" to you.

And you should not confront them over this; this is not something you want to change, is it? You don't actually want to be close to them, you just are annoyed by their actions.

What you should do instead is make your actions reflect the tone of the relationship they have set. Don't bother arranging meet ups or birthday cards for them; sure, you'll attend or sign if your husband does, but you drop the rope. Maybe when the dust is settled, reassess which family you'd rather live closer to. If one of them gets sick, tell your husband you'll take on more of the childcare so he has time to go help them, but you yourself won't be doing so.

Losing a parent is so hard, I lost my dad when my currently 19 year was a baby and I can not tell you how many milestones I wished he was here for. 

It gets different and somewhat easier as time goes on, but it never really goes entirely away. 

Also, grieving takes a while, some days I catch myself feeling perfectly fine and ok and I feel awful about it and other days I’m crying in the grocery store because my mom liked a certain kind of yogurt and I caught sight of it. 

Although I wouldn’t have liked it to be mandated by society, right after my mom died, I really wished for some sort of Victorian mourning period where everyone could see I was really fragile and being very apart from things even though life dictated that I did, in fact, need to renew my license at the DMV. 

Go easy on yourself, it’s going to come in waves, especially since you have a baby and probably don’t have time to really process for days.

"If they did know him, maybe they’re grieving too. And at their age, they have lost many friends and family, so they can be tired and sad from all the losses as well. They did expressed condolences and watched the kids for you. Maybe their love language is different. Here they seemed to have opted for act of service. Maybe in their mind that’s more important and practical than sending flowers and cards. It’s easy to just write a few words and send flowers, but it can be very hard and cost a lot more to find sudden help with childcare. Even I am not a parent but I know that. 

It feels like you overthink this, as they did what many others would do. Everyone deals with death and grief differently. Just because they didn’t deal with it the same way you expected, doesn’t mean they didn’t try. Also it’ll be healthy for you to reevaluate your expectations. From your comments you mentioned some things. But remember, they’re older and may have conditions or issues they didn’t disclose so can’t be around that much, physically or emotionally. You married the husband and decided to have kids. The in laws are really doing you favours by helping out. Don’t take that as granted. You mentioned it’s 50/50 they may help. It’s not even that bad. They do have their lives and trouble you don’t know about (maybe they don’t want to burden you, or simply don’t feel comfortable disclosing). A lot of people have a lot going on in life and not everyone shares personal struggles with others. I know you’re anger and upset (part of grieving stages) but please don’t take it out on others. By being anger, you have nothing to gain. Brining all that up hurts everyone (including yourself, your husband and kids) and benefits no one. Even if your anger is justified (I’m not saying it is), what is more important is that do not do anything destructive and you may regret later.

"I completely agree that they should have sent a note and a floral tribute and made a personal condolence call to your mother and to you.  Even if they did not think of him as a personal *friend,* it would have been respectful and gracious for them to acknowledge your loss.

May I share something that occurred when my spouse died?  My spouse had three living siblings.  None of them lived in the same area where we lived.  I'd met them in a very few social circumstances.  None of them called me or sent a card or even an email or a text.  Nothing.  Complete radio silence.  About a week afterwards, one of them called and asked me to send them some items that belonged to my spouse that they now wanted.  That was the *only* interaction I had with my deceased spouse's family.

I was somewhat stunned by what (at the time) seemed like unbelievable detachment.  Now, years later, I realize that this kind of courtesy did not exist in their family.  They just didn't have any experience with death rituals, except for maybe showing up at a funeral, if it was held locally.

I remembered I'd had to demonstrate to my spouse the common acknowledgements a regular polite person makes when a death occurs.  

I don't know if that helps you at all.  Maybe I'm completely off base.  But I do know that as I get older, I see fewer people making an effort to help the bereaved, or even acknowledge a death.

"OP, you just have to realize that their family is very different from yours.  It sounds like you're from different parts of the country, so it might just be a culture clash.  Or some people are just rude, or thoughtless.  Not even thoughtless in an asshole way -- but like they just don't think of anyone else.  Like it doesn't occur to them to think of someone else.  It's insane to me.  

I'm southern.  My Husband is a yankee.  His parents are weird.  They're not assholes at ALL, I love them -- but they're weird.  And he didn't realize that until he moved away and was like wait a minute ... 

Just complete opposite ends of the spectrum.  You have poor southeners on my side and upper middle class yankees on his.  Just no, we're a 180 from each other.  I'm Blessed that my in laws are very nice and have accepted me as a daughter.  I'm sorry that you have not had the same luck.  

Like my people would be sending flowers, calling, taking your kid against your will because you need rest, making lasagnas, organizing food trains, mowing your yard.  Not everybody is like that.  And it's a hard pill to swallow when you expect that and you want that.  And I'm sorry.    

You married your husband and it sounds like your marriage is going well.  Is having great in laws even close to a deal breaker?  If not, don't stir this pot.  Just give up.  Maybe even move closer to your own family.  Or just pretend like your in laws live somewhere else.  

You say you've been trying so hard.  Stop it.  They don't care.  They don't want your efforts.  Be it because they're weird, antisocial, assholes, or they don't like you.  For some reason, it's not happening and you can't make it happen.  Trying to make it happen is making it worse because you're getting your feelings hurt more and more continuously.  

Sometimes you have to let people go -- or more rudely put -- give up on them.  You'll never change them.  You can't control what they do.  You can't control what your husband does and how he interacts with them.  The only thing you can control is YOURSELF.  How do you let this affect you?  For your own mental health, you need to erase them from your emotional life.  

Like my father.  Screw him.  Once I found out he had been staying IN MY CITY and didn't even let me know or say hi much less stop by for lunch or something.  What the FING FK?  So I just don't expect anything from him.  I haven't for years.  It has simplified my life immensely.  We talk on birthdays and Christmas, most Thanksgivings.  That's it.  And when other family is complaining about his insanity -- I just remind them -- what did you even expect? 

Stop expecting anything from these people.  Release them from your life.  I would also try to not insert yourself into the relationship your husband has with them unless it is negatively affecting you or your children.  That's his business.  Apparently, they don't want it to be yours so F 'em.  Let them fend for themselves.  

Pretend they don't exist and carry on.  Anything they do do is just like bonus sprinkles from Heaven that you never expected and are under no obligation to repay.  Stop asking them for help, they don't want to give it.  And if they talk bad about you, that's not your business.  You can't stop them.  

Forget them.  They live far far far far away in delulu land.  

I'm so sorry for your fathers passing.  My mother passed in 2020 unexpectedly (yeah, in the hospital with Covid -- but she had been recovering and expected to come home -- then boom, dead on Christmas morning).   I am in NO WAY over it.  And I'm very sensitive about it.  Like when I say she died from Covid, sometimes my husband will correct me and say it wasn't covid.  OH YEAH?  IF SHE DIDN'T HAVE COVID AND THE HOSPITAL WASN'T OVERWHELMED FROM THE APOCOLYPSE, THEY'D HAVE NOTICED SHE WASN'T MOVING ENOUGH AND MAYBE SHE WOULDN'T HAVE DIED FROM A BLOOD CLOT -- WHICH ARE COMMON WITH COVID.

See how angry I just got there?  Cause like anything about my moms death is extremely sensitive.  It's the same with your father.  Yes, everyone who knew your father should have sent flowers and notes and texted you funny pictures they had of him with a nice memory attached.  You're extremely sensitive right now about this topic and will continue to be.  They did you wrong.  But you should have expected nothing from them because they should be dead to you emotionally.  

If they had been dead to you emotionally you'd have seen them spending a measly hour watching their freaking grandson so you could pack for an EMERGENCY to fly across the country due to a tragic unexpected death -- well you'd not have counted on or expected that so it would have just been a bonus you didn't even have to thank them for.

"Generally speaking, you’ll be less sad about their lack of engaging if you let go of those expectations for any future interaction. 

The only reason to have an issue with in laws is if they’re directly rude to you or do things to upset your husband. Otherwise there’s no reason to expect them to be more involved now than they previously have - which sounds like not much.

People have different families. Be guided by your husband on what he expects from them. He knows how they traditionally “show up” or don’t. You can have your expectations based on that.

That said, it’s fair to be sad. Grief sucks. And your feelings won’t come out in logical or even “fair” ways. Focus on what you need right now."	Apocalypsze	reply	na	na	na	0.9983779191970825	no	no	no	na	relationships

Also might help to frame the lack of flowers or a card at your Dad's funeral as them likely barely knowing him.

"It's possible that they are just feeling really awkward and don't know how to say anything. 

Eg, if they sent a card/ flowers, that would feel ""wrong"" because you're family; but if they say something, they are at risk of you being emotional in a way they can't handle. 

A lot of the time people mess up these situations, because they are not sure of the right thing to do, so they do nothing. 

If you look at it this way, you might find it more forgivable that they dropped the ball. Also keep in mind if you are in a vulnerable situation in the future (eg if you get really sick) make sure you spell out in clear language how they can do the right thing.

"It totally depends on the family. Some familes aren't close either. And when someone dies, everyone responds differently. I never send flowers because when I've lost someone I get a huge amount of flowers and they're hard to deal with and don't help anything. 

I also didn't hear from a LOT of people when I lost a family member. There isn't a code to go by. If you're close to that person, and were there when they got a call, a card would seem really cold and impersonal. (Cards are also cultural. Some people send them as a rule. Other people think it's a nice but pointless courtesy). 

People send food, but then some people know you get tons of food when someone dies so purposefully don't send food. 

I personally almost went mad from all the phone calls, and would avoid calling someone going through a loss. I'd stick to text that they can answer in their own time.

So I’ve uncovered the cheating in a previous post and have decided to end it. How do you move on from that? It ended pretty amicably, we still live together but I’m moving out in a couple of months.

"It's important to remember that it's the trust being broken that is the problem here, not the actual independent act of him sleeping with someone else - there are relationships where that is compeltely fine if everyone is in the know. You were not, and that is an incredibly big thing to be deceptive about. To say that distrust will bleed into other areas that you never showed distrust in towards him before is an understatement. It's too much. 
How do you move on? I think it's important that you redefine self-worth to yourself and learn to be happy on your own before you do anything else. You will find love again one day, I promise, but the last thing you want to do is bring in the ghosts of your previous relationship to haunt your new partner(s). 
Remember you are worthy of someone who is honest and respectful. One thing that may be helpful is to make a list of everything that you love about yourself. If that's too difficult, because people often struggle with this, then make a list of every reason why someone would be lucky to have you in their life. People often find it easier to talk themselves up from the prospective of someone else. It doesn't even have to be for romantic reasons - you can also answer from the perspectives of friends or colleagues or all of the above.

"Listen to book called: **Leave a Cheater, Gain a Life.** It has great tips on what to do, how to move on, how to have right mentality about the cheating and why they cheated. It's best to get it from audible (or other places where you can listen someone read it) and just.. listen.

And yeah me and many from r/survivinginfidelity have been there too. Unfortunately in most cases a cheater will cheat again even how remorseful they are.

It just took about 6kk months to realize how much I had given and how many dreams and hopes I had decided to give up just to support his dream or how he would have never given me a chance to have these dreams (like owning a small house next to a lake since he didn't work for 10 years!)"	pricklypear313	reply	na	na	na	0.9987791180610657	no	no	no	na	relationships
I don’t think it’s worth the headache. You’re always going to be worrying if he’s cheating whenever he doesn’t answer his phone or you don’t know where he is.

He cheated on you because he didn't want to be with you. He is remorseful because he made you feel bad and couldn't have told you he didn't want to be with you. But now since you found out, you can end it instead of him. He doesn't want yo he with you and if he did he wouldn't have cheated.	pricklypear313	reply	na	na	na	0.9987791180610657	weak	no	no	na	relationships
"Missing a lot of information like how long have you been together, did he confess, what has he done to show remorse?

If this is a new relationship, why stay after he has shown you who he is? Being happy about a break up? No, no one is happy about that, but rather grateful you found out when you did before you had years invested and tangled lives.

Because you're both gonna constantly try to get back at one another while in your presence either in a good way or a bad way. 

Also the healing process gonna take twice as long while the Hate/Forgiveness process is gonna thrive twice as long.

FACT is, you CANT break up with someone and still live together. It doesn't work like that.

Thank you so very much for this. I definitely know I wasn’t the problem because that’s absolutely not fair. In another post I have the full story but we communicated well (I thought) and always said if there’s an area he’s unhappy in, talk to me and we can work it out. Now he’s saying it’s definitely not my fault at all and I was perfect etc but he just needed extra validation. (It was all online cheating. Sexting etc. no meeting up but still just as bad). So yes. You’re right. I need to focus on loving myself now because although I know it’s not my fault, I feel like an idiot for loving him and giving him all of me.	pricklypear313	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9987791180610657	strong	strong	no	na	relationships

"Absolutely. And it's awesome that you are not turning against yourself because that's so easy to do. The common, ""What's wrong with me?"" Spiral is something I am definitely familiar with, and it came in waves after my ex of 5 years and I broke up - only for me to find out 2 days later that he was dating someone else. It can be tempting in these situations to crumble. Hell, I still get angry sometimes when I think about what I was willing to put up with back in the day. But, at the end of the day, you're not an idiot for having integrity and loyalty and love for someone else. It's a beautiful thing that you were able to dedicate that to another person, even if things didn't work out, and even if they did something(s) that made them less worthy to receive that love from you.

Thank you 😊 I didn’t move over for him but he knows I have literally no one here so either way it was a dog act.

I guess it’s literally just waiting to move on. You know. Because I didn’t want it to be like this so the dumb love goggles get in the way but whenever I think back to anything lovey, it’s tainted by what I know was going on in the background. And now suddenly it’s a case of him needing validation. I was giving enough but he just needed more from other sources. So it’s just making it easier for me to be like… you know what. Work on yourself. Not ONCE has he even suggested „if we work it out I promise to do this and this and this etc“ it’s just „I don’t want to lose you and I know you can’t trust me but I couldn’t have you bringing it up all the time or searching my phone etc so idk how it would move forward.“ like how about you look to yourself and not me. Grrrr so frustrating. I just want to be moved on and not hanging on to the remnants of a tainted relationship.	pricklypear313	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9987791180610657	no	strong	no	na	relationships
"YES! Oh my God the lack of accountability is always the worst part in these situations. Hopefully he can one day dig deeper. Okay, he needed more validation - why? Where does that come from? What is responsible for that? But, no, instead he turns it into, ""I know you'll never trust me again"" instead of looking at why that is. Ugh. Men. I'm not saying he is a bad dude. Good people do bad things sometimes and they have no idea why. But, I hope he one day realizes and does the work on himself to be better. It's been almost 8 years since my ex and I broke up, and from what I hear (I don't ask - my friends just think it's comical lol), he has not learned a single thing. He spiraled further down the rabbit hole and hasn't been able to hold down a relationship for longer than a year since. Their burdens are not our responsibility. You're free, girl. Stay strong!

"

Idk why but I (29) just had a feeling about my bf (37) cheating on me but I think confirmed it just now. My bf and I has been dating for almost 2 years now but things are not the same as it used to be. No major issues, it’s just the things he do and I do are changing for whatever reason. But I’ve noticed that when I try to come on to him for sex, he wasn’t as sexual or aroused, it’s almost like he’s forcing it. And this was about 2 weeks ago. 

Now I’ve found some deleted hidden purchases on his phone and not sure what to think of it. I don’t know anything about hidden purchases at all so I’m not sure if you’ve deleted the app and it’s still under hidden purchases, iPhone will keep a copy of it in there and keep the newest version? I saw grindr, jackd, surge, etc in there with the newest version but I wanted to make sure that i have the concrete evidence that he downloaded it recently and not apple doing it automatically. If I find out that he downloaded the apps recently then it will be the end of our relationship.

TL;DR: caught my bf having hidden dating app purchases on his phone."	Regular-krispy-kream	post	39.99682789139932	male	White	0.9970641732215881	na	na	na	3	relationships

"TL;DR: title

I’ve known my bf for about 9 years, but didn’t become friends until a few years after. We met through a mutual friend and were long distance, but talked in the same group chats until about 6 years ago, when we realized we had a lot in common. Then 3 years ago we got close during the pandemic (still long distance), 2 years ago we admitted we were in love with each other, moved in together shortly after (had 2 separate trial week periods to test the waters) and have been together since. 
 
Neither of us is perfect, but we’ve both improved each other in healthy ways. I’ve started standing up for myself more and gained more confidence, he’s gotten out of his shell a little and is learning to socialize better (which I never force). But I do think he’s on the spectrum. I don’t care - I love him for who he is, and if who he is is a guy with autism, that doesn’t change anything. But I do want to be supportive.

Disclaimer: This is a hunch! I’ve worked with special needs/behavioral needs kids for years, but mostly with ADHD, ODD, or criminal history. Autism isn’t my specialty. So please forgive me if I’m wrong, and correct me so I learn. But this is why I think he may be autistic:

1. SEVERELY socially ignorant and solitary. I mean it took us years to get close, but he also avoids social situations almost entirely (I never force or cajole him, but always offer) and is often blunt, which can be hurtful. He’s stung me a few times but we talk it out and I believe him when he says his intent was never to hurt, but it’s difficult for him to “sugar coat.” He always apologizes and makes a genuine effort to never repeat the offense, with some slips but like I said, he’s *genuinely* trying. He also points out small imperfections/flaws, like if someone has a blemish he will just straight-up tell them if he has to interact (not strangers… coworkers, his few friends, or me).

2. Obsessive hobby/interest (it’s too obvious to state it here in case he sees, so I’ll just say Dracula). Like almost every movie in multiple formats, tons of figures and posters, books, graphic novels, etc.

3. Very into his routine. Refuses to call off work even if he’s sick, which is rare, but still. Has to be essentially forced to use his vacation time (use it or lose it). He doesn’t even care about his job, it’s just a paycheck but it’s easy for him, pays well, and he said he basically gets left alone all day. He got a new boss who is kind, but likes to socialize and he’s expressed how anxious and uncomfortable it makes him feel. Also, the other day we planned to go for a swim, but it was raining, so I suggested we walk around the mall instead (it’s virtually deserted). He said he had been mentally prepared to go to the pool, not the mall, and didn’t feel comfortable making the change. I thought it was such a small change but he got noticeably uncomfortable and told me so, so we stayed home instead.

4. He isn’t very emotional. I’ve seen more come out since living in together, he is loving and affectionate, I think since I’m a “safe” person, but when he met my family he was very monotone, barely said a word, and kept great distance. My family thinks he was being rude but I know he was just very uncomfortable and anxious, explained it, and they did their best to include him in small ways he could handle. He still said it stressed him out, not because he was intimidated by meeting some of my family, but because he dreads socializing with new people.

5. Gonna emphasize the social aspect again. Often interrupts and over talks, prefers to talk than listen (though has worked on these things and improved a lot), will tell someone he “doesn’t care” if he doesn’t find the conversation stimulating, doesn’t value things like celebrating Valentine’s Day or Easter because he doesn’t understand the point. He participates in Christmas and Thanksgiving, and lets me spoil him for his birthday because it makes me happy (he treats me very well for mine, too), so I let some holidays “go” so as not to torture him.

?: He’s asexual. Tried it with 2 different partners in college, didn’t like it, doesn’t want it. Affectionate, likes snuggles and kisses, but no PIV, oral, hand, etc. (Yes, this is fine with me.) I know not all aces are autistic, but with the other potential indicators, I thought it might be worth mentioning.

I’m doing my best to be supportive. We’ve talked about it a little and if he’s thought about getting diagnosed, but he said he didn’t think a diagnosis would be helpful in any way and we changed the subject. He’s my person and we love each other, I just want to make sure I’m going about things the right way and if I should encourage him to get diagnosed or continue leaving it alone. Thanks!"

"Let me turn this around: what do *you* think would change for him if he had a diagnosis?

I have personally found mine incredibly helpful, but ""why am I so different"" (or, honestly, ""why is the world so weird and illogical"") was a question eternally burning in my chest, and that was a (partial) answer.  It fulfilled a need I have.  What need do you see him possibly (or definitely) having that would be answered by knowing if autism was a factor for him?"

"I have been talking to this guy I like and he sent me a TikTok saying “me after telling women online to get back in the kitchen” but the video was men cooking in the kitchen. I definitely took it the wrong way because in the past this guy has followed a certain misogynistic influencer that got arrested,  but now said he doesn’t like him and never did. He is also pretty religious and said he doesn’t agree with liberal ideas etc. Anyway I sent a TikTok back saying “men used to go to war and hunt and now they unsend dms when you don’t reply”. I sort of did it as a retaliation. I then started a discussion about feminism and misogyny, and asked if he considers himself to be either of the two. Anyway I think I dragged out the feminism discussion a bit because it sounded like he was defending the influencer, although he said he wasn’t. Basically he said that the women who claimed the influencer assaulted them fabricated the evidence, which I couldn’t find when I searched it online so we ended up debating for a bit. I also said I don’t like misogynistic jokes as a response to the video he sent me. Also, the other day I told him I don’t want to do like sexual things because I’ve only met him once (a year ago) and we just started talking recently (for a week). I did send him a TikTok about a town that was named after something sexual and he responded saying he wants to see me in that town playing sleeping etc. So I thought he was sexualising me and got annoyed since twice I have told him I’m not comfortable with this stuff and he still feels like a stranger to me. I did call him weird for it and I feel really bad about it. Does any of this sound like I’m being too overly emotional, intense or toxic? Should I apologise?

Your intention of being considerate and caring for his feelings is admirable, but your actions followed your feelings and intention to be considerate, and that's  great! Since you like him, I'm sure you want to be seen as favorable in his eyes, but remember you also have to maintain and upkeep your values as you stood up for your position in those heated conversations. Your thoughts and feelings should be respected, and you made those clear in your conversation with him. If you want to have a relationship with someone but you share a difference of opinions then then each person must be able to share their option and be respected. It's seems like you two are working on that balance as you learn more about each other. Just make sure to keep respect for yourself and respect for the other upfront and share that feeling with him as well. You can also share your feelings of being conflicted about the convo with him to get a better understanding of his perspective.

"I’ve been with my girlfriend for the past 2 years. A year into our relationship I was hanging around her hometown group of friends she sees a handful of times during the year. 
The first meeting with them didn’t go great. The reason might be because of this. the group involves a guy she made out and fondled with in the past. She told me about this ex guy and at my first initial meeting with them when he was not there my face went sour when they were talking ab him and they noticed that. This might be the reason why they don’t like me is because of my uncomfortableness with him being around. The whole group knows about my uncomfortableness about him and they might hate me for that. there’s clear boundaries they don’t hang out one on one or don’t really talk/text outside of group scenarios 


I have been nothing but respectful to this group of friends and one time while we were on vacation playing cards with her friend group,  one of her friends says in another language that I didn’t understand that she doesn’t like me in front of me and the rest of her friends, who understand the language.   

This same girl would step on the back of my shoes when we walk and did it multiple times and would grin at me when I looked back so she deliberately was doing it. My gf confronted this girl and told her how disrespectful it was and that she can never do this again, in regards to the talking in another language incident.

In this same friend group her female cousin’s bf exists too. He always make passive aggressive jabs at me and asks me if “i’m happy to be in a relationship” and he said in front of me and my gf that “I don’t seem too happy to be dating her” even though that’s not even the case. He says this pretty much every time i’ve met them so like 4 times total. Keep in mind i’ve only met them 4 times. My gf just brushes off these jabs and she clearly sees her friends as people who can do no wrong 

After that first incident with the girl expressing her dislike to me to my face in another language i can’t understand in front of everyone, I told her that I don’t want to hang out with them. I also explained the jabs the other friend makes and I told her i don’t want to be around people who disrespect me like that. I set the expectation that I would not hang out with her friend group at casual outings but if they happen to be at her birthday, graduation, or a bigger event then i will be there as I am there to support/ celebrate her and couldn’t give two shits if her friends are there. She agreed to this expectation 9 months ago. 

She is on vacation now with a few people in that group and I obviously didn’t go because of the previous incidents. She is tipsy and she told me that me” loves me fucking alot” but not hanging out with her friends is a dealbreaker for her and basically went against what she previously agreed to. Am I being too harsh by not hanging out with her friends anymore due to these incidents even though they are clearly so disrespectful to me?  Am I in the right for standing my ground and not allowing her to change my “boundaries” on this even though she explicitly said this is a dealbreaker now ?  Would you do the same thing I did and no longer hang out with her friends after they constantly disrespect you ?

Apologies for the long post.
So some background on my mom and my family. My mom is a classic narcissist who doesn't think they're a narcissist. She only thinks about herself, constantly berates my dad as well as me and my siblings (we're all adults now in our 20s and 30s), has a major shopping addiction, and is just basically not a nice person to be around. My dad is only still with her because he doesn't want to burden any of us kids with her if he left, because she's had him taking care of her for so long she basically doesn't know how to take care of herself. She's had health problems almost my whole life, cancer then nerve damage and digestive issues due to her doctors over doing it on chemo. She's always been unpleasant but it's just gotten worse as she's gotten older and was dealing with her health. And her being sick for so long is a big part of why I've avoided conflict with her and have kept my opinions to myself. She's relatively healthy now,  has been for the last several years but the narcissistic and toxic behavior is worse than ever. 

Anyways, I've been with my boyfriend for 10 years. We're happy with our relationship, don't want to get married. The problem is, my mom doesn't like him. And I have no idea why. She's a hard person to like, but for years he's been polite to her. Has held his tongue everytime she's said something hurtful to me or my dad. He's helped my parents move, has helped move my grandparents (my mom's parents) into my parents house when they weren't able to take care of themselves. Helped me and my parents take care of them, which included verbal abuse from my granddad as his cancer and slight dementia got bad, helped feed, bathe and change my grandma's diapers because she had several alzheimers. He did more for my grandparents than my mom did and those were her parents and were only living in my parents house because my mom refused to put them in assisted living, which is what my grandparents had said they wanted when they were still healthy because they didn't want to be a burden. 
But for some reason my mom doesn't like him. Has even told me she doesn't consider him ""husband/father material"". After I told my boyfriend about that, he's stopped trying to be nice to her. 
But he broke down to me after they stayed with us for a weekend while they were in town. He's upset that she doesn't consider him family. He's never a thought when my parents are planning vacations and want me to come. His feelings and opinions are never considered about holidays or basically anything. 
The whole family, me especially, don't usually disagree with her because it always gets blown way out of proportion and we just don't want to deal with her. But obviously this needs to change because I need to figure out why she doesn't like my boyfriend and tell her she needs to treat him like family because he's the person I've chosen to spend my life with. And if she makes me choose between her and my boyfriend, I'm going to choose him because he's not the one who always makes me feel miserable and isn't a terrible person . 
I need advice on how to have this conversation. I'm not a confrontational person at all and have basically let her steamroll me my entire life because I don't want to deal witb a fight. But this behavior can't continue. I don't want her in my life if she continues to behave this way. Unfortunately this is going to make my dad's life harder than it is already, but I just need to have this conversation.

Tldr: how do I tell my narcissist mom that she needs to start treating my partner of 10 years like he's part of the family and that I don't want her in my life if she can't?"	kel330	post	21.109806104424113	female	White	0.9979661703109741	na	na	na	2	relationships

> The whole family, me especially, don't usually disagree with her because it always gets blown way out of proportion and we just don't want to deal with her.

You know she counts on that right? You all have so totally given up and she KNOWS she can abuse you and get away with it every damn time she wants. She's ""rocking the boat"" on purpose to force to you try to steady the boat. And the pressure from everyone else to help keep the boat steady is reinforcing that attitude. The way to deal with this is to let the boat rocker rock the boat. I'm particularly fond of [this point of view](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/). 

&#x200B;

>I need to figure out why she doesn't like my boyfriend

Nope. The reason she doesn't like him is 100% irrelevant because even if you got a straight answer out of her, she won't listen to reason and she won't change her mind. Anything you tell her to try to ""counter"" her opinion will just be fuel for her to come up with yet another reason to not like him. That is not a fight you will ever, ever win.

&#x200B;

>and tell her she needs to treat him like family because he's the person I've chosen to spend my life with. And if she makes me choose between her and my boyfriend, I'm going to choose him because he's not the one who always makes me feel miserable and isn't a terrible person

Yup. The thing is, this will cause an argument. Period. It's going to ""rock the boat"". If I had to guess, even though you're solidly into adulthood, she still mentally sees you as the child she raised. As the diaper wearing baby that she had to change. As the toddler that she had to tell ""don't touch the stove"". As the middle schooler that she had to say ""do your homework"". And as the teenager that had a hard time dealing with teenage angst. To her, you're still a ""kid"" that she has to tell what to do and when to do it. You couldn't possibly be an adult who is in charge of their own life.

And yet, that's a fact that she needs to learn. Unfortunately, it may take a period of no or low contact to drive that point home. Among other things she needs to hear is this:

*Mom, I may be YOUR child, but I am no longer A child. I'm an adult, fully capable of making adult decisions. You need to respect my decisions and if you can't, then our relationship is going to suffer.*

I might follow it up immediately with something like this:

*My boyfriend is the person I choose to live my life with right now. He IS my family. He IS my chosen partner. He IS a serious part of my life. If you want to include me in something family related, you will either include him, or you can count me out. We're a matched set and if he's not welcome, then I'm going to assume I'm not welcome either.*

&#x200B;

>I'm not a confrontational person at all

This is the worst part of it. I grew up as a non-confrontational person. I almost lost my wife because of it. Fortunately, she managed to impress on me the need to stop playing peace keeper and start protecting the people I want to spend my life with. It was rough for well over a year when I started standing up to my mom. I kept standing up to her though and it's much better now. I also have no regrets and am actually REALLY happy I did what I did.

If you take nothing else from my comment, please take this: playing peace keeper never works in the end. Stop playing the part of ballast and trying to steady the boat. It will never work in the end. Instead, work up the courage to tell her to stop rocking the boat or to suffer the consequences which may include low/no contact."	kel330	reply	na	na	na	0.9979661703109741	no	strong	no	na	relationships

Im not indian but i do come from a place where these kind of things are also strict with parents. What i would do is if you havent,try hanging out with her, even if neither of you confess your feelings for eachother, it would still be better than not interacting which could result in both of you losing your feelings for eachother. Hanging out with her will also give both of you chances to develope even stronger feelings. And if she doesnt have feelings for you then this will also be your chance to make her like you.

Also dont let her be the only thing on your mind (big mistake I made) you might think that its okay because you love her, but dont do that. Spend time with your friends, do well in school and most importantly make her see that you have your s**t together. Balance is key dont go for too much academics and dont go for too much lovelife.

"My girlfriend and I have now been together for almost 3 years. For the first two years it felt like we were madly in love and could not keep away from each-other - she used to obsess over me and be jealous of every encounter with any other girl I had and I liked that because it made me feel cared about.

I have always wanted to spend my life with her. I would share anything and everything of mine and would even give my life to save hers. And I think this is becoming a problem.

We are both currently on separate holidays with our parents. Prior to leaving we had a conversation about specifically how she's upset because she feels as though I love her than she loves me - she was crying about it and incredibly upset. I told her that it's okay for relationships to be 80-20 sometimes as long as they average out to 50-50 over time. This conversation is what made me begin to feel incredibly strong love for her because I realised that I am replaceable and that this seemingly unconditional and strong love I thought she had for me may not be forever. It's a situation where you don't realise what you have until you lose it - but I have not yet officially lost anything.

I write here to seek some personal advice to help me grow as a person. Not just for the sake of my relationship (which is all I have apart from my two parents) but also for the sake of me. What if she leaves me? I am so attached and in love that I don't know what I would do without her.

I care too much about her and I'm incredibly insecure that she might find someone better. What advice would you give me, as a 17 year old, to stop feeling things so deeply? I'm sure that if my love for her died down a little she would be less sad and I would be less sad and everything would be so much better.

tl;dr: I 17M feel too deeply about my girlfriend that it is causing both of us sadness and I am looking for advice to better myself, for the sake of the relationship - but also very much for the sake of myself too.

"Love is not quanitifable. And it ebbs and flows, think of it as a seesaw you are both on. I understand not wanting to lose your gf, you are young and at this stage in the relationship it is very normal to be this attached. I personally think of love as a yes or no question and that is all that matters in a relationship. Doesn't matter who loves who more, what matters is you both love each other. Do you know how rare that is to find? 

I do not see anything going wrong with your relationship because of this tbh, seems like one of those extremely dumb things that couples argue about for a few days before putting a stop to the conversation and never thinking of it again. But yes, nothing is guaranteed and your relationship could end someday and that is a hard pill to swallow. Doesn't mean it will, dw. But there is the possibility for all of us out here. Butnworrying about the future will notnhelp your relationship right now, especially since you cannot predit or control anything.

For your own sake I suggest growing yourself alongside the relationship and prioritising other aspects of your life- hobbies, people, etc. It is important to not lose yourself in the relationship and it is better for the relationship in the long run too. Don't make her your everything, always make sure you both can exist as individuals and as partners.

"It’s the nature of being 17 to feel love really intensely, don’t try to scale it back so it’s even-stevens! It can’t really be measured, so there’s not a reliable way to know “who loves who more” and it’s a competition where nobody will win. Let it be. 

It’s not necessarily a bad thing to have intense love at this age — it’s a combo of hormones, learning who you are through romantic interactions, and trying out different personas in a way — we’re very easily influenced creatures as humans and a lot of the romantic models we see can shape our own interactions. Parents, friends, even movie/book/TV characters all play a part in our dynamics with our early partners. 

My advice is to remember to take time for each of you as individuals. Encourage her to go out with other friends to see a movie, or whatever activities she likes. Same for you — foster interests outside of each other. Obsessive love as teens is very normal and healthy, but you need to make sure that it doesn’t become the only thing driving your life.

"I remember feeling emotions super strongly when I was your age for my boyfriend at the time. Having gotten older and gone through breakups and dating other people before being with my current person, I don't discount those strong feelings that I had then because I was deeply in love at that time. 

I feel like when you're at the beginning of your life and all experiences are brand new, your feelings tend to be overwhelming because you have no context to compare things as it's your first time experiencing them. My first breakup was devastating and kept me up crying all night. Ultimately I realized it was a good thing as we were compatible while I was in high school, but going to college exposed a nasty and controlling side that I hadn't acknowledged before. 

This is not to say that your relationship won't last, there are plenty of people who marry their high school sweethearts. Time has shown me that all things end, good or bad. Some connections end due to circumstances, growing apart as you mature, disagreement on fundamental values, betrayal, etc. Some people remain together until one person passes away. Most of us have to unlearn things that are ultimately harmful to relationships. Our connections teach us the lessons that we need to learn and shape us for the future. 

The hardest part of any relationship (romantic, friendship, parental, professional, etc) to me is communication. Ensuring that you are clearly communicating without hurting your partners feelings, and keeping them in the loop on what's happening with you ensures your connection remains strong. I think it's good that you're acknowledging how the intensity of your emotions may be having a negative effect. Think of it like cupping a baby bird in your hand, if you squeeze it too hard, you know how it'll end up.

"Something I've learnt - feeling more attached at fear (or after) losing something isn't really 'love', it's a whole bundle of other emotions caused in a large part by insecurity. That you need that thing or person to validate you and your worth, that longing for the comfort of the familiar, the anxiety of the unknown. Those are all powerful emotions, and it's very easy to conflate that yearning in your heart with love, but they aren't the same thing. 

Love is what you feel in the boring moments. When nothing else is going on, there's no excitement, passion or sadness, and you just look at or think of your person and smile. Not because they are hot, or because they represent safety and warmth, or because they make you feel all kinds of ways. Just because their very being is so beautiful to you.

I don't doubt you feel this way about your girlfriend, I just think it's important to separate the anxieties you said made you feel like you love her 'more' from the love itself. Because it's not the love you want to go away, it's the anxiety.

You do this by improving your self esteem and by making sure your life outside of your girlfriend is as full as possible. If she is where you get all your socialisation, your emotional support, and your confidence, then feeling like you might lose her will naturally be catastrophic. So you have to find those things elsewhere, through friends, hobbies, and self reflection. Build yourself up to being a complete human being on your own, so that if you did break up, you will be hurt, but you won't feel like you've lost everything that makes life worthwhile. 

The idea that people are supposed to complete each other is one that breeds codependency, and that's not healthy for either party. You should both be full humans independently, that add extra to each others lives instead of filling a missing piece. That doesn't mean you can't support each other when the other is struggling, but you should always be striving to get to a stage where you don't NEED each other, but CHOOSE each other. That avoids you putting unnecessary strain on your partner, having them feel like they only exist because of what they can give you instead of who they are, and it avoids you feeling so much anxiety over them not being around.

Basically, you need to get to the stage where the answer to 'what would I do without her' is easily answerable. You'd be devastated, but you'd be alright. Because you are with her because you love her, not because you need her."	boris246	reply	na	na	na	0.0032055687624961138	no	strong	no	na	relationships

"These feelings are common and youre not alone. However it seems you are hinting at signs of co-depencency and you admitted to feeling insecure about your relationship. Those are warning signs to me. 

How is your relationship with your parents? Are you able to come to them with your issues? Do you talk daily about life events with them? Do you feel your parents meet your needs and standards you set for them (within reason)?

 I am concerned about your co-dependency and insecurity issues and one of the main ways these issues arise is from missing elements in ones caretaker relationship, particuarly earlier in their age. It could also be a particuarly adverse situation or period of time in your life.

You have great insight and seem to be aware of your what your partner needs and deserves in the relationship.

"37M ... ***lots*** of relationship experience

You're not going to want to hear this but ... chances of her being your last love are almost non-existent. You should be taking this time to enjoy what experiences you may share and learn more about yourself, as it applies to matters of the heart. If it pans out the way you want (right now), great. But for now, the only future you should be thinking about is your own. How are you going to be the man she, or *any* woman WANTS when you're 20? 30? Nearly 40 (like myself)? Don't worry about improving her life. Improve yours, and whomever you're with will benefit alongside you.

That said, how can you make this relationship better/last? You can't, really. You can only be yourself. And if that's not enough, better to find that out sooner rather than later. I've learned that ""overdoing"" it on the love/affection front can do more harm than good. It sounds romantic but it tends to trigger the opposite reaction than what you're looking for. Relax. Chill. Let her come to you. You don't have to always be agreeable, but you do have to always mean what you say. Find what you love about life or yourself, outside of her. Be excited about it. Be, YOU, fully. She'll gravitate to that more than a bouquet of roses and chocolates every week. Be a little mysterious. You shouldn't ALWAYS be accessible. You need to have some business outside of her. Whether thats hobbies, work (you're very young so this doesn't count), or social, you need your own space, as does she. But she shouldn't be a part of every action or thought you have. Let her wonder (not in a bad way)."	boris246	reply	na	na	na	0.0032055687624961138	weak	no	no	na	relationships

"If you grew up in war and witnessed 3 of your friends die, would it change you?

What if,

You were diagnosed with leukemia and had Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and your treatmant was 2 years long and due to covid you could only have 1 visitor per day?

Nobody texted you, Nobody Visits you.

What is my point?

Theres no love without pain. You can only truly appreciate what love is when you experience a tragedy first. 

How can you say you love someone when all you do is go on Vacations, go to restaurants and drink ice cream all day? 

Love is when the women stays by your side when you lost your job and isnt nagging you in the process.

Love is when you are sick with an illness and she continues to be with you and doesnt leave you for someone else.

You may ""feel"" love but that is a very feminine way of looking at love.

Based on post and replies you made, she’s warning you that the relationship has become imbalanced and your feminine qualities are pushing her to be more masculine i.e, she’s gonna be more focused on her life than on a person. As a man you have to maintain the balance in the relationship and fight the urge to chase her away. You obviously miss her feminine, caring, overly sweet, borderline anxious attachment and so you’re acting in that manner, just as she’s acting more masculine and detached because that’s how she wants you to act.	boris246	reply	na	na	na	0.0032055687624961138	no	no	no	na	relationships
It’s a young love and now she is growing out of it. Both of you may start to realize there’s other ppl out there and other connections to be made. I can tell by your other comments that she is at that point of starting to want to explore. This is what most young ppl do. But if you cling to her you will only push her further away. You clinging to her signals that you have nothing going on for yourself other her. You signal to her that she is the center of your world but as we mature that becomes unattractive. Ppl need space to breathe and be individuals in relationships. Like everyone else suggested you need a life outside of this. Hobbies: this is the PERFECT time to start lifting weights.

Take a breath young man, it's all going to be ok. When it comes to love, especially at your age it's very pure because it's new. The feelings are strongest especially for your 1st love, she'll always be with you. Key thing here is learning disciple and self control. Love can swing both ways the highs and the lows. 3 years is a very long time, especially when you're 15-17. I'll never say don't express yourself but maybe consider how you express these feelings and how often. It's hard not to get stuck in the volatility of these feelings but maybe find someone else to talk to avoid them.

"The first thing you need to do is NEVER, EVER think she could find ""someone better."" There is no one better, you are perfectly fine as you.

Loving people is a good thing, but if you love someone to the point where you feel like they are the only thing you have in life then you need to make some changes. Not saying that the relationship needs to end, but you sound like you need to find other things in your life that you can focus on and find passion in. Do you have any hobbies or things you like to do without your GF sometimes? It’s important for people to experience life outside of a relationship, especially at your age. It’s good to spend time with your significant other, but too much time can also lead to an unhealthy dependency for one another. I suggest having some “me time” every now and then. Like at least once a week plan something to do by yourself. Like trying new hobbies and such. And maybe make time for friends another time in the week without your GF. Some time apart from your GF is healthy and will also help you grow as an individual. It doesn’t mean you love her any less, in fact it is very healthy for people to do this.	boris246	reply	na	na	na	0.0032055687624961138	weak	no	no	na	relationships

My recommendation is that you nurture your friendships, nurture your hobbies, and come to terms with the fact that the relationship might only be temporary. It also might be the one for you forever, but there's no way of knowing at your age.

I think you're confusing love with codependency. Codependents can be in love but the way they focus or express that love can be unhealthy. You either love someone or you don't, but what you feel intensifying is your attachment or desperation to stay connected to her. Like others have mentioned, in order to relax your feelings of obsession or attachment, you need to add more balance and relationships to your life.

You don’t need to love her less, but you do need to recognize that you are an individual. That doesn’t diminish simply because you’re seeing someone. You have your own interests and hobbies and your own friends. Or at least you should. If you don’t, find some! It is okay to spend time for yourself or you will lose yourself in her and where would that leave you if things do ever end in a break up? Life has many seasons and things are constantly changing. Yourself included. You are two separate people with lives outside of each other. That’s how it is supposed to be. She should be an addition to your life, not your whole life. And the same for you. You should be an addition to her life, not the whole thing. It is perfectly normal for you to go bowling with your guys while she goes to a movie with her girls. It is okay to take separate vacations with your families. It is okay for her to do things for herself and it is okay for you to do the same. That’s what healthy relationships do. Once you become obsessed with each other, that isn’t love. It is normal to have some space while still being together. Conversations with your partner can get pretty bland real quick if they are the only person you spend any time with and then it’ll eventually fizzle out. My advice is this: Find who you are outside of the relationship.

"You know, if I could go back in time to your age and give myself advice, I would try to remind myself that not everybody is meant to be together and that's not necessarily A Bad Thing. You could do everything right in a relationship and it's not your fault if it fails. Truly, as a 29-year-old who has his shit mostly together, I'm telling you you have your shit a lot more together at your age than I did when I was that young.

There's a lot of great advice on this Reddit post and I would recommend that you take that in stride with mine.

But if you break up, just try not to beat yourself up about it and recognize that it's most likely not your fault as long as you've been honest with us about everything in this post.

Try to also be friends with people that you cherish even if you break up with them or they break up with you because it could turn out that they might have changed enough to lose romantic attraction for you or you for them but that doesn't mean they're a bad person or that you're a bad person. Don't let Society tell you what you should or shouldn't be.

If you break up with each other, take some time to heal, but if you can be friends then be friends. I wish I had let myself know that back then.

I'm weird though because I'm a guy who has exclusively all female friends and I'm now in a relationship with somebody who enjoys being around me and my friends which is rare in and of itself because a lot of women don't feel comfortable with that. But I'm extremely grateful and lucky to have my partner. And I'm also extremely grateful and lucky to have my friends who are always there to support me when I need it. I'm even friends with some of my exes, but only the healthy ones where we broke up amicably and mutually because of Life differences.

breakups don't need to be the end of the world and you can use them as a teaching moment or a moment of personal growth. In the meantime, focus on yourself, spend time engaging in hobbies, make time for your girlfriend but don't make her the center of your life, meet new people, make new friends, and focus on being a full person for yourself not for her. 

People often have this misconception that two halves come together to make a whole in relationships but that's not healthy because that means that each of you is not a whole person when you're apart.

Relationships are more of a "" the whole is greater than the sum of its parts"" kind of situation. If you focus on being a whole person and you both bring two whole people to the table, you will have a relationship that is greater than the sum of its parts.

I could put all of the parts that are required to make fully functioning engine in front of you but that doesn't make it an engine. You have to actually put it together for it to work. If you just put all the parts in front of you in a jumbled mess, they are nothing useful. But when you put them all together, you have a fully functioning engine - more than just the sum of it's parts. In the same way, you don't have a fully functioning relationship if you're only half a person by yourself."	boris246	reply	na	na	na	0.0032055687624961138	weak	no	no	na	relationships

"You started the relationship as barely teenagers, she was 13. She is 16 now and has grown and matured in this time. Women mature faster than males, so her maturation level is years ahead of yours.
She is also starting to realize that childhood infatuation she had with you is waning and no longer there with you.

In my opinion this relationship has run it's course and rather than going OTT like you are starting to, you need to back off and when she tells you straight up it's over then you need to accept it and not push it. You are both still growing into adults and a relationship started at such a young age where boyfriend and girlfriend is fun and exciting will not last forever as we grow and change. She will want to experience life, friends etc away from you and honestly you should want the same. Holding onto this is not healthy for you and will only cause yourself heartbreak."	boris246	reply	na	na	na	0.0032055687624961138	no	strong	no	na	relationships
It’s hard to tone down feelings. My best advice is to not let it consume you. You are your own person and don’t let yourself drown out in the background of all these strong feelings for her and for your relationship. Don’t lose touch with your true self. That’s what she fell in love with to begin with also. We all change and grow so much over time. It’s natural for relationships to grow closer and drift apart some over time. The more you focus on the drifting apart, the harder it is to grow closer again. I too didn’t always understand the difference of being in love with someone and just loving them. But I have learned that we can waver back and forth between the 2 ways of love for a significant other. It sounds like you are having intense anxiety/stress over the whole situation and I know it’s very hard to do, but trying to find a new focus or hobby, just a cpl hours a week even can help so much. You may not even notice the difference right away but I can assure you that if you try and stick it out, after awhile you’ll notice a difference. Just having something else to take your focus and energy for that short amount of time can make a world of difference :)	boris246	reply	na	na	na	0.0032055687624961138	weak	no	no	na	relationships

"It is important to not lose yourself in a relationship as it hampers your individual growth and puts too much pressure on your partner and the relationship.  I would encourage you to educate yourself about healthy relationship qualities and skills.  Being obsessed with someone is infatuation and eventually that either dies or evolves into a deeper love.   
 Relationship have seasons and it is not unusual for one person to feel more connected than another.  What matters is that you are able to discuss it and work to reconnect to one another."	boris246	reply	na	na	na	0.0032055687624961138	no	no	no	na	relationships
Hey man, I’ll be honest, I’ve been there… twice. So attached to the point where you feel like you’ll be lost with out them and can’t go on without them HOWEVER here I am, single for the past 9 months, and thriving. Don’t let the relationship define you as a person, try to find other sources of happiness, and a steady support system of a few solid friends. Attempt to branch out while you can. Find new hobbies (cooking, sports, music, stocks, etc), start lifting weights, eating healthy, and working hard at your craft. You’re so young that you will stand out like a sore thumb since everyone else is focused on partying and having a good time in HS.  I promise everything will fall into place and whatever is meant to happen, will. Do the right things and god will reward you in time.

"At your age, chances are you won't end up together anyway. So think about what if this isn't your final love. What if she isn't your forever person. You'll feel terrible. Lost, mad. But then you'll come to terms with the possibility and value the current time and want to grow with her as long as you're both together. That gives the relationship a better chance of being one of the exceptions. Live in the present and focus on building a good attitude, making good memories, and nurturing your head space. 

Right now you're too attached and you're suffocating her. That's not love, take it from a 31 year old. That's insecurities. And you'll figure out how to separate the two and keep only the love and some healthy attachment. 

You already kinda know that and you're trying to improve yourself so have faith in yourself, you'll do it. 

How to do it, a few ways.

1- Have your own friends circle that is a good influence on you, helps you grow. Let it be not all boys or all girls. Let there be balance. And this isn't your girlfriend's mutual friends. If you already have such a group, spend more time with them. 

2- Have activities, skills, hobbies that you do on your own without her. Something that you're interested in and not something that you think will impress her. Also, make sure at least one such hobby or thing is in a community of people with the same interest. Meet people there. 

3- Focus on your studies and health. I know it sounds like typical parent advice. But I'm only saying this so that you have a more well -rounded day instead of thinking about her too often. When you sit all day waiting for her and then finally it's time to talk, you would've missed her but it won't pay off cuz she'll sense that you were waiting for her all day and don't have a life of your own. 
When you actually end up going through the day busy, your attitude will be different in a way you can't tell but others can and she'll feel less suffocated and will also start missing you cuz you'll see if you're doing it right, you won't be available for her the moment she asks or even before. 

But don't try to fake it, cuz it's always very evident and it's even worse than not pretending to miss her all day. It's better to suffocate her directly than pretend like you weren't having a terrible time giving her space. Take space for yourself and let it be genuine."	boris246	reply	na	na	na	0.0032055687624961138	no	no	no	na	relationships
"I guess I'd ask you what specific things your GF listed as indications that you love her more than she loves you?  Why does she feel this way?  What signals are you giving her that might be a little much for her?

If it's available to you, maybe talk to a therapist or a school counselor about co-dependency and read up on healthy relationship dynamics.  It wouldn't hurt to do things with friends outside the relationship - I mean, hang out, day trips, hobbies, sports, etc."	boris246	reply	na	na	na	0.0032055687624961138	no	no	strong	na	relationships
"I think it’s important to remember that in the beginning of the relationship you both were 13/14 so I’m sure she’s gotten less jealous over every encounter as she has matured with age and has different things to worry about. So I think this is just a little example on how people grow and change - that doesn’t mean its a bad thing though. 

At your age and considering when you started dating one of you may actually grow out of the relationship. Or perhaps you both can grow together and make it work. 

For that I suggest you get your own lives outside of each other. Being each others only friend and outlet might actually pull you apart bc there are some little interests that you might not have in common and are forced to avoid them. This can lead to resentment or arguments. But instead with friends there are more things to explore. It’s not replacing your gf but rather building relationships on simple things that don’t need to have any romantic attachments. You can express another side of yourself. 

Also I think building your own life by making friends, having hobbies, going out, gym, etc would make her not feel as bad and less like you love her more than she does. There’s no need to reduce your love for her but showing her that the relationship has not consumed you may make her feel better about you being together."	boris246	reply	na	na	na	0.0032055687624961138	weak	no	no	na	relationships

I just want to point out how mature of a response this is. I have not been 17 in quite some time, but none of the 17 year old boys I ever knew would have come to this conclusion. It’s very common and natural to feel the need to cling tighter when you feel someone might slip away. Having the understanding that making someone your everything is not healthy for the relationship or for yourself as an individual will serve you so well as you get older. It leaves you room to grow into yourself, learn about yourself, figure out how you’d like adult you to be. Even if the friendships don’t last or the hobbies change, the act of putting that work into yourself will be such good practice for the future.

It’s not so much about controlling (or repressing) emotion as it is recognizing that you’re in control of your actions in response to emotion. And I do think that’s an important distinction to make, especially for young men. A lot of people think that controlling your emotions means pushing away all negative emotion and not ever expressing that. Negative emotions are deeply important to us as humans. Think of it like physical pain - as an indicator that something’s not right. It’s important to recognize and respond to that pain, or risk further injury. Only you are in control of how you respond to negative emotions. You have that power.	boris246	reply	na	na	na	0.0032055687624961138	no	no	no	na	relationships

"Thank you for your kind words. When I was younger I was in a situation where I had to unfortunately grow up really quickly and I think it's what made me be relatively self-aware and mature for my age.

I totally believe that I need to find friends and hobbies but it's incredibly hard for me to do. I've decided that I'm going to rejoin my old tennis club in terms of hobbies.

I came to sixth form from my secondary school with my best friend of 12 years and we've recently grown incredibly distant because I don't get along with his new girlfriend. I am more than able and willing to coexist with her for the sake of my best friend but she is not as willing as I.

I was always very content with having a best friend and a girlfriend. (I get along with everyone at school but not enough to call it friendship) now I'm in a situation where my best friend is worried to be seen with me for the sake of his relationship (I know that's not right but I have done so much to try to help him and he's just taking none of it) and I'm worried about my own relationship now too.

Things have over the past couple months taken a sudden turn for the worse for me. I'm incredibly down and sad very often. I know life shouldn't be sad but I can't help but feel any other way.

"Oh I'm getting ""Ur"" point alright. OP needs to learn about the real world, not fiction. He's already a bit naive and silly teen shows that are entertaining but unrealistic are not going to help him. 

People traditionally like stories where the main couple has some kind of ""stronger than death"" love. Often television viewers dislike having to adjust if the main couple don't work out and one of them starts dating someone else (that's where the ""OTP"" trope comes from). And teen wolf was aimed at teenagers so naturally the main couple are teenagers who fall in love at first sight and nothing can ever tear them apart blah blah blah. That's all very well when you're making a television show and you want it to be popular, but it's extremely unrealistic. One single scene where Scott's mother points out that Scott is basically still a child and will love other people in the future doesn't undo that.

"Right now, we have a four year old together and our parenting is noticeably different which is creating a lot of issues. Hes trying to be more assertive to our son and focus on rules and discipline. I have no problem with that, I do however have an issue with how he goes about it.

He gets super agitated (I do blame his ongoing TBI) and irritated with him which results in our son being upset. It makes me upset our son is upset then I step in to comfort him. I dont know where to step in anymore when he is trying to discipline him on something and now he is starting to throw things at me like: ""lm the oldest of 5, I have more experience than you do"" and unfortunately when he gets super upset with me he calls me stupid a lot. 

I hate to think im in an emotionally abusive relationship but hes coming across as too controlling with the way hes trying to teach our son and being disrespectful to me now. What should I do?

"I don't know that the entire relationship is abusive, but it is abusive behavior to repeatedly call someone stupid.

I think when you are called names you should stop everything and address it. Let him know he is not to call you stupid again, especially in front of your child. Be very stern. That's not ok. Demand an apology.

As far as how to parent your son, it's ok if you use slightly different approaches, however, consistency is key. Write down the house rules and the consequences if your son breaks those rules. Everyone needs to be on the same page. If you see your partner is losing patience, tag in and tell him you've got it because he's getting heated. Ask him to take a break to cool down.

Children are THE most stressful mofos on the entire planet. Your partner probably can't handle all the stressors in his life and maybe takes it out on his family. That's not ok, but it's a possible reason why he flips out and gets so frustrated. Children can be very annoying and triggering.

"I am going to try to keep this breif but we will see. I am really in need of advice, because I have suddenly hit a moment of ""oh shit, what am I going to do""? 

To start from the beginning, I (24F) got into a fwb situationship 3 years ago, which lasted about 1.5 years. This person (26M), we will name him John, was someone I had been good friends with and had suddenly become my #1 go to and best friend, and from there a sexual relationship also devleoped. And let me say - the sex was AMAZING and the physical attraction was very strong. Throughout our situationship we went from both living in the same area to being long distance. Distance put a strain on our mostly physical relationship, but we made it work. We both felt very strongly for each other, and thus was communicated early on, and by the end we both truly loved each other. It was clear that we were well matched emotionally and sexually. But distance and issues with communication drove us to decide to end our situationship (and things didnt end the greatest, given feelings were involved). After breaking up, I was devistated, as it was truly one of the most heart wrenching break ups i had been through.

A few months later I started to hang out with my current boyfriend (24M), who we will name Liam, and soon after we started dating. We have nk been dating for about 9 months. He is great, and has helepd me through so much. I struggled a lot the last year with depression and anxiety, and he has been a rock for me. He is kind, sweet, loving, emotional, and just about the funniest person I have ever met. I do really feel like i love him. Things were great between us until about 3 months ago when we both moved and now we are long distance. I moved to a town which unknowingly John had also just moved to (we werent communicating any more, so it was a shock to find this out). 

Since being in this new town I have seen John a lot when hanging out with mutual friends, and lets just say I couldnt deny the sudden feelings that came flooding back. Until now i have ignored those feelings and we have kept our interactions breif and friendly. Seperately, my relationship with Liam has been not the greatest. Recently distance has strained us a lot because we got so used to spending every day together. Additonally i cant help but feel deep down that my attraction to Liam is dwindling. I still love him deeply, but find it very hard to reciprocate sexual advances when i see him. I just struggle to feel a strong sense of physical attraction to him, even when i try to convince myself i am too in my head. I find myself doubting the future that i used to see with him. These feelings have been going on for about 1.5 months. 

Now, flash foward to this past weekend, i realized how strong of an attraction and feelings i still have for John. I cant deny that our physical and sexual attraction has never been of question, and my sudden realization that i may still have feelings for him have made me question things. John has made it clear he misses me and would be willing to have a fresh start and real, solid relationship if that is what i wanted. He has been working on himself on his own a lot and has been regularly seeing a therapist, which i really appreciate. But i am so conflicted about what to now do about my current relationship with Liam. I love him a lot, and i am not sure if its just the distance that is ruining how i feel about him, or if something truly isnt right. I have a hard time imagining breaking up with him, but I have been wanting to tell him the truth about losing a physical attraction towards him, but i dont know if thats the right thing to do. Should i tell him about my doubts in our relationship, especially my loss of attraction towards him? Or is something superficial like physical attraction an unfair thing to bring to the table when discussing the state of our relationship? I dont want him to be self conscious and think theres something wrong with him. 

And, what do I do about John? Is it worth entertaining the idea of breaking things off with Liam to pursue my resurfacing feelings towards John?

TL;DR should I end my current relationship due to a resurfacing of feelings for a past partner?"	First_Mistake3287	post	20.754181446840718	male	White	0.003825604682788253	na	na	na	6	relationships
You've only been with Liam for 9 months, and you're already losing physical attraction- now this person who you had massive feelings and attraction for is back, and the main thing that wasn't working before (distance) isn't a factor. To me it seems obvious that you'll regret it if you don't try things with John again- however, you have to know that there is a chance it won't work, and then you will have lost out on 2 relationships.

I just dont know if its worth even trying to discuss my issues with a loss of attraction with Liam. Hes such a great guy, and we have a real bond. But it seems more as friends and i feel like i owe him some sort of chance or explination. So im not sure how to go about it. Deep down i feel like my feelings for John run so deep and its hard to deny that those feelings wont be going away any time soon.

What on earth would you telling Liam you're losing attraction to him do? That's not something HE can fix, so you'd just be telling him a flaw he has and making him feel bad, and then probably end up breaking up with him anyway. You don't owe him an explanation for ending things, but if you really need to tell him something the obvious answer is that you still have feelings for your ex.

"I am a 28-year-old businessman, and recently my business has taken off like a rocket. I've put in endless hours of hard work and dedication to get to this point, and now that my efforts are finally paying off, the company is earning in mullions.

My business demands an extraordinary amount of my time and energy, especially now. I'm constantly juggling meetings, negotiations, traveling and overseeing various aspects of the company.

But here's the issue: I've been in a serious relationship with my girlfriend for almost two years. She's been incredibly supportive of my ambitions and has stood by me through the ups and downs of building my business. Lately, however, I've been so engrossed in my work that I'm struggling to find time for her. We used to have regular date nights and quality time together, but that's become a rarity now.

We've had numerous discussions about this, and she's expressed how hurt and neglected she feels. She's not asking for all my time, but she wants to feel like a priority in my life. 
So, recently we got into an fight and her friend texted me that she is too upset with me.
She wrote that I said her that she can't be my priority or something that I care about my company first. I don't even remember correctly because I was angry and I might have said something like that but she also needs to understand that this thing can change my life  and it's my life's main focus.

"
Some context is that my boyfriend was raised in a very strict house Christian home and was home school so the friends he made were through the church. And as an only child, he was very much cared for and dotted on by his parents. A little too much if you ask him, so he learned from a young age what it was like to say a white lie. He learned how to get away with a white lie to maintain some what of privacy and secrecy about this personal life because his parents helicoptered a bit too much to the point that he needed to have something to himself b

Pass forward to nowadays, I have caught him in 3 major big lies, worked through it. But now I can tell when he’s l lying to me, and I honestly don’t know how I feel about it. I’m so happy in other aspects of my relationship but the lying really hurts me and is triggering for me. 

Is it something that I can grow to learn and tolerate while trying to help him heal? He says he’s sorry every time I confront him, he has not ever come up and said “sorry, I lied to you about xx, when you asked about it”, like come forth to own up it to it, I always have to confront him to tell me the truth straight up. 

I recognize that the best path forward towards a healthy relationship would be couples therapy but is there anything you would recommend I do/think/say, etc meanwhile I try to get up the nerve to ask him to go with me. Especially because he is sensitive too so it’s almost like I wanna go but I don’t want him to think or feel less than when I bring it up.  Or have those thoughts that our relationship is ruined so it’s not worth going to therapy either way. We both have a touch of depression too and we’ve been going thru a hard time recently. Not necessarily about the lying but because he’s having a hard time at work and has a lot of pressure on his shoulders from it.

I don’t know, I feel like I can just let it go because at the end of the day, I am happy in my relationship so idk if it’s worth breaking up?

Tldr my (f30 boyfriend (m30) is somewhat of a chronic white lie teller, I have caught him a couple of times and confronted him about it. He always apologizes and because of I know he had strict parents and traumatic upbringing, I rationalize the act and forgive. But to what end?"

"30 is little late to be learning that lying isn't worth the trouble it causes. And even though you characterize these lies as mostly small, constant lying is death by a thousand paper cuts for a relationship. He undermines the entire relationship because at the end of the day, you can't trust or believe what he says. You say that you've ""figured out when he's lying."" But if he is as practiced a liar as you say he is, I suspect you only see the tells he lets you see. 

It's not your job to help him heal and change his lying ways. (You can't, anyway.) But there isn't anything you or anyone else can do. This is something only he can do.

Also, a white lie is ""Of course you don't look fat in those pants"" or ""I enjoyed those cookies you made."" They're not typically ""things you catch someone in."""	Euphoric_Wind_8874	reply	na	na	na	0.9949000477790833	no	no	no	na	relationships
"Major big lies are the opposite of white lies. The next step is not couples therapy. It’s him being held accountable for his actions. 

He needs to acknowledge his responsibility for his actions and make actual change. If he says he’s sorry but then does it again, he isn’t really sorry. Stop letting him off the hook with this bs tough childhood excuse. There are plenty of people in the world who had a strict upbringing but aren’t continuous liars. Every time he lies, he is making a conscious choice. It’s not some involuntary reflex that he can’t control. It is him making a deliberate choice to deceive you and not own up to it until he gets caught. What is **he** doing to change this aspect of himself? How is **he** trying to get better?

Also, you’re enabling him. Every time you give him a free pass because his mummy and daddy were mean to him, you’re telling him that its ok to keep lying to you, because there are no consequences. How many times are you going to let this happen before you decide it’s enough? 10? 20? 50? If you want a partner who doesn’t lie to you, then stop letting this guy keep lying to you."

"Sorry if this doesn't make sense I'm just not thinking entirely clearly rn

We were originally dating for 10 months and we had a great relationship however the only problem is she has trouble committing and has problems with faith. She both can't commit to relationships and thinks that they will eventually just end no matter what. So because of this we broke up around May. We still care about each other a lot and sometime after even starting hanging out again and became ""friends with benefits"". This lasted a couple months but she eventually got the mindset that for now she just wants to be able to do whatever she wants with whoever she wants which hurts me quite a bit and has no interest in figuring out her commitment and or faith issues, which is completely valid (she isn’t actively searching for people to be intimate with but should the opportunity arise she wants to be able to act on it). I suggested therapy for her because I truly think it would be incredibly beneficial for her but she also says that she has no faith in therapists either as they ""give her the vibe of a secondary high school teacher trying to be understanding and give some lame advice"". I myself overthink incredibly easily and I'm quite sensitive, and honestly I'm scared that she'll find someone better and give up on me because she always makes jokes that remind me of her mindset. For example we both went to this party (not together but we were both there as well as our friends) and she kept pressuring me into kissing her there and when I made it clear I wasn't comfortable with doing that in front of my friends she said ""fine I'll go kiss somebody else then"" as I joke but it hurt me a lot. Afterwards we began to argue quite often as I felt she didn't care about me anymore as she couldn't even give me a simple hug and comfort when I got emotional and invalidated my feelings by saying ""I don't want to give you kisses and cuddles"" which isn't what I wanted at all. Because of these constant arguments I said we should take a temporary break because our current relationship was quite toxic for me, to which she got angry and immature and said stuff like ""if you're going to going to take this break then stop talking to me already"" and ""I constantly use up all my effort to keep us happy"" but still agreed to it. Cut to last night where I checked up on her to see how she was doing and we got to talking about how I feel like I'm a burden to her as she posted on her insta story about finally breaking free from codependency and because of what she said when I suggested the break to which she assured me I wasn't and over reacted in the heat of the moment. She got to talking about her own problems involving commitment and faith to which I suggested she actually try to work on as she didn't want to see a therapist about it but she had no interest in it and is
""sick of this self help stuff"". I know the advice going to be given is really obvious but l'm too emotionally attached and in love with this woman and don't feel ready to just give up on her. For now we will continue with the break but any advice on this situation will be helpful. I guess I just came here hoping for some magical words for someone to fix her problems and help her be happy as well as myself.

"This is really simple, honestly, despite all the words. She does not want to be in a monogamous relationship with you. She does not want to be in therapy. 

It's not kind or loving to continue to try to ""fix"" someone who has plainly and repeatedly told you they do not want to do the thing you're trying to get them to do. 

I know it's hard, but you have to stop focusing on her problems and work with your own therapist on why you are not able to let go of this former relationship with someone you keep trying to change."	Poopydoop0	reply	na	na	na	0.9971599578857422	weak	no	no	na	relationships

"Obligatory ""I don't speak English at a native level so please forgive me for any mistakes that I make"".   


I (31F) got thrown into the system when I was 4 when my father attempted to murder my mother. He got sent to jail, she gave me up because she didn't have the mental fortitude to look after a toddler. My parents (whom I shall refer to as such in the post from this point on) adopted me when I was 6.  


Now, I will say that they weren't bad to me in any way. Somewhat distant, but for the most part left me to my own devices and paid for things for me when it was needed. I didn't run around in rags or starve or anything. I (speculation) think that they adopted me because their relationship was going down the drain long before I showed up in the picture, and they thought that having a child together would somehow strengthen their bond. It didn't work out: to this day there isn't a single week where they don't threaten to kill each other, insult each other severely, or just try to tear each other down (they almost never get to a physical point, but their arguments are loud enough that the local police literally knows them by name and are used to getting called by neighbors at least once a month for ""attempted murder""). The environment wasn't the healthiest and I left as soon as I hit 18. I visit them for holidays, and almost every time they turn each holiday into a verbal bloodbath. Sometimes they turn that hatred towards me, but that's a rare occasion.   


On to the main point of this post: during the C-virus, my father decided to show the world how ""macho"" he was by refusing to use masks and other safety equipment at work and outside of it, and subsequently got the Rona. He got over half of his workplace sick with it, and was straight up open about doing it to his supervisor. Long story short, my mother managed to convince the company that my father was at the starting stages of dementia (which is absolute BS, man's just convinced that no one can tell him what to do), so they let him quit work without any severe punishment.   


Unfortunately, this led to financial difficulties for them because my mother does not work and those two do NOT understand the meaning of the words ""saving for rainy days"". They begged me to come back to live with them to help them financially. The ""unemployment benefits"" that they receive barely cover their utilities. Now, I originally intended to just send them some monetary assistance without me moving in, but sadly I just do not make enough to maintain 3 people and the rent for 2 places, plus food and my own utilities. So I made the colossal error to move back in with them. My landlord promised to hold my apartment for 6 months (I've been living in this apartment for 12 years now, I have good relations with the guy).   


It's been 2 months and I literally can't take it anymore. It seems that the time that I've been gone, they've gotten even more toxic and hateful to one another, and nowadays they often turn their frustrations to me and rage at me often, they scream at me, my mother even threw a glass in my direction. I told her last night that I want to move out again because this environment is straight up shattering me. I feel small, worthless and meaningless when around them. She cried and told me that they would starve and become homeless if I left them now, and wasn't family supposed to care for each other in times of need? I feel sick, I feel guilty, I feel dirty and I just can't get over the fact that I won't survive another 4 months of this hell. It doesn't help that it doesn't look like either of them is looking very hard for a new job, so it IS very likely that they will starve if I don't help them. They did adopt me and they DID help me grow up into a semi-functional adult, so I do feel like I owe it to them to try harder to stay with them. What do I do? Do I do what is needed for my mental health or what is needed for the ""greater good""? If I were to leave them, how do I do it so it doesn't lead to a mental breakdown or straight up fight?

"A girl broke things off with me about 2 months ago and it's been so hard to live down, at first it was bits of miscommunication but she simply didn't wanna continue which again I in that moment was fine. But the more information I learned it made me question the legitimacy of what she said, people would tell me that it's because I didn't wanna claim her or make things official.I've taken to riding my bike, it gets my mind off things but on the way to the park is this girls house, she never told me where she lived but I always saw her car pull into the street she lived in.

 Usually, I'd pass the street but every now and then i'd get off my bike a few feet from the corner, to a point where I could just look down the street a little and I just think about everything that could've went wrong and I don't know why I do this.On this faithful day, I go for a morning bike ride and for whatever I choose to do the same thing I've done multiple times but I spend an abnormal amount of time there just pondering, I even do a passes by the unsignaled intersection. 

As I'm ready to move on with my day riding down the street I see a familiar car which is her mother's, I don't know if she knew me or if her daughter was in the car but I didn't wanna find out so I turn the other way and just bolt it.As I get home I open instagram and on the ""notes"" page where you can just say whatever you want, her note says ""Stalker"".

It's too much of a coincidence yet I don't know why she would still follow me/have me unblocked, my uncle lives in the area so I wrote something about how he's taking me out of town to maybe throw her off, I'm scared she saw me but I'm never going back and I think I seriously need help because this realistically is not normal behavior.

TL;DR: I borderline stalked a girl who I dated for a bit and used the general area as a thinking spot, i thought that the only way to get over it was to just feel some intense emotion but I think she found me out and I feel so damn disgusting."

though the emotions you're feeling are correct and good to be feeling, because it means you are not actually a creep, and you have lots of room to grow as a person.

it's hopefully clear to you now that you need to let go and dive into other aspects of your life to get your mind off of the past, and more focused on your future.

now that you realize your actions were slimy, you should reflect on those emotions. try to think about what sort of person you DO want to be, and take steps to growing in that direction."	Fair_Comedian3848	reply	na	na	na	0.9986957907676697	weak	no	no	na	relationships
"Ok so my bf and I have been dating for 11 months. We have an amazing relationship, he treats me extremely well and we don’t really argue and if we do we talk right away and communicate pretty openly. We’re both 23, and this is both our second serious relationship. I want to know if I am making too big of a deal of the fact that I haven’t  been posted on his Instagram or Snapchat story yet. I have asked (2 or 3 times) and he has said both times “he just doesn’t post”. (He hasn’t posted a photo in a year and a half to be fair). But even on my birthday, girlfriends day (I know that one is dumb lol) or Valentine’s Day he didn’t post me on his story. I haven’t brought it up in awhile because I don’t wanna be annoying but it kind of hurts my feelings and I feel like he doesn’t want to be seen with me on socials/ to his followers.

**reference, I have him in 3 permanent story highlights and a pic of us in a photo dump on my page. I have also posted him on my private story a million times although he has NEVER asked me to post him**. 

Am I overreacting/ over thinking because he hasn’t posted me?? Or making too big of a deal out of it?? 
Please need advice!!

He's definitely posted more about our newborn though. 

He tells me everyday he loves me and he shows me by taking care of me. 

Now that's not to say I don't wish he would post about me but it's just not his thing. 

He brings me just because flowers and cards for special occasions. And random little post it notes to have a good day. 

Those things mean something. I'll chose those any day. 

Those are the kinds of actions I look for, not words for others to like. 

I've seen way too many people who post lovey-dovey posts online and know what they are like with each other behind the scenes. (Not loving at all. Lol)

"Your feelings are valid. I feel like this wish stems from the love language “words of affirmation” and is totally normal to desire things like this.

I suffer it too. I’ve been dating my partner for 3 years. Has he ever posted me? Nope.

I took him off my grid and he’s nowhere to be seen in my socials. He didn’t even notice it. He isn’t active on instagram, he doesn’t own a Facebook account. He has whatsapp to communicate with me and his buddies but that’s it. He really isn’t interested in social media. But dang it I just want to be posted sometimes!!!

I realize I never will, so I just push away that desire and focus on the things that he does do. He’s an amazing person and helps me out A LOT with my kids and childcare. What more could I want right?

Don’t let anyone tell you you’re overreacting though. And do talk it over with your boyfriend. Just tell him, calmly, that it bothers you. But that ultimately you can’t force him to do things like that. Which is sad you know, but it goes both ways. There are things he might want that you just can’t do.

I've never tagged him in a picture and he's never tagged me in one, we don't have a relationship status on our profiles, and our profile pics are both a few years old/pre-relationship. . .   


Basically, it's all about context and where he places you in relation to the things he values. Have you been introduced to the people he values, like his close family and friends? He probably values his reputation, so does he seem proud to be seen publicly with you and introduce you as his girlfriend/other half/baby mama/whatever? If you're included in the things he values, then he clearly values you too. If he doesn't value social media and you can see this to be the case, then it ought to mean nothing to you that he's not posted about you on it.

There's your answer. You're overthinking this. When I started dating my husband, I was anxious that he hadn't updated his Facebook relationship status to reflect our relationship. (Yes, that's how old I am.) But he hadn't used his account in over a year. (Pretty sure he hasn't touched it to this day, actually.) The point is, some people just aren't into social media.

Expecting him to begin posting his life of you two together is kinda like him expecting you to never post your life as long as you’re together. Yes “if he wanted to he would” and all that but truly if the roles were reversed would you stop posting on Instagram completely just because he asked (please say no)? 

If he was posting his life in granular detail and not including you that would be super weird and low key disrespectful.

"Okay so he’s clearly not hiding you from the important people his life. Also, if he hasn’t posted in 18 months, does he even have followers who would notice if he shared a picture with you in it?

I think there’s two sides to this. It’s totally valid for two people to place different subjective priority on different things. I don’t share a ton about my personal life on social media so I have an easy time empathizing with your boyfriend, but that doesn’t mean your priorities are less valid. I would encourage you to recognize that he’s probably not hiding you from anyone if he’s not sharing much else with his followers. It’s not a snub from his perspective. 

On the other hand, he should try to empathize with your perspective and priorities. If you tell him about why you would feel validated by him sharing something about you on social media, it would be very easy for him to just share a selfie of you two eating pizza or whatever. Sometimes my wife asks me to do small stuff for her that I don’t totally understand the value of, but I respect that it matters to her and that it’s very easy for me to recognize that it would make her happy with very little downside for me so I just do it.

"Hello again everyone, I decided to break up with my girlfriend recently. It has been a very difficult three years that weve been together, and I'll have to keep it organized because there has been too much that has happened between us to cover. 

BACKSTORY:
Weve been together for almost three years, meeting online and talking for many nights when we first met. We struck so many scary similarities and experiences, and we enjoyed each others company very much. It was a slim chance of meeting her (as we were both busy that day), and I was happy to meet someone who loved me like she did, and I felt the same for her too. It was like two stars colliding. We confessed to each other one night, but somehow I still felt hesitant to commit because of long distance and feeling that I was not ready personally. Two months later, I brought myself up and we got together. The relationship started off great as we were both talking a lot, being flirty, and expressing our love to each other and showing it off to everyone. We made each other handmade gifts, wrote letters, went on dates, played games, watched movies, etc.

MISTAKES:
While there were so many great moments we shared, ever since the beginning it was really unhealthy, maybe more unhealthy than I can understand for myself. I would make mistakes that would trigger her to cry (due to her past friends who were dirtbags), which I would apologize deeply and comfort her for. Once I learned to avoid mistakes that trigger her past, I began making mistakes on my own behalf. They were things as small as messing up in a videogame, or isolating myself when she hurt my feelings unknowingly. Regardless of what I did, it was always the same aggressive argument. For the most part at this time, it was because I was isolating myself from confrontation with her. 

ARGUMENTS:
Isolation was my defense mechanism ever since, which she only made worse. She would approach me very calmly and asked what was wrong, making me feel comfortable when talking to her. Her comfort turned into violent lash outs. She would get upset over my faults, and always turned the situation back on me, disregarding any of her own shortcomings in the situation. I would beg, cry, and apologize for hours (from night to sunrise) as she kept lashing out at me. She never gave me comfort for crying, and instead ridiculed me for being so emotional. I thought I was selfish for reacting the way I did for something that I thought was completely my fault. Regardless, I did everything I could to make amends. Id reflect deeply, acknowledge my mistakes, list amends to make, and apologize sincerely. But soon as another mistake happened, it would upset her even more.

LOSING SELF:
We would be back and forth in having great times; we'd laugh, love each other, and spend time talking every day. At one point it snowballed, where all of the arguments would run me down mentally to the point where I couldnt give it my all as a boyfriend anymore. I had no energy, no emotional capacity or availability. I had grown so far from my only two friends (we were a whole friend group before getting together), and I lost my sense of self. I lost much of my charm and creativity in my personality that I was so proud of being able to make for myself. I lost the ability to see through other people's problems and help and comfort them because I was too surrounded in my own. We argued for at least once a week for a few months. When Junior year started, I had no friends. I would often show up late to class, and eventually gave up on my academics. My sleep and diet were horrible because she couldnt sleep soundly without me watching over her on videocall. I blamed myself for all of this because I saw her as a saint. I tried to keep pushing for a better relationship and she did too.

LOWEST POINT:
I had to move last summer, and was at my lowest mentally. We had a conversation and brought up sex work and how she wanted to get into it when she was older. I expressed my concern for this as respectfully as I could, and communicated how that would make me feel cheated on and sad. I respected sex work, but it didnt match my relationship values. She yelled at me and called me a misogynist, and told me that I was one of those men who wanted to control women. I could do nothing but cry and apologize. She kept forcing me to say that I was okay with it. I complied to make it stop, but I was left with a horrible feeling in my chest for the next few months. I felt cheated on, and had the worst depression ive experienced in my life. The next few days I forced myself to accept this because I thought it was my fault. I read peoples experiences with their partner doing sex work, and how to respect it. It still hurt but I kept trying. I found myself mentally detaching from the relationship to cope, and this happened without me being aware. I felt icky whenever it came to my relationship. Along with school life, this caused me to not be anywhere near as good of a boyfriend as before. I kept trying, but deep down I knew this wasnt what I wanted. It was the reason for many arguments again as she saw me slipping away.

BREAKUP:
Things had gotten bad, and they were passive aggressive with me for a few days. They opened up with a text saying that I was her problem. She went on all of the reasons why I was, and said that she couldnt do this anymore. We said our goodbyes, and a few minutes later she comes back saying that she couldnt believe I said my goodbye to her. The breakup she had proposed, was a test for me to see if I would leave or not. This turned into another argument.

CURRENT SITUATION:
I have been working at my part time job after a year long of searching. Since I got it, I wasnt able to spend as many days as I could with her anymore. I work 3 days a week or less, and come home at 9m. As soon as I get home, I video call her and we talk or do something until 4am to make up lost time. I have stories to tell about my coworkers and customers, and try my best to make the most out of that time with her. She had lashed out at me after, saying that she didnt care for the things I say nor for my job (implying she was tired of hearing it). I tried comforting her and reassuring her, but she brushed me off. I took time to myself for almost a week because of that. She lashed out again for the same reason, and I took a two week break from the relationship. I took this time to realize what I would do without her, and if I would be better off. I looked back at the relationship and finally opened up to my friends about everything and they advised me to leave. When I called her, I heard how much my tome away has hurt her. She hadnt eaten and she had hurt herself. Seeing how much it affected her, I apologized for everything and I felt like I had to stay. We were together again, until she lashed out at me once more, and I decided that it was time to break it off. 

FINAL BREAKUP:
I told her that we were done, yet she keeps calling me every day. She keeps noting her self reflection every day to me. She tries to reach out to me to apologize for everything and all of her efforts I can tell are all sincere. I think she would succeed in treating me properly if we were together again, but I just dont feel like I can return my feelings to her anymore because of the past. I feel guilty for not giving her another chance, as I know her love for me is real. Weve been through so much together, and I am all that she has. I feel horrible for taking that away from her. 

Is there anything I can do to make it easier for the both of us? Im finding it hard to move on, and still feel like I have to be with her.

TL;DR  I broke up with my girlfriend due to hardships over the entire three years weve been together. She has a tendency to lash out, and I have the tendency to isolate. We argue very often and its very intense. Now she is understanding her faults and is willing to change. Her efforts and her affection are very much real, and it makes it very hard for me to move on."	triscuit000	post	23.286120288036198	male	White	0.9980729818344116	na	na	na	5	relationships

"My (19M) and my girlfriend (18F) have been dating for almost 11 months now. She was my first sexual partner, my first real kiss, and we’ve both been very involved with each other’s families. The problems started around 6 or 7 months ago, when I found out that she was having an affair with a classmate. They’d been flirting over text for about 2 months and I found out that they had gone out and kissed (I don’t know details for sure but her partner told me that they made out in her backseat for 30 minutes but it was nothing further). I reached out to the guy, he was pretty nice and had no idea that she had a boyfriend. We ended up breaking up for a few weeks, and I was so angry that I ended up going out with another girl and kissing her. After a few more weeks I told the new girl what happened and ended things, and me and my ex talked it over and got back together.

I’ve had issues since then. I find it hard to trust anyone, and I constantly am worrying about where she is, who she’s talking to, and why it happened in the first place. Was I not good enough? She hasn’t given me any reason to think that she would do it again, but I can’t stop thinking about it.

She often will have breakdowns without telling me the reason why. One example that comes to mind is when we were in a movie theater and she started breaking down, crying and shaking super violently. Eventually she calms down, but she insists either that there was no reason why she does this or that she thought I was going to break up with her. Note that I never ever threaten or show signs that I am going to end things.

I’m coming here for help, what should I do? I love her with all of my heart but I have so much trouble dealing with what she did to me. I love her family, and my family loves her. I have thought about ending things with her before, but I can’t stand the thought about what it would do to her.


**TL;DR:** Dated my girlfriend for almost a year, she had an affair a few months ago, but we got back together. Now I struggle with trust, constantly worrying about her actions and questioning my worth. She has unexplained breakdowns, seeking advice on how to rebuild my ego and move forward."

"Hi ! 

I'm really having a tough time thinking this through. The thing is, 4 days ago I found out my boyfriend has talked to a woman[33F] for the whole of our 7 year relationship. He says she is just a friend from highschool (which is true, they went to school together). I'm trying to wrap my head around it, because how come I have never met her or she hasn't been to any of our events and we haven't been to hers and yet they chat with each other every couple of months consistently.

I found this out because I was on his phone for something (we often use eachothers phones) and my gut told me to check his messages. I've never done that before in our 7 years being together.


I looked at the first message and it was 2 heart emojis from a girl asking to meet up..and asked who is that? He got defensive and called me irrational for asking it weirdly and said it's just a friend. I got angry and stormed off... I locked myself in the bathroom with his phone to read through the messages. He did come to the door and asked me to come out of there and to give his phone back and said there is nothing going on. I scrolled way back to 2016 since that is when we started dating. The messages were a bit flirty the first year WE were dating. The one that bothered me was a picture he sent her of jessica rabbit and it said very fiery. She is a redhead. 

From there on it seems just like friends talking, but he has reached out more to check on her. And asked who she is dating ( like why do you care?) She has occasionally said we should meet up with old friends, get the band together, It would be nice to see you and , no pressure, but I want to see you and sentences like that. She had never invited Us or Me, just him specifically. I feel it's more flirty on her end.
He has never told me about talking to her or about invites to events. To my knowledge he just hasn't gone, but who knows anymore huh.

I felt utterly devastated and upset at everything. I asked multiple questions about her. He said they kissed once drunkenly in his bedroom at a party( before us dating he said) and nothing else has ever happened. That he would never cheat on me and she is just a friend. And that I'm the only one for him.

The next days he has apologised for not telling me, he didn't think there was anything to tell, he ""sometimes just talks to friends"". He said I don't have anything to worry about. I said you're not remorseful for doing it? He won't apologize for doing it since it's not wrong to talk to friends, but has said he will stop talking to her if I so wish, but isn't willing to block her, because that would be awkward since they have the same school friends and people would notice.

I'm so confused..what to think or do. Like, I'm not a controlling person, you can be friends with whomever you wish, but isn't it really odd and deceitful that I didn't know about her? That I never knew my bf of 7 years is talking to a female friend throughout all of our relationship?


ESPECIALLY since in the second year of our relationship there was an issue with another highschool girl friend, whom he was waaay too touchy feely with and we had to set up rules and discussed boundaries with female and male friends so in the future I would never be made to feel like this again. He says he doesn't even remember what we agreed on, because it was such a long time ago. That irked me as well.

We have bought a home together, we are trying to have a baby. I could be pregnant right now for all I know.

I've cried so much since then and he asks how he could make me feel better and even thanked me for not leaving him. But I haven't decided what to do or think..I just keep repeating myself and going over everything and saying I'm confused. Doesn't help that I have a photographic memory so the messages are etched in my brain.

So what do you make of this? Am I overreacting or underreacting or any advice on how to figure this out? I always thought we were solid, but no engagement has been a discussion/argument in our relationship and now I'm catching myself thinking if he hasn't fully committed, because there are other options on the back-burner?

Edit: I have apologized several times for my behaviour if that matters to anyone.
I added a clarification sentence(the message I saw)
I added another clarification sentence ( That I feel she was a flirting)


TL;DR
My[29F] BF[33M] of 7years has been talking to a female friend[33F] from highschool throughout our whole relationship every couple of months without my knowledge."	Muggedoff_muggle	post	26.343676768494383	female	White	0.9982602000236511	na	na	na	30	relationships
From what you describe it just sounds like they have been talking as friends for most of your relationship. So your reaction seems overly dramatic.	Muggedoff_muggle	reply	na	na	na	0.9982602000236511	no	no	no	na	relationships
I think maybe it wasn't handled perfectly, but it does seem odd he has never mentioned her before.	Muggedoff_muggle	reply	na	na	na	0.9982602000236511	no	no	no	na	relationships
"So... here's the thing. You found out about a secret connection your guy had with a girl that you didn't know anything about. **It's completely understandable that you'd want to learn more about her, including why he never talked about her before**. Given that you've been in a relationship for 7 years and have several ways that you two are establishing long-term commitments to each other (home ownership and family planning, for instance), you're absolutely in a position to have an honest and respectful talk with him about this, in the same way you've presumably been able to do so for any interpersonal issues you've had before. Relationships require trust, and you two are surely able to work things out through the communication patterns that have gotten you this far.

**But... the way you're acting does not make you the kind of person your boyfriend would want to be honest with, regardless of whether or not he actually has anything to hide.** You immediately stormed off with his phone after reading his messages without his consent. You've cried for several days, and questioned your whole relationship, despite not even knowing how you even feel about the entire message chain. If I were him, I wouldn't be in a position where I'd feel comfortable talking openly and honestly about it, even if it really was an innocent friendship.

If you want to get to a position where he understands how you feel about him withholding a friendship from you, you first need to:

* Sit down and understand what exactly it is that you're feeling. What does it really mean to you that he had a friend you didn't know about? If you were worried that he was withholding a more intimate affair, do the text messages reassure you that this is not the case? Why or why not?

* Recognize that an emotional knee-jerk reaction is not conductive to your goals of better understanding what his relationship with her is like. The only person who can provide clarification is the man you've built a trusting relationship with you. Sure, you can exercise critical thinking about what he tells you, but you want to encourage him to be willing to talk to you in the first place.

* Continue asking him questions about his relationship and what it's meant to him. 

* Consider what it'd take for you to trust your boyfriend again. Are you willing to accept the possibility that he had no insidious reasons for not talking about his friendship? Is he willing to recognize how it's important for you to know what kinds of long-term friendships he has?"	Muggedoff_muggle	reply	na	na	na	0.9982602000236511	no	no	no	na	relationships
So, you read through seven years of his messages without his permission, and found nothing... and you want him to apologise... for something...	Muggedoff_muggle	reply	na	na	na	0.9982602000236511	no	no	no	na	relationships

"I don't really see the problem here - do you really expect that you would be aware of every person your partner has a casual once every few months text friendship with? That seems odd to me, but if it's how you two usually operate and this is somehow different, I suppose I can see why you'd be wondering why you weren't aware of this one person. 

I do think it's absolutely reasonable if you're upset that he's forgotten boundaries you both agreed to, and that you're concerned if you want to be engaged and he doesn't. Those feel like the more serious issues I'd be focused on if I were in your position."	Muggedoff_muggle	reply	na	na	na	0.9982602000236511	no	no	strong	na	relationships
Thank you for replying. I will discuss all of this with my partner in a calm manner after I've sorted this out for myself first. I will be asking more questions, like others have suggested and if I was being dramatic for no reason then I'll apologize for that too.

This is very helpful for how to go about things. I am saddened by the way I acted and I have apologized for it to him.

"I did not read all the messages. I scrolled through to the beginning of our relationship timeline wise. I feel that the messages the first year were flirty, but then I can see how it can look like a friendly convo, but the invitations were always flirty and like asking him to join alone. There were heart emojis and flirty emojis from her but not from him ever. But he was the one to message first mostly from what I scrolled through. I didn't read through 7 years of messages. I wasn't in the bathroom long.

I don't even want him to apologize for anything. I trying to understand if I'm reading into things, because the messages might be seen as flirty and might not, but the whole friendship being a secret is throwing me. I don't think it's possible to not know each others every friend. We live in a small country, in a small town and I've literally been to all of his other friends houses,parties,events,weddings even friends of friends' birthdays, barbeques etc. It is very odd to me that this is the first I'm hearing of her.

"Yeah I do actually expect to at least know of everyone, I don't have to be friends with them or talk to them, but if it's such a close friend that they talk to as much as with other close friends of his I see quite often, then I do think he should have told me about her or get us acquainted. This woman and not knowing of her is the oddity. And it seems secretive and the messages were flirtatious on her end I feel like. And it's really really odd to believe that they talk consistently but haven't seen each other for 8 years. I have a hard time believing that as well, because he isn't much of a messager nor do I think would he keep up a friendship via text only.

Mostly it's him not telling me about her or never meeting her  ..raises red flags and makes me wonder if something is going on. Yes, I'm upset about the boundaries( it really is a mixture of everything) because this was one of them. There was a very inappropriate ""friendship"" we discussed at length how we will go forward and what I'm not comfortable with and vice versa. This was one of the topics. Letting me know about his female friends and he himself suggested that if I wasn't comfortable with someone I could tell him and he would decide if we have to work on it or the friendship isn't that important. No other instances have happened.

It could be the pregnancy issue. About 23 years ago my wife cried out of nowhere because I canceled plans with my brother to spend the day with her. I was so confused as to why that was worth crying about. I was like hey I get that you appreciate it but I don’t really think it’s that big of a deal you know hahaha.

At the same time, I think he's in his right to have an expectation of ""I'm not required to disclose all of my social communications with my partner"".

">I feel we have differing opinions on ""found nothing"". 

Found nothing *incriminating.*

You're emotionally spiralling and asking random strangers online to validate your insecurities, when all you found was that he was talking to a friend you didn't know about. Which wouldn't be an issue in a healthy relationship built on trust and respect.

My husband and I have been together for almost two decades now. I don't know all of his friends. He doesn't know all of mine. I genuinely cannot fathom trying to start drama over something so incredibly benign.

>I'm also not an insecure person by nature. I do have anxiety though and I tend to overthink things. 

Secure people don't act the way you acted.

And if you can't actually identify what you're doing to manage your insecurities like an adult, we've got to assume that you're doing nothing. Which is wildly disappointing, because you're almost 30 and still pretending that It's somehow a red flag if you don't have complete and total oversight of your partner's interactions with friends.

You want advice? Tell your boyfriend that you're sorry for violating his privacy and doubting his loyalty, and tell him what you'll be doing to better yourself. This is the kind of nonsense you'd expect from a teenager in their first relationship, not an adult woman who thinks they're ready to have children.

**I'm tapping out now and won't be reading your replies going forward.** I genuinely hope that one day you have someone in your life who cares enough about you to properly articulate why this is unhealthy behaviour."	Muggedoff_muggle	reply	na	na	na	0.9982602000236511	no	no	no	na	relationships
"TDLR: I am 26f and just ended a relationship of 1 year. How long should I wait before downloading a dating app? 

I am 26F and I broke up with my bf of 1 year about 10 days ago.

For some context, before this relationship I was in a 6 year relationship which I ended when I was 24. 

I've never done the whole dating/dating app thing before and I'm wondering when I should download a dating app and start talking/going on dates.

I've not really been single since I was about 19 so this all feels new to me.

How long should I wait before downloading and using an app? Or do I just spend time with myself for a few months? 

The idea of dating excites me and I'm generally looking forward to it.

"My ex and I were together for 2 years. We split a little over 2 years ago in 2021, due to incompatibility and not being able to see eye to eye on a lot of things. After the breakup there was some intense back and forth comments made online between the two of us (which I did initiate and have acknowledged and apologized for) that resulted in him distancing himself from me completely. I tried to reach out to him numerous of times after the ordeal online during 2021, but he was never open to communication. 

    In March of 2023 he randomly contacted me through social media to let me know that he didn’t hate me and never did. Me being in a better head space and having gone through months of therapy, I offered to start fresh and start over but he let me know respectfully that he was not interested in a romantic relationship with anyone at the time. 

    Every since the interaction in March of 2023, I noticed that he was creeping on my social media pages which resulted in really bad anxiety for me and required me to get back into therapy. Just a couple days ago he followed me on a social and started to interact with a poll that I had posted, but he hasn’t directly contacted me. 

    Being 100% honest I do miss the guy and I’m open to reconnecting in some sort of way if he can own his part in the breakup, but all of the indirect stuff/social stalking has given me major anxiety and I’m not sure what it means or what he’s trying to do or say. How do I go about this situation to reduce anxiety and stress in my everyday life?

TL;DR My ex and I split after 2 years in 2021 after a bad breakup. I reached out multiple times later that year to reconcile but he was uninterested. I noticed since March of 2023 that he has been creeping on my socials with no direct communication. And then, 2 days ago he followed me on social and reacted to one of my polls but still no direct communication."

Unless he's creating alternate accounts to get around being blocked, I'm not sure if I understand why you feel like he's ""creeping"" here? Especially since this all started from what sounds like an amicable private chat with him. It's possible that he doesn't see his interactions with you as an issue.

Either change your social media post settings so that they're not shared with him, or block him. If his engagement with you over social media is bothering you, then removing his ability to engage with you over social media seems like the sensible thing to do."

Delete him and ask your therapist to help you get over him. He is likely not interested in reconnecting beyond passing time on social media. I think his response in March confirms that.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2–3 months. I told him I wanted to take things slow because I didn’t think I was ready for a relationship, but we both liked each other. He said he was more than willing to go slow for me. So our relationship started.

My boyfriend is the bad boy type, but has a soft spot for me. He’s always been so nice to me, bought me a bunch of stuff, and is always taking care of me. Overall, he does everything he can to make sure I’m safe and happy. 

One night I was sitting on his lap, and we were just talking about random stuff, and before you know it, I heard him say “I love you”. I was so shocked, I didn’t know what to do, so I just looked at him blankly. I knew he wanted me to say it back, but for some reason I couldn’t bring myself to say it back.
When he realized I wasn’t going to say it back, he took me off his lap, grabbed his motorcycle keys, and left. I told him sorry as he walked out, but he just said, “you don’t have to be sorry”.

What’s worse is that I always say I love you to other people, like my friends (guy or girl), family, and anyone who does something nice for me. I’m a really loving person, and I’m always very verbal and physical with my love for people. I always hug people, give them a kiss on the cheek, etc.

It’s not like I don’t love him, I always tell everyone how much I love him. I’m always talking about him. But, I couldn’t say it to his face, but this has also happened before.
I was like 9 or 10, and I had this online boyfriend (I know this sounds stupid), but he told me he loved me and I just said thank you, like what type of 9-year-old put’s romantic meaning to the words I love you. 

I think there might be something wrong with me. Not only that, but I also mad it way worse by sitting on another guy’s lap because there were no seats available, he was the only one I knew there, and he said I could sit on his lap. My boyfriend saw me and I could tell he was really angry, I tried talking to him, but he just left before I could try to say anything.

All I can say is that I feel like crap, there has to be something wrong with me, and I don’t know if I have a boyfriend anymore☹️.
 
tl;dr 
I didn’t say ”I love you”  to my boyfriend, when he said it to me. While we weren’t talking after that, he saw me sit in another guy’s lap. I feel like crap and need advice."	Select-Winter-232	post	19.438666472280023	female	White	0.9981986880302429	na	na	na	4	relationships

"My (f21) friend’s (m22) girlfriend (f21) is clearly messing him around and it’s not fair. It’s obvious she doesn’t love him.
Whenever I’ve seen them together they do a lot of PDA and it makes me sick. She really plays it up.
She’s just using him.

I’ve never liked her anyway because she’s been nasty to me from the moment I met her. When he introduced us to each other she asked me where I got my dress from and I said NEXT and she said she thought it looked cheap. She patronises me and talks down to me like I’m a kid.
I don’t know why she’s so mean, there’s no point but that’s just what she’s like.

At his 22nd I saw her flirting with another guy in the corner and I went over and told her she was being disrespectful and she called me things I won’t say here but let’s just say they weren’t nice.
He stepped in and told me I should leave and told me I’ve got to accept that he thinks she’s the right woman for him and he trusts her.
She denied it but she clearly liked this other guy and it makes me so angry.

Another red flag is that she’s tried to stop him seeing his friends as much. Someone I know told me she was also very rude to his family a few weeks ago. I wouldn’t be surprised if she was using all his money as well. She seems to spend a lot judging on her appearance and the things she’s got, but she doesn’t work so I assume the money for all of that is coming from him, which is wrong.
I wouldn’t dream of sitting around doing nothing while spending all his money on stuff I don’t need.
It’s really annoying because he could do so much better than her. She’s fake and she thinks she deserve everything and it’s all about her but it isn’t. Always taking dirty pics online and showing off. 
Always wants to be the centre of attention.
The only nice thing I can say about her is that she’s attractive. And that’s annoying because she’s horrible on the inside as people say.

He’s not like that and they’re not a good match. I know him better than she does and he’s a man who’s strong, caring and has morals. He isn’t shallow and he doesn’t care for drama which she will bring everywhere she goes.
I want him to see this but he seems to think I’m mad which is upsetting, because he should know I wouldn’t be acting like this without a reason.

He called me yesterday to tell me his gf wouldn’t like him reaching out, but said he understands why I reacted like I did, but told me he can make his own decisions and that he still trusts her. He said I’m forgiven but that it’s probably for the best if we cut off our friendship. He told me it wasn’t personal but it doesn’t make it any better.
It’s scummy that I lose him as a friend for doing the right thing by trying to make him aware of something that will hurt him.
I’ve always been there for him, she hasn’t.

Maybe he’ll have to find out the hard way, but how can I get through to him?

TLDR
My friend’s gf is horrible. She’s mean to me and she’s disrespectful to their relationship. She uses him. I caught her flirting with another man and he took her side. He’s told me I should get out of his love life and he’s blocked me.
He’s only going to get hurt in the end and he’s cut off one of his best friends. How do I get him to see she’s not right for him?"	Remote-Jeweler7620	post	24.06089287566312	male	White	0.999502420425415	na	na	na	4	relationships
"You can't. The most you can do is:

* Listen to his feelings and perspective.

* Express your feelings and opinions to whatever extent he's willing to listen.

* Let him know that you're available to provide whatever amount of support you're willing to provide.

* Manage your friendship with him, including calling things off if his relationship drama is too much for you.

* Manage your level of engagement with her, including avoiding events that she's invited to.

But that's really it. As his friend, he's more likely to consider your opinions and perspectives than, say, a stranger's or acquaintance's. But you can't make him - or anyone - do anything they don't want to do.

>He’s told me I should get out of his love life and he’s blocked me.

Nevermind, scratch all that: you needed to do all this BEFORE he blocked you. The only tool you have for relationships is communication, and if the way you've acted around him has caused him to deny you the ability to communicate with him, it's now up to HIM to decide when he wants to hear you out.

"In the course of my 12 year relationship with my boyfriend I have multiple sitbacks. Like everyone does I pressume. However, its always the same issue: I am the one who always takes initiative when it comes to physical and emotional bonding. Like holding hands, hand on his shoulder, kiss, opt for bed-time etc.   
I have talked to him multiple times, little hints here/there and sometimes straight forward.. but I had some real confo's about it when it got really bad... 3 times so far. The first and second time I was on the edge of ending the relationship.. the 3th time I had no filter, I walked straight up to him and outed my concerns ''You are not taking initiative, I am missing a hand to hold, a kiss or a hug'' etc. By no means is he a bad boyfriend, far from it tbh. He's kind, loving, trustworthy and understanding. Its just that he is this typical guy who always say '' I just dont see the mess, you have to tell me when to clean''.  Well, to be fair, Im scared that Im getting a bit tired of reminding him my personal needs. Is that arrogant? I can see him being annoyed when I confront him with it, he's annoyed and hurt and keeps saying ''Ill work on it''. I dont like hurting him.  
After talking about it, small talks and the big talk, it goes okay for a few weeks and then it just goes back like it was before. I am just really lost because it feels like I have two voices in my head.. one saying , in dutch, : ''Elk huisje heeft zijn kruisje'' , which actually means that every household has its own challanges. The other voice in my head says I deserve more, I deserve and WANT that initiative from my spouse. Then agian, when im hearing myself think or even seeing myself write this I question myself : Is this relationship working? I mean, if it did I wouldnt be questioning it would I ? However, 12 years... its not like we've just been together for a year... we've grown together, we have history and a home. Its not that easy to just pack your bags and go.   
Another example : we are TV people, we enjoy a good movie or slapstick.. however, we are ALWAYS 3 feet apart on the sofa. In the past I was the one who moved towards him to cuddle.. then agian he never takes that initiative. Last weekend I was watching a show, and this show kind of hit my feelings. Unintentionally I poked him (on the sofa) so he'd hold my hand, he did. And as soon as I let go, he goes back to his phone not looking  up or w/e. I did this mulitple times before realizing it was because the show hit me right in the guts... I told him and he was like '' Oh really? Okay ''. It seems and looks like he really does care, and I believe he does.. I just expect more.. a hug, a hand, a kiss or maybe he'd could have just pulled me towards him so I could lay in his arms.  
I'm just so lost in what to do... Adventually I will have this conversation with him agian. Because I do keep in mind that it takes two to tango and he deserves to know and deserves the time to progress this aswell. But I guess im just looking for the right words and ... well ... advice? Is this a dead end? Do I give him a (oh I hate to say this...) give him a ultimatum? Do I adjust my expectations? I really did not have a relationship before this, im 30 now.. so I couldnt really have. Nor do I have a healthy relationship near me (not my mom/dad, sisters or w/e)... there is no one I can really have this conversation with...   
I really hope you do find the time to read this and help me... thanks in advance!  
   
TL;DR : Do I end my relationship, give aultimatum or adjust my expectation when my boyfriend does not live up my emotional and physical needs?

"Your English is just fine, in fact, better than some born here in the States!

So, to me this is a case of picking your battles. There is a saying that goes ""Is this the hill you want to die on""? Meaning, of everything that can go wrong in a marriage, is this the one you really want to focus on?

My wife also would come to me and say I should do more of the planning and getting all the details together. But in the end, I know she would just want to change things and have a ton of questions for me. So, I find it easier to just let her do it.

For whatever the reason, your boyfriend seems uncomfortable taking on the roll as the initiator. May I suggest a compromise where you let him know that you will plan a date night with him if he plans the fun to follow! It is easy to get complacent, and fall into a boring routine. There was something that brought you two together, something you loved about him and he you.

If your feelings on this are not addressed or given the importance they deserve, you will create a divide of resentment (which sound like you already have). Perhaps asking him to attend marriage counseling to help resolve issues you're both having. You have voiced yours here, but there is always the other sides point of view and concerns. One thing marriage counseling does, is it gets you two to start talking and listening to each other. This would be a good place to let him know his lack of pursing makes you feel hurt and unloved. Other wise, you might not ever find a good time to ask tough hard hitting questions. Also, you need to be sure to fight fair, no saying things just to hurt the other.

The last thing I'd like to point out, is you saying he is your first real relationship, so you have nothing to measure it by.

You’re clinging on but it’s sunk cost fallacy at this point. Don’t waste more years just because you already feel you’ve put in so many. He has no incentive to change because you have put up with it and couples counselling might help him see your perspective on things like cleaning but it is unlikely to change his level of intimacy because that’s just a fundamental incompatibility.

However, if you read about others that have come before you with complaints regarding their spouse, a good majority have regretted leaving thinking the grass was greener and life would be sweeter. Even those that were cheating on their spouse and left for their affair partners have regrets. I personally know of two. Maybe you will find that some time apart will clarify what you want. Someone move out for six months and go no contact for the first two of them, then see each other one day a week until you know what you want. No dating or seeing other people during this time.

You do deserve to be happy, and know that nothing ever stays the same. Of the 40yrs, (married 37) we have been together, we are not the same as when we met. We have grown so much. Marriage is not a bed of roses, it takes a lot of work, many times we came close to divorce.... but we didn't, we pushed through. Now that our two adult children are on their own and doing well, our marriage has never been better! There are times when we think back and physically cringe thinking about how we treated one another. But that is growth and made us appreciate who we are today.

You can see that I am advocating for you to hang in there and stay with it, because you sound like everything is pretty good except for this one area. Yes words are cheap and we are what we do, so if he doesn't want to lose you, he better open his eyes to what is going on. He better figure out why he doesn't initiate affection. Maybe he could put post-it notes up reminding him to go hug and kiss his wife, put a reminder in his phone calendar to make dinner plans today. He should by you sexy lingerie to spice things up.

"It almost been a month since me and my ex broke up from our 2 year relationship.

I (19F) like to think I've been handling well but..I keep having an urge to check her Twitter every now and then of my ex (24F)
Not as much as I was when the break up was still fresh still...

But recently she cut her hair rather short and I tell myself she's quite ugly now, looks like a man to make myself feel unattracted to her, it helps lose a bit of feelings.

Her hair was short when I met her but not this short and I assume she kept it long while we were dating because I said I like long hair, the same length as my own which is very long and now we're not together she cut it.
There are other things she does that I don't like now but the hair thing really takes it home.

I feel like a jerk for thinking this but it's just a way for me to help myself move on.

I joked about it with my friend's and made fun of her looks, of course them never knowing that was my long term girlfriend.

But even though it helps a bit, I feel cruel making fun of someone I love behind their back just to make myself feel better.

tl;dr I'm nit picking my ex apprentice to not be attracted to her anymore to move on and going as far to make fun of her with my friends."	CutieShut-In	post	21.600925332708844	female	White	0.9953586459159851	na	na	na	6	relationships

"Yeah.
We meet in a video game called FFXIV and later meet up IRL because it turned out we didn't live that far from each other.
I was 17 and she was 22.
Our relationship was a secret one though because of her work and my own, on top of our families not knowing about our sexuality.

She told me we don't have protection rights in our prefecture to not get fired if they didn't like that.
I don't know much about LGBT rights but she did and standing out and being different isn't a good thing in the work place.

What went wrong is a long one but I'll try to keep it short.

I betrayed her because I was ""frustrated"" if you know what I mean.
My friends would always talk about their sexual experiences with their boyfriends while my girlfriend was always telling me she wants to wait or do it when she's ready so the most we did was just kiss and groping but never anything heavily sexual like with genitals.

So I was jealous and upset that my friends got to do that stuff while I couldn't do anything or even know what it felt like.

I was also beginning to think she was ashamed to be with another women but that was just me trying to find justification honestly...

So I ended up cheating and she eventually found out, she ended up breaking up with me for it couple of weeks later because she said she couldn't trust me anymore.

"I am so frustrated. I hate living at my house sometimes. I live with a housemate, my parents, and 2 elderly special needs dogs.

One of my dogs is blind and deaf, and the other is a dachshund with back problems. Both of them need to pee a lot due to their age and the medications they're on. I have no backyard to just let them out in so they have to be taken out one by one to a patch of grass in my neighborhood (not allowed to take them in the backyard because it messes up the grass). 

The blind and deaf dog, I didn't ask for him. Our old dog died awhile ago and my parents announced like a month later to me that they were getting a new elderly special needs dog without asking me. Things in my house had finally been calming down with only 1 dog for me to take care of and then they sprung that on me. Then my dad got a new job that requires him to be out of state constantly, so there is a lot more pressure on my mom to take care of the house and the dogs alone. (Which makes me really guilty.)

So this is my everyday: At 6:30AM my parents are leaving for work so they wake me up to give me the dachshund to lay in bed with me - they don't like her roaming around the house by herself because she needs to use the bathroom all the time and pees on the floor. My other dog has to stay in the kitchen because he doesn't lay still in any other room in the house and pants loudly until you let him out.

So im trying to fall back to sleep, but then around 7:30AM I get woken up by the other dog incessantly barking in the kitchen to be let out (regardless of whether he has to pee or not). So I let him out and try to go back to sleep. I always end up waking up really late to make up for those hours I lost.Then I have to have the dachshund in my room all day, because if I don't keep an eye on her she will pee. Again the other dog won't stay in my room so he is always alone in the kitchen (it's sad.) I have to take them out every 1-2hours and make sure to keep an eye on them all day until my parents get home at 3:30-4:30.

My housemate tries to help as much as he can but he is not their child, so most of the responsibility is put onto me. He's nice but when he takes care of them there's always pee on the floor which gets my mom mad. He doesn't take care of them well enough.

All of this on top of needing to study and wanting to do my own stuff everyday. I am in a really hard program at college that requires a lot of studying from me. But with the dogs barking and needing to take care of them constantly I find it difficult to focus at all.

I feel very trapped in my own home. I don't have a car or a license so there's not many places for me to go - but there are a few nice little places in walking distance (pool, library, skate park.) I feel like I can't go to these places because the dogs trap me here.

I tried telling my mom this and she said ""will just come home on her lunch break and take the dogs out if I want to go somewhere."" I feel very guilty about this because my mom is constantly driving me places and has an increased workload both at home with my dad gone and at work. So I just stay home. She also gets really frustrated and defensive when I tell her how I feel about the whole thing. One time I told her that it shouldn't be my responsibility to take care of the dogs all day because I didn't ask for the blind/deaf one, and she got really angry. She does a lot of hard work at her job and takes care of most things in the house, so I do feel like my feelings are unfounded.

What do I do? Do I even have a right to feel upset? My mom says she isn't asking for much, and I feel like she might be right, but the whole situation still frustrates me.

TL;DR my parents give me my very needy elderly dogs to take care of everyday while they're at work (8-9 hours) and it is getting tiring."	dogy_throwaway	post	26.96968465177787	female	White	0.999446451663971	na	na	na	4	relationships

"Can I marry someone who I despise when he’s drunk?

When sober, my partner is kind, loving and generous. I look forward to spending my life with him when he’s this trustworthy, good person.

However, when my fiancé gets drunk (not that often…maybe once a month) I hate him. He’s argumentative, difficult, unreasonable, nonsensical. He makes so little sense when he’s drunk that I feel completely lost and alone. I feel the polar opposite to the way I feel when he’s sober. When he’s sober I feel safe and content. When he’s drunk I feel unsettled and abandoned. I don’t even recognise the wanker he becomes when he’s drunk. I truly despise that version of him.

I don’t know whether he would agree to stop drinking but I want to understand whether I’m wasting my time. Without him I’d be devastated. I often feel that he is my person and he’s a good man. But even though rare, these momentary glimpses into an unhinged/uncontrolled him is heartbreaking.

Can I stop him? Can I change him? I just want my sober and reasonable fiancé 24/7.

TLDR: I love my fiancé 99% of the time but wondering whether the 1% (when he’s a drunk wanker) should be a dealbreaker.

Edit: more info about us. He’s 30 and I’m 32. We’re on holiday so he’s drunk way more than usual. When at home, he definitely wouldn’t drink this much. So it’s not at all a common occurrence but even on the rare occasion it happens, it’s so horrible that it wipes my

He got worse after over 20 years, started doing heroin (really bizarre to start that late in life).  Still couldn't change him. He hit what looked like rock bottom so many times, he bounced down there, lived down there. Absolutely nothing. Three kids? Nothing. A grandkid? Still nothing.  Overdosing? Homelessness?

Eventually his mom got sick and he stepped up to take care of her. Stopped with the drugs, then the alcohol.  He is still clean and sober, goes to meetings every night. His life seems to revolve around that support system, which is fine, I am sure.  He had one relationship since getting clean that did not work out.  His life is okay, but I see a shell of that man who was amazing when sober and a jerk when he wasn't.  I couldn't change him, no one could, and when he changed himself, not only did he change the addictions, but the good and bad personalities he had prior to that.

I felt this way once too. It was only once a month, surely not enough that I should throw away the whole relationship, right? I flip flopped for years wondering how bad it would have to be, and how close together the incidences would have to be to be worth throwing away the relationship. I married him with him telling me that he would settle down once married, that he would moderate his drinking. What followed after that was 9 years of the incidences getting worse, and closer and closer together. It never got better, only worse until I finally left and divorced him.

"My first answer with just the title was no, of course not. When I read the description, my answer changed. I would definitely talk to him about it.

As long as he doesn't get violent or physical with you either through words or actions, I'd still consider marrying him. 

I dont think you should call the wedding off, maybe move it back a little and ask him to prove himself to you. Prove that this won't be a recurring or increasing problem. 

What I would do is talk to him about it, maybe try to find a liquor that doesn't make him a mean and nasty drunk. After this, watch his behavior and see what he does. Don't say anything to him about it for about 3 months after the talk. See if it progresses or lightens up.

Before deciding whether you can marry him, you should probably have a conversation with him about his drunken tendencies and see how he reacts. I have never been drunk myself (by choice, I'm several years past the age), so I can't speak to how feasible it is to expect a drunk person to alter their behavior, but I know a lot of people who annoy me when they are drunk but I love sober. My current partner isn't as unpleasant about it as yours seems to be, but she does have her moments of being unable to walk around or pick up after herself when she drinks, and I have to take care of her a bit on those nights. It's infrequent and I've spoken to her about my concern over it. She has made an effort to drink less on the occasions she chooses to go out and party with her girlfriends, and it has mitigated some of the damage. Perhaps a conversation with your partner could achieve similar results for you.	Thursday-Addams-1	reply	na	na	na	0.9987664222717285	no	no	no	na	relationships
">I don’t know whether he would agree to stop drinking

This is certainly a conversation I would have with your partner, wouldn't you think? Because no one else is going to have it, and you're going through some bad times because of his drinking.

>Can I stop him? Can I change him?  

Not if you've agreed to marry him without even having a discussion about his drinking. And he has to want to change - he currently doesn't even see it as a problem. It's happened a lot, you've never spoken with him about it?

Is there some kind of problem with you or your partner that prevents open communication in your relationship? Are you scared of him? Are you scared of speaking with him? Are you scared of being blown off? I'm just genuinely confused how this isn't a discussion you've had with him, someone you **agreed to marry**, if this happens once a month.

I think if you are taking a backseat in your relationship, you sure can marry a guy you despise when he's drunk. You've dated him presumably for a long enough time to identify this pattern, yet have never spoken a word with him about it. You've swallowed it whole and agreed to marry him, without even discussing it.

as someone who got sober a year ago i would honestly talk to him about it. “i love you so much and i’m so excited to marry you but my only reservation is your behavior during your monthly alcohol bender. i’m not sure if you’re aware of your behavior during these times but it makes me feel extremely unsafe and i don’t even recognize you. i love you so much and can’t envision my life without you but the version of you who’s drunk gives me real doubts about that. i don’t want to give you an ultimatum but to move forward with this next step i need you to promise me that you will stop drinking. i hope that you understand where i’m coming from and value our relationship more than you value alcohol. if you think that therapy or rehab will be valuable for you, i’m happy to support you in those as well”. something along those lines. he needs to decide for HIMSELF that he wants to quit drinking, but your encouragement might be the exact kick in the pants he needs and your support may be very important to him. however if he responds badly to this or seems like he’s not going to make any changes, it’s time to cut him loose. alcoholism is a hell of a disease but it gets worse and worse unless action is taken.

if he becomes really rude and argumentative when he’s drunk that’s who he naturally is lol. the unconscious and subconscious mind comes out when you’re drunk because your concious mind gets turned off since you lose… conciousness. the subconscious houses way more info, raw data and emotions and the concious mind would usually process that data and decide how you act based on social pressures, potential consequences, and culturallly embedded norms. so when the concious mind is not on, your behaviors are less influenced by society and potential consequences (that’s why they say that a person is most honest when drunk, you are more outgoing and don’t fear rejection aka consequences etc). if he’s nasty as fuck when he’s drunk it’s because that’s how he really is when he’s not thinking about gaining some form of reward (your acceptance, your love, society’s approval, etc.) or a consequence like you leaving him. you should BREAK UP with him, telling him to not get drunk any longer won’t solve anything because the longer you stay with him and the more comfortable he gets the more his natural nature and behavior will come out because when ppl get comfortable, their unconscious behaviors begin to leak out. he won’t fear the consequences of you leaving because he’s comfortable and know you’ll stay after while and he doesn’t care about the reward because he knows you already accept & love him since you’ve dealt with him consistently so his naturally argumentative rude self will leak out more and more even while sober. this is why girls usually say the guy started off amazing and so sweet but he turned into the worst most annoying guy ever… yea because he got comfortable and he was never really that great of a guy to begin with just for the fun of it he was only acting in a way that would get a reward (which MOST ppl especially men do) such as your acceptance and commitment before he let his true subconscious triggers, insecurities, selfishness, and argumentative behaviors come out! hope this helps!!! happens all the time😁	Thursday-Addams-1	reply	na	na	na	0.9987664222717285	no	no	no	na	relationships

How long have you known each other? Does he drink more when it's just the two of you and/or you have to be around each other for extended periods of time, or is it event-specific?

Have you had a frank conversation with him about it? If he has a problem with alcohol, then he really needs to know how it’s negatively impacting your relationship, and he needs to get help to stop drinking before you should consider marrying him.

If he doesn’t have a problem with alcohol, and it’s just that drinking lowers his inhibitions so he allows himself to be shitty to you while drunk… then I don’t think you can marry him.

Being under the influence doesn't change a person. A part of him is that person that you see when drunk. All the time. He just controls it better when sober. If a person changes drastically when drunk, it is something seeping through when guard is down. Know when else a person's guard is down? When they are tired. When they are stressed. When you go through significant life events, most people experience both of these. Getting married? Stress. This comes out. Buying a house? Stressed. This comes out. Going through an illness? Tired. This comes out. Have a kid? More tired and stressed than you have ever been for 6-12 weeks minimum. This will come the fuck out in droves.

"As others have pointed out, drunk him is still him. And those traits that you despise that come into when he's drunk may well come up in other circumstances, too - under stress, for example. When you marry someone, you're entering on a journey where you're going to see them in many different situations you've not experienced together yet, and some of these may bring out those bad traits on a longer term basis.

If he's as good a guy as you say when sober, I'd have a discussion with him about it. See if this is something he's willing to work on, not just in terms of reducing drinking, but also potentially in therapy. If he's unwilling to work on it, I would reconsider marriage."

"I’d argue that once a month is often when it makes you feel these ways. Imagine your car breaking down and leaving you stranded on the side of a dark and desolate road once a month. You’d probably be looking for another car. I’d also argue the likelihood that once a month will become more often over time.

You can’t stop him. You can’t change him. That’s all on him.

All you can do is communicate how you feel when he’s drunk and let his actions show you how important you are to him. Then you can decide if he cares enough about you to always work to make you feel safe in your own home.

If his drinking does that to you TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT when he is sober. If he doesn't believe there is a problem/suggest himself that he stops drinking then my advice is to leave. I put up with this kind of 💩 from my ex for years. He was always an obnoxious, rude, disagreeable and gross drunk but would gaslight me and say it was me. I decided to not even have a single drink anymore, not even one. That way I could prove the behaviour was all him. Well he just became more and more abusive and more of his narcissistic behaviour was on show constantly. The DV I experienced increased tenfold as a result of his continued and worsening drinking and he always had an excuse for why he was drinking. Trust me if he doesn't want to instigate stopping on his own and reflect on his own behaviour then cut him loose before you waste years of your life on someone who cares more about themselves than you	Thursday-Addams-1	reply	na	na	na	0.9987664222717285	no	strong	no	na	relationships
"While I don't think getting drunk ""*maybe once a month""* is indicative of alcoholism, his behaviour is clearly upsetting you. Despise is a strong word, so you need to address your feelings with him immediately before even more resentment builds.

 Maybe he truly doesn't know how bad he gets. I would NOT recommend filming him, however. Like most people, he'll take that as you trying to humiliate him.

Ultimately, I don't think you should get married to someone you actively despise. It's just not healthy for anyone.

What would be healthy is for him to see a therapist to find out WHY he gets really drunk from time to time. But that's something he needs to do for himself, independent of you.

"I strongly dislike my husband when he's drunk. He's not at all abusive or anything like that, that would be a dealbreaker, but he is extremely annoying, sometimes inappropriate, unreasonable, incoherent, embarrassing. He makes poor, sometimes dangerous decisions, the type of person you have to take their car keys from and force them into a taxi. Like you, I feel safe and loved when he's sober, and when he's drunk it's the opposite.

I have been married for 15 years, together 18. I think we have a very successful marriage because I have communicated how poorly he handles his alcohol and he has listened. He does not want to be someone who is all of the above, not in front of his friends, or in front of me.

He agreed to try not to get drunk very often. He manages his own alcohol intake and if I feel he's going over the line he listens and respects me when I tell him. There are three occasions in 15 years he has gotten extremely drunk and turned into someone I cannot bear and in those occasions he has slept in the spare room and I have made sure he's safe and not choking on his own vomit but otherwise kept my distance. 

I see all the top comments I scrolled through saying no, this can't work. All I can say is some people are mature enough to take this feedback on board and understand that they can't handle their alcohol and make the decision to not get drunk.

However, if your partner can't take this feedback on board and will continue drinking then I personally wouldn't be able to continue."	Thursday-Addams-1	reply	na	na	na	0.9987664222717285	no	strong	no	na	relationships
Have yo told him how he acts when he's drunk? Maybe video him and show him when he's sober? Once a month is often enough for me to put brakes on that relationship. If he actually loves you, he will listen to you and recognize his behavior for how destructive it is. If he refuses, then he doesn't love you like you love him. You will have your answer and can decide then. I was the one who drank in my relationship. Not often but I was a different person when drunk. I got black out once, cheated on my boyfriend. I realized then, that my boyfriend was more important to me than the liquor. Never drank again. He forgave me when he found out. I never forgot that. Be married 27 years this winter.

However, I do also believe that alcohol doesn't change your core personality, but rather uninhibits it and makes you lose control of it. So on some level, this is within him. I can't say with total confidence you should marry him if he turns into a total \[**CENSORED terminology which is gendered or ableist as it contributes to an atmosphere of incivility**\] while drunk, because I don't and none of my friends do, that's not what happens when you don't on some level have a \[**CENSORED terminology which is gendered or ableist as it contributes to an atmosphere of incivility**\] personality.

100% agree. alcohol just shuts down the concious mind but the unconscious and subconscious are at work which causes ppl to be more authentic and not controlled by their fear of consequences, rejection or reward. massive personality change shows that the man is not to be trusted and will let out more of his real (unpleasant) personality as he gets more comfortable and feels like the partner won’t leave. alcohol doesn’t change people it activates different triggers that are already in them. unless mixed with a medication or substance	Thursday-Addams-1	reply	na	na	na	0.9987664222717285	no	strong	no	na	relationships

"They are not caused by prolonged exposure. For me it took 350 ml of vodka over the course of 40 minutes. Got absolutely shitfaced, and then I was dated to drink more (I estimate about ~200 ml more?), and young and drunk and dumb me took them up on it!

Ended up blacking out just 15 minutes after that, and was told any the rest of my evening over the course of the next week. I woke up in the hospital (scary as fuck), and apart from a very fragmented memory of fighting some nurse I recalled NOTHING.

I hadn't misbehaved at all though. I was just a bit annoying, from what I was told, but fun overall. However, somebody pushed me and I fell into a bush and that knocked me out for real. Any test for conciousness at that point failed and an ambulance was called for.

That's just the worst occasion. Others happened too where it wasn't as extreme, and my memory was just fragmented. That's one of the few total blackouts I've had, but some would be partly blacked out.

"My ex and I had been friends for about 4 years, and we got closer until we decided to be in a relationship. It was long distance due to both of us starting college in different cities. There were a lot of problems with the relationship, like how he was encouraged to tell his dad I was a guy, so he wouldn't think we were dating. Over time, I started acting really clingy and crazy because I was paranoid about being ignored. 

Before the relationship happened, there was an instance where my ex had justifiably gotten mad at me and ignored me for a week. When this happened in the relationship, I thought I had done something terrible. During the days he'd ignore me, I would text him messages begging him to talk to me along with how I'm angry at him for not talking to me. After each time the ignoring happened, he'd ask to break up, and I would beg him not to. The first time was after I told him that I felt like I loved him more than he loved me, which he brushed off at first. At the time, I was probably just being insecure. I had to remind him about my birthday, and he didn't want anyone to know we were dating despite him telling me he loved me. This ignoring and asking to break up happened 3 times. However, after the final time, I acted the worst. I said some really awful things only to hurt him. I really did act crazy. He called me, and after he hung up on me without saying anything, I called him 15 times, which is just insane. He'd justify the ignoring as giving us space, but I would never give him space. At one point, he told me how me texting him like that stressed him out, and I did not respect that. I've apologized a lot. 

I know why I acted like this, the ignoring made me really anxious. I thought I had an anxiety disorder and almost went on meds because I was puking and couldn't sleep. It's been almost a year since the relationship happened, but I can't get rid of this shame I have. He left the mutual friend group we had because I told him I didn't want him talking to me. Every time I interact with them, I feel so guilty, like I have ruined something, or I don't deserve this. He's such a nice guy, and everyone else sees him as such a nice guy. I feel like I'm imagining some of the things he did and told me,  victimizing myself, or did something awful to him that I've forgotten about. How do I accept that I did mess up without beating myself up too much? And how do I accept the fact that I did act crazy? I can't get rid of this notion that I should've known to act better. 

TL;DR: I can't get over that I acted crazy in a relationship that happened a year ago. "	OkEntry724	post	16.73576711688463	female	White	0.9914450645446777	na	na	na	4	relationships
"We can't change our past, but we can learn from it and better ourselves for the future.

It's good that you recognized how you felt in the moments that lead to you acting in ways that you regret now. Looking back, do you have an idea of what lead you to feel the anxiety you had, when they didn't respond? Also, do you have an idea of what would have been a better way to cope with that anxiety?"

It might've been the uncertainty?? I didn't know if I had done something wrong or not, and I didn't trust him to tell me if there was something wrong. I probably also thought like this person who insists he loves me and wants the best for me won't speak to me for days, so I must've done something really awful. I think I blamed myself too much for the ignoring, and I would just constantly be trying to fix it. Since the relationship ended, that anxiety has stopped.

"It sounds like you made a number of assumptions about how he felt, and acted on them.

To be fair though, long-distance relationships are a pain in the ass, since communications tend to be really limited, both in time and medium, so it can be really stressful when you're concerned about an issue that you can't get clarification on. That's why I think it's important to recognize the factors that cause stress and anxiety - recognizing ""I'm feeling frustrated about not having a response from someone I can only call or text"" is good context to recognize, and can help you better understand the realistic circumstances surrounding your feelings.

"so me (20F) and my boyfriend (22M) have been dating for about 4 years, on
and off, in a long distance relationship. we broke up shortly after he started
college (he broke up with me), i'm assuming to be single in college and bc of
long distance since we were in opposite sides of the country. after a year, he
asked me to be his girlfriend again, and ofc i said yes because i never wanted
to break up in the first place. now, 2 years later, we're in the most healthy,
happy relationship ever. we absolutely love each other and constantly tell each
other this and consider each other best friends. we're still doing long distance
because now i am in college and he is working, but i visit every month or a few
times a month and it's great, no complaints from both sides.

recently i noticed we don't have sex as much as we used to. he was my first (i
wasn't his), and i have more of a sex drive than he does. we recently talked
about this and he says it doesn't have anything to do with me and that he is
still sexually attracted to me and loves me, but just isn't in the mood for having
as much sex as we used to. his job is extremely difficult and he works very
hard so i see stress being a factor in this, but is it normal to have sex maybe
twice a week in our early 20's? even when we were broken up, he never had
sex with anyone else or dated anyone else (we always hooked up when he came back for breaks) and soon realized how much he loved me. he has brought up the idea of having threesomes before, but would only ever do it with me, if i fully agreed. the thought of that really infuriates me because i'm very possessive and don't want to share him. he stopped mentioning the idea bc i didn't want to do it, but now i wonder if the reason he doesn't want to have as much sex with me is really bc of stress (and bc he smokes weed) or if he is getting bored of sex with me and wants to involve someone else?

obviously, he probably doesn't want to bring up the threesome idea again
after how i reacted, and because he loves me too much to make that topic a
problem in our relationship, but i kind of feel bad that he is only 22 years old,
has only had sex with one other girl in his life, and has been with me for the
last 4 years. should i agree to having a threesome even though i'm not fully set
on the idea? obviously, i don't expect him to be jolly at the idea of sex with
ONLY me for the rest of our lives (we intend to get married in the future), but
i'm scared that he will get even more bored of me if he already isn't in the
mood and we're so young. could stress really be the reason why he isn't in the
mood? (also want to mention i am pretty attractive and check every box he
looks for in a girl). 

when we do have sex, i usually ride and he cums very fast,
which i do not mind because he makes me cum just as fast. i guess i just
expect him to crave me more since we are typically not together every day but
maybe i have a higher sex drive than normal. also, i think because i love having
sex wit him, he knows it's always available and i want to try making him work
for it more, maybe by teasing him or something. what's something i can do to
make it known that he can't always get it when he wants, just to up the
excitement since i know most long term relationships fall into the trap of
getting bored bc you know it's always there. also, he already said he would be okay having MFM threesome if we tried FMF first, but i just love him so much i don’t even want another man. also, we are SUPER kinky and have tried many things so it’s not like he’s bored bc we are having vanilla sex.

any advice for what's going on and what i can do?

TLDR: i want to have sex more than my boyfriend of 4 ish years does. is it
because he's bored of me and wants to involve other women or is he stressed
about work? also, how do i make sex more exciting instead of constantly
letting it be available bc i always want it. we love each other but have less sex
than we used to."	ThrowRAprincesscry	post	19.918279698424918	female	White	0.001272075460292399	na	na	na	9	relationships

"dont try 3some. it'll just lead to bad things cos you're not built for it. are you ok with quickie when he's cumming and you're not? from the look of it he's stressed and tired and making you cum (even if it's fast) still can be seen as chore if he's not in the mood. 

maybe get naked, masturbate in front of him and when you done ask him to penetrate and cum quickly. as a guy, i'll still do that even if im tired and sleepy"	ThrowRAprincesscry	reply	na	na	na	0.001272075460292399	no	no	strong	na	relationships
"On one hand, you should NOT feel obligated to fulfill sex acts that you're uncomfortable with, including involving a third person. It's perfectly okay to say no to sex acts you're uncomfortable with.

At the same time, the fact that he asked you what you'd think about a threesome is NOT necessarily indicative of him having overall negative thoughts and feelings about your relationship or sex life. If you're anxious about how he feels about any aspect of the relationship, the answer is always *talk to him about it*.

>also, how do i make sex more exciting instead of constantly letting it be available bc i always want it.

Why not work with him on this? Express your concerns, and explore ways to make things exciting that BOTH of you are willing to experiment with and try? He already made one suggestion that didn't fly with you, but maybe you two could find something else that works for both of you?

Also, keep in mind that sex =/= penetration. If you feel like sex is over too quickly, consider having more intimate acts in the lead-up to penetration."	ThrowRAprincesscry	reply	na	na	na	0.001272075460292399	weak	no	no	na	relationships

i agree about the threesome part. i’m okay with the quickie, because other times when he initiates and when he’s in the mood it’s way different. he’ll do the work and go for a very long time. i agree that he probs feels like it’s a chore when he’s not in the mood, but that’s why i would rather not have sex if he’s not in the mood ya know. also, would the last part still work if he says that he doesn’t even jack off when i’m not there? he simply says hes not in the mood as much lately which includes jacking off. that’s why i think maybe it is from stress if he doesn’t even do it when he’s alone?

"i agree that him mentioning a threesome isn’t necessarily because he thinks negatively about our relationship, but it definitely makes me feel like he thinks about the fact that he could be with other women. i don’t think he would act on it, but i guess my concern is how successful can our relationship be if he wonders about having sex with other women, especially since he’s only done it with one other person besides me.

i’m trying not to be naive about this and i understand that he would be interested in exploring other people and i know he wants me to do it with me as that would add to the fantasy. it’s just hard because we think very differently about sex as i think of it as an emotional act and value it in a relationship, whereas for him, having a lot of sex with me doesn’t represent how much love he has for me. which is why to him, a threesome isn’t a big deal because it’s just sex, but i think of it as way more intimate.

i just feel like i don’t want this to be a problem in our relationship in the future because obviously he’ll want to explore new things, and it’s hard because i want to give him that but i don’t want to risk hurting our relationship. i know he feels the same way because he hasn’t brought up the idea again after i rejected it the first time. i even told him i don’t expect him to only have sex with me for the rest of our lives (maybe shouldn’t have said this), but it’s true, but i don’t know if i’ll ever be comfortable of the idea of a threesome.

maybe i’m too young and eventually will also be open to the idea of having a threesome with another man in the future? like he says that he would be down to do a MFM but i literally don’t want that lmao i only want him he satisfies me a lot"	ThrowRAprincesscry	follow-up	na	na	na	0.001272075460292399	no	no	no	na	relationships
"the last part is to fulfill your need. i mean it still can feel like a chore for him but it's a fantastic chore to do to be honest. 

happened to me when we tried for baby. i was out of the house from 7am and just back home at 8pm and i have to drive my wife in the morning at 3am cos she has to travel overseas. and that night was her fertile day. as tired as i was and not in the mood i still have to do it. it wasn't in the top 10 sex i have with her cos it's just plug in, thrusts and cum. but it's still pleasureable for me. 

i say discuss it with him beforehand that you want that kind of arrangement, you want him to just insert and cum nothing in return cos you need the intimacy, surely he'll understand. he might feel bad at first but sometimes when im inside my wife, no matter how tired i was. sometimes that extra energy suddenly exist. even it's just end up plug and cum, the hugging afterwards still feel sweet. and with you masturbate in front of him naked, pretty sure it'll get him going even if he's tired and stressed. 

talk to him about this and let him know you'll do this and what you expect him to do. don't just do it without him knowing cos it might hurt you if he doesn't react as expected.

A lot of things you're telling me are fantastic insights to share with your partner!

If it is, he'll appreciate your confirmed understanding of him, and if it's not, he can let you know more accurately how he feels. Maybe he can alleviate your concerns about trying new things? Is he actually content with how things are now? Is he open to keeping things spicy and fresh without going outside your exclusive relationship?

There's plenty of ways to spice up intimate engagements and keep things fresh while keeping things exclusive between you two!

The title is pretty self explanatory.

I [F25] met [M28] on a dating app a year ago. We lost touch but re matched last month. 

Avi (his name) told me that he was thinking of moving somewhere else for grad school but ended up staying in our city. He wanted to be roommates with his life long best friend [M25] but by the time his lease was up (May) his best friends’ new lease had already started (April).

We’ve had 3 dates so far and everything seems to be going well. We are petty alike and have very good chemistry but on our second date he told me that his friends apartment is a one bedroom so they sleep together on the same bed. 

After our second date, we came back to my apartment pretty late (he was dropping me off) and we watched some TV and made out and he wanted to stay over. I was busy the morning after so I declined. 

I had no problem with him having a roommate as I have two roommates myself (i’m also in grad school) and I know how expensive living alone in. I asked him if he was planning to get an apartment for himself but he says he is waiting until April to get a two bedroom apartment for him and his best friend.

I consider myself pretty understanding if others people’s situations and I would be okay with him having a roommate but him sharing a one bedroom is something I never experienced before. I wouldn’t be able to come over to visit and we’d rely entire on my apartment that is already shared with two other people. He’d have to be over all the time and I don’t think my roommates would agree with having a guy sleeping here on a regular basis. My ex had a roommate and we would alternate between his apartment and mine to make it easy on our roommates. Our roommies do the same thing with their partners. 

I feel like an bad person because i’ve been in situations when I couldn’t host (living with my parents after undergrad) but it was temporary and I wasn’t actively dating until a month before I would move to grad school and have my own place with roommates again.  He also wants to come back to my place to chill after every date we’ve had/suggests it. 

tl;dr: Seeing guy I met on dating app and everything seems to be going well but he just told me he shares a one bedroom and a bed with his roommate. Feeling uneasy about it

"How far do you two live from each other?

It's only been three dates so far, so I'm confused why he would have to be over all the time. Maybe it's just me, but in the first few months we are still doing outdoor dates and the occasional sleepover.

"Throwaway account and not necessarily a terrible situation, just curious to see if I’m being unreasonable. My boyfriend (26M) and I (22F) have been dating for about a year. Our relationship has been great so far and we’ve both grown separately as individuals, but also together as a couple through the course of the year. For both of us, this is the healthiest relationship we have ever been in; we try to be as understanding, loving, and communicative we can be towards one another.  

The problem is that through the course of our relationship, he gets a lot of dreams where I am cheating on him and proceeds to ask me things like “are you cheating on me right now” when I don’t respond for hours or “are you done cheating on me” as soon as he wakes up from one of those particular dreams of “my infidelity”. I don’t think it’s unreasonable for me to be offended, hurt, and insulted by the these types of comments, especially since I have never once cheated on past partners and have never given him reason to doubt my loyalty with him. I am incredibly in love with this man and often think of plans for the future with him, which is why these comments from him are digging deeper than they should be. I know that he’s not actually being serious, but I also know he’s not 100% joking

For context, he has been cheated on by past partners and he has also cheated on ex girlfriends. I told him long ago that I don’t judge him for it, that the term “once a cheater, always a cheater” isn’t something I stand by. He recognizes his wrongdoings in the past and is nope adamantly very against cheating/cheaters. 

His comments and little digs about me “cheating” have been more frequent lately and it’s been making me very annoyed. The last straw was this morning when I call him to say good morning, and one of the first things out of his mouth is “are you don’t cheating on me”. I asked what he meant by that and it was just another dream. Extremely annoyed, I said “don’t make me hang up on you” and the rest of the call was uncomfortable silence. 

I voiced out that I was insulted and offended by his comments and he said that he would stop, but that I was speaking without respect and talking down on him by saying what I said in the phone call. So now he’s upset with me for being disrespectful but I’m mad at him for joking and disrespecting me in a different way. We usually have great communication and are good at solving disagreements as a couple, but this just rubs me the wrong way. Am I in the wrong? Are we both?

"My boyfriend and I have been dating for over 7 months now, the entire relationship has been long distance and we only hanged out for a couple weeks before dating. We would try to visit once a month and even went on a trip together for a month in May. He currently lives 7 hours away but will be moving back to where I live in September, we haven’t seen each other since the very beginning of July. 

I am a very emotional person, and I told him this when we started dating. We for sure have had some ups and downs (on both ends) however, I’m typically the one to be more upset and stuck on things. I have had a really hard time feeling appreciated, prioritized, and given the support I want. He is currently studying for his CFA exam at the end of August. I truly want to support him however, I feel like I cannot discuss or communicate the things I want to because of this. I have gotten upset at nights very often and will talk to him, he’s made it clear he cannot focus on supporting me (in the form of talking about it or just listening) because it interrupts his sleep schedule, which he needs to be productive the next day. 

There has been multiple things which make me feel like the furthest thing from a priority in our relationship: ie, pushing videocall “date nights” to see his friends longer after spending the whole day with them, asking to come days later to visit than planned to play in golf tournaments, asking to arrive late on visit days to ski with his friends (when he was only seeing me for 12 hours as is), asking to invite 5 friends on a trip that was originally meant to be just us. I am taking summer classes and work 2/3 days a week and cannot leave my town essentially, I asked him to visit but he didn’t want to spend his free days (none study days) driving to see me. 

I try to be as supportive as I can but I’ve communicated so many times how I feel and past things have made me feel. However, there’s a dynamic now where I feel bad having emotional conversations with him because he’s told me so many times before either 1. He’s never had a relationship that requires this 2. It disrupts his study time 3. Disrupts his sleep 3. Disrupts his outside/friend time. I truly want a relationship where we both are there for one another when they need but, I don’t have that. I’ve told him this so He does ask if I want to talk but I’m so scared now that he’ll get upset at me for putting anything on him, but then I truly want to do talk with him, so it creates this back and forth dynamic where he’ll ask I say no then get upset that I’m not talking with him. 


Things were better because I didn’t bring anything up but today I was really upset because of family stuff. I tried to talk but the back and forth started because I was worried and felt too guilty about interfering with his study time. I ended up getting upset and told him there isnt a single time I could bring something up because he’s either studying, playing golf, with friends, or will complain about me ruining his sleep schedule. I told him this and how I’m hurt he can make 5 hours a day to golf but if I want to call for an hour because I’m upset I know I’ll get backlash, he said golf is his relaxing time so he needs it. I’m not sure what to do, I understand I make it difficult to talk about things but it’s only because I’m scared he’ll get mad that I’m interrupting these things because he has before.

Any advice? Am I being irrational?

"My partner and I have been together for 2 years (unmarried) and I just bought a house a month ago solo. I am in a high cost of living area, and buying was actually cheaper than renting because I saved enough for a large down payment.

My partner is not on the mortgage and the plan was for her to pay me ""rent"" (About 1/3rd of the entire mortgage, I pay the other 2/3rds.) We have had issues in the past, she suffered from childhood abuse and PTSD and it causes her to be very reactive and have anger and yelling issues. I should have walked away after the first outburst. I have tried to set the boundary over and over that I won't tolerate yelling, and things were better for a while but unfortunately the other day she yelled at me again and said ""I think I want to break up with you."" She was having a full blown meltdown over me asking her to clean up after her dog, again, because I am the only one cleaning up after him.

I think after dozens of times going through this, walking on eggshells around her, getting screamed at, making up, and then repeating the cycle, I am done. I am angry about not leaving sooner and feel confused as to why I let this keep happening.I am now worried about paying for this house solo. I can technically afford it, although without a roommate it will be over 50% of my monthly income and I am self employed (slower months it may be 80-100% of my income).

A roommate wouldn't work for the next few months because I have a lot of family coming to stay with me/using my guest room until October, and I have some other issues with having a roommate. Basically my last roommate almost burned our house down and it caused me such severe anxiety that I started fainting every day and almost admitted myself to inpatient psychiatric care. It has taken almost 2 years of intense therapy working on it and I still suffer from house safety OCD. I was diagnosed with OCD as a young adult and my brain really latched onto this. I know this may sound ridiculous and like I am making excuses, but it really is a huge fear of mine and something my OCD makes me ruminate about literally 24/7.

It will be financially difficult to leave my partner. I will also have to buy all new kitchenware, bed, furniture, etc. since it's mostly hers. I have savings, but I still feel vulnerable financially living in a very expensive city alone. I might need to try a new type of therapy or medication so that I can live with a roommate. Again, I know it sounds stupid, but I'd almost rather live with my abusive partner than a stranger who I don't trust. She is also a fire fighter (weird coincidence) and I do feel safe having her in the house (not emotionally, but I do trust her not to hurt my house.)

I know I should have had a better backup plan before I bought this house, and trust me I don't need this pointed out. I hope to eventually someday meet another partner and move in together when the time is right, so that I don't feel this financial burden forever. I could also try to find a 2nd job for the next year or so, as a roommate would only save me about $12,000/yr and I wonder if I could make up that difference some other way. I would love to hear any insight or even stories of people who were in a similar position and left someone when it was a financially difficult decision. How did it turn out for you? I feel so conflicted.

TL;DR: I bought a house and leaving my partner will mean paying most of my income toward the mortgage solo. I have severe house safety OCD due to a past roommate so am not sure how to move past that to live with a stranger again. It almost feels easier just staying with my abusive partner."	ihatecartoons	post	27.994198468658105	female	White	0.9992328882217407	na	na	na	2	relationships

It unfortunately really is :( I don't think it is talked about enough and we tend to normalize abusive behavior because it isn't coming from a man.

"TL;DR: my dad and I have had a strained relationship due to his past marriage and now wants me to accept his new relationship. Should I let go or am I justified in my anger?

My dad has been seeing this woman for some time now - roughly one to two years - and I have made little to no effort to know her. 

For context, my dad and I were never particularly close. He and my mum separated when I was 7 and growing up he would sometimes have me on weekends but I don’t remember him being around much. In more recent years our relationship had become tense because of his now ex wife. 

When I was 12 he told me that he’d met someone online (ex wife) who lived on the other side of the world and he was going to move there to be with her. Being 12 years old I didn’t really know how to react to this so I said nothing and didn’t take it seriously. Well, he moved out there for several years and I saw him a few times, once going to visit him. 

After a while he got married to her - I wasn’t told that he was getting married, nor was I invited to the ceremony as it took place in the country he lived in at the time. The marriage took place so they could both move back to my country - which they did. At this point I was into my teenage years, he had missed a lot of pivotal moments already and I had begun to feel resentful. 

Over the years I began to find his wife to be a very bitter and spiteful woman. She didn’t have a lot of nice things to say about me or anyone else really. She often put me down, and she put my mum down a lot too (my mum and dad have a good platonic relationship). I struggled a lot with education over the years and she never failed to criticise me for it.

I have a brother that is half related to me through my dad - he and my dad had a poor relationship to begin with but after my brother fell out with his mum, he moved in with my dad and his wife for a while. During this time she was very hard on my brother and he was eventually driven out of there by her, this destroyed my dad and brothers relationship and they haven’t spoken since.

Towards the end of their relationship I had separated from a long term partner and had to move in with them for a while - I had been there only two nights and she was berating me about ‘moving on’. She also would be arguing with my dad every chance she had. After this I told my dad I wouldn’t be living there any more because of her, and he said I should just ‘ignore her’. 

Their relationship finally ended because my dad couldn’t put up with her behaviour any more. Which I was glad for, and our relationship grew stronger after this, but I still felt resentful of the fact her never stood up for me against her - I still feel some trauma from having that influence in my life for 10+ years. 

And now, he has started seeing his current gf - he is seemingly head over heels in love with her. I was hesitant at first with developing a relationship with her, but his behaviour has put me off completely. He brings her to everything without asking and will not come unless she is invited. My birthday last year I wanted a meal with close family; my parents, partner and my sister, but my dad refused to come because I hadn’t invited his partner. This brought up a lot of feelings for me and I was very upset, I decided to confront him about it and he seemed pretty unbothered and just wanted to change the subject. This year, I invited him and his partner to my birthday well in advance and he ‘forgot’ and they booked a holiday for the same weekend. If I invite him to do something on a weekend he either won’t come, or will bring her because that is ‘their time’. 

I don’t feel much warmth towards her and I don’t feel compelled to form any kind of relationship with her. I have always been very introverted and not chatty with new people but I am always polite when I see her.

I wonder if I am being petty by holding onto these resentments, whether they are trivial in the grand scheme of things. Perhaps it’s normal for him to have his new partner around so much. Am I justified in feeling so angry at his (in my opinion) poor parenting, or do I need to move on and accept if I want a relationship with him at all, this is how it is?"	emma404d	post	25.502803315492645	male	White	0.9983552098274231	na	na	na	8	relationships
"No one else can dictate how trivial or important your resentments are. Your feelings are yours.

I'd be pretty put off by his behavior too. 

> Am I justified in feeling so angry at his (in my opinion) poor parenting, or do I need to move on and accept if I want a relationship with him at all, this is how it is?

The answer is likely both. Your anger is valid, AND this is how he is. He's got heavy patterning that this is just how he handles romance, and he's very unlikely to change.

And no, autism is not an excuse for this. It *might* have been until you sat him down and explained your feelings. It's not now. He's aware of how you feel, and he's chosen to continue."	emma404d	reply	na	na	na	0.9983552098274231	weak	no	no	na	relationships
"The answer to your questions is yes. 

- You're being petty punishing the new gf for the ex wife's behavior. They're not the same woman.
- It's normal for people to have their new partner around all the time, and to decline invites that purposely exclude their partners.
- Your feelings are valid.
- You need to accept this is how he/it is, and figure out how to best proceed.

"Your feelings are justified.  The curious part to me is how you are turning your sights on his girlfriend.  He's the one that you are angry with.  You get to decide if you want him around or not.  

 He's expressed his boundary of having his GF invited to family gatherings.  He's certainly within his rights to expect that.  You need to accept that they are a unit.  Reject them as a unit, or welcome them as a unit.

You don't have to be cozy with his GF, but you do need to be civil to her.  Remember that she is not your former step-mother, so don't punish her for what that woman did."	emma404d	reply	na	na	na	0.9983552098274231	no	no	no	na	relationships
I had something similar happen to me but I was much older mid 20’s when my parents divorced. One Easter my dad shows up with this woman. No idea who she is what his relationship to her is. Not even a heads up. That irked me immensely. Not that he’s with someone but a “hey I’ve been dating this woman, her name is X.

"You are certainly not wrong to feel hurt by your father's behavior. He seems to have a pattern of prioritising his girlfriends/wives over his children, which is hurtful. He may love you a lot, but he also sounds foolish and easily swept away by his romantic feelings, to the point of missing birthdays, not inviting you to his wedding, not defending you, etc. 

It doesn't sound like his girlfriend has done anything wrong, more that you have had so much disappointment and bitterness accumulating over the years. You may need to just accept that that's how he is. I have known quite a few silly men like that, where a succession of women were with him (and played him like a fiddle), while he neglected the people who needed him most and possibly loved him the most - his children. Try not to let it get to you, just be decent to them, and try to build other relationships if your father continues to be a source of hurt."	emma404d	reply	na	na	na	0.9983552098274231	weak	no	no	na	relationships

"My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years, and have been living together for 3. 
For some background, we have always had a bit of a rocky relationship due to commitment and cheating issues early on (about a year into our relationship). We had numerous conversations and I forgave him because I didn’t want to lose him. 
We have a lot of fun together and I love him very much, but I feel that our relationship never fully recovered from these issues. 

I want to preface this by saying that I am not a materialistic person, but I feel like the amount of effort reflects how much a person cares.

The past few months have been very difficult for me because I don’t feel loved or appreciated by my boyfriend. I am beginning to realize some unhealthy patterns in our relationship, and I’m beginning to bring them up to him. Due to being more upfront about my feelings, we have gotten in more fights.
 
For example, for holidays (like easter, Valentine’s Day, and halloween) I love to make baskets for people because I truly enjoy gifting things to others. I communicated this to him and I said that we should make baskets for each other to make the holidays even more exciting, and he agreed. I communicated this to him very early into our relationship and there have been multiple times where he hasn’t gotten me anything, or he has gotten me half broken items. I usually try to look on the bright side, because the thought is what counts. But.. if I’ve communicated it to him many times then there is truly no excuse for forgetting. He’s also very well off financially so why would he gift me something broken? When I bring this up to him he says things like “I’m not good enough for you” and “why are you making such a big deal about this”, among other things. It then leads to a huge fight over me not appreciating everything else he does for me. After the fight  I usually feel bad and stupid for even asking because it’s just THINGS. I just feel as if he does not care about my feelings. Also, when we go out together he often buys nice things for his family as gifts, so I know he is more than capable of caring.

Additionally, I feel as if I always put his needs before mine, and he doesn’t do the same for me. I always ask him what he would like for food, to do on the weekend, etc, but he never does the same. I recently had a birthday and the morning of he went out to the store to get something for me, and when he came back he wrapped it up and gave it to me. I thought it was nice that he got me something, but a bit sad it was last minute. I usually look forward to the cards I get because that’s where people usually put the most thought in and his card was literally blank. Later on in the day he got me a scratch off, but when we got home he didn’t even wait for me and did it all himself. I even asked him why he didn’t wait for me and he couldn’t even give me an answer. 



Am I being too sensitive, or is my relationship unhealthy?

TL; DR : my boyfriend puts minimal effort into our relationship and is not understanding of my needs. I have communicated my feelings to him, and he gets mad and starts fights.

"I’m a disappointment to my parents.

I feel so upset because my parents invest so much time and energy on me and I disappoint them with my financial decisions. I am not an addict or anything, but I make terrible decisions with my money like eating out instead of cooking food at home, and maxing out my credit cards. My goal is to take care of my parents, but they constantly have to bail me out. 

My Dad helped me finance my $38000 car in 2021. I was doing great, making the payments, my credit score was increasing and I was able to apply for credit cards, but then I lost my job after working there for nearly two years - due to me being late. Fortunately that same month I found another job, but I was also fired from that job for being late. My Dad doesn’t know this and he has had to cover over half of my rent for last month.

(I have also filed for ch. 13 bankruptcy already.)

Now, before my car gets repossessed, I have the option to complete a payment reduction form that lowers my monthly payments from $670 to $330. I had to take the form to my Dad so he can co-sign and he seemed so fed up with having to help me. Also, I basically lied to him and told him that I’m still working the two jobs. He says he can’t retire until he is 72 because he wants me to continue to be able to take care of me if I need it. I am their only daughter. I feel so bad because my goal has always been to take care of my parents, but it is not possible and my future doesn’t seem bright. 

How can I repair this financial situation? how can I repair the relationships with my parents?

TL;DR My relationship with my parents, specifically my Dad is in thin ice because I’m not competent enough to hold a job or save money."	tnh082012	post	15.150502225019686	female	White	0.9988937973976135	na	na	na	1	relationships
"Most likely you’re disappointing your father with your actions, but you’re not a disappointment.

I know, seems like splitting hairs to lean on differences between adjective and noun versions of a word, but the difference is real.

All you need to do is stop making disappointing choices. Figure out how to work making meals at home more of your routine. Freeze your credit cards. Make, *and follow* a budget. Stop showing up to work late.

"

so me and my bf have been dating for almost a year now. i was a virgin before dating him, and always wanted to have my first time with someone i had a geniune emotional connection with.although, i had AMAZING sexual chemistry with my ex and used to do very kinky stuff except for penetration becs i didn’t have a lot of resources back in my home country for abortion and was scared, along with the fact that i wanted my first time to be special.

now that i have i am in canada and have access to safe sexual contact and have built a very strong emotional connection with my current boyfriend, i have been ready to have sex with him for over 4-5 months now. i have communicated it to my partner that i want him to have roses, wine, candles or sth on our first time. while his desire to have sex with me was wayyyyyyyyyy too much at the onset of the relationship. to respect my desires, he controlled himself.

however, i feel like he has got into a habit of controlling himself so much that we don’t do anything except for blowjobs. for context, we have been living together since almost ten months as well. i have conveyed it to him that it is hard for me to control sex any longer, since i was in habit of doing sth kinky every day with my ex. he says he wants to do it too but is saving up money for it.

i don’t understand roses cost like $10. that is way less than what he spends on his marijuana addiction everyday. i highkey feel like that doing weed everyday is consuming away all his desire for sexual intimacy.

it’s just frustrating to me now. i am almost 22 , i don’t want to spend all my time watching porn or sth. it is fairly new for me to see myself initiating for these things instead of the guys and i do not like it one bit.

TL;DR i told my bf that i need time to get ready to have sex but now that i told him i’m ready, it’s been months but he didn’t initiate for sex."	laniakea__cluster	post	27.484950241259423	female	White	0.9921671748161316	na	na	na	2	relationships
Honestly I think he sees his options as either continue getting regular blowjobs or have to set up a whole romantic date night for you, and I think you are correct that if he's smoking well over $10 worth of weed a day that's a likely reason why the lazy option seems better to him.	laniakea__cluster	reply	na	na	na	0.9921671748161316	no	no	no	na	relationships
Um, just have sex with him? Why do you need a big production for this? Next time you foreplay, let it escalate. Buy some condoms or get on BC just in case, and do it. Ask him if he's not feeling it anymore, too? Why wouldn't he escalate to sex if he knows you are ready? Maybe he's nervous now and feels like there is a lot of pressure on giving you a perfect first time. You need to make the sex less about the environment and more about the present moment you two are engaging romantically.	laniakea__cluster	reply	na	na	na	0.9921671748161316	no	no	strong	na	relationships
"Excuse any formatting confusion. I had intended to post this elsewhere, but decided it would be better suited for this community.

I (34F) met my boyfriend, Nick (38M) when we were kids. He grew up in a town near mine and his late father was good friends with my uncle. We never really played together or hung out, but we tolerated each other. He moved away when I was in middle school, but I never really thought much about it. Last year, he returned to his family’s property here in Alaska, to take care of his father’s estate. His job is remote, so he decided to move into his old home and settle down. Shortly after, he reconnected with my uncle, and they became fishing buddies. This is when we took notice of one another.

We started a relationship and it's been lovely.

Now, a few things about my situation.

The pandemic messed me up. I know I’m not unique in that way, but it’s been rough. I got my PhD in Psychology in the Spring of 2020, so when I got done with that, I moved away from the bustling college town that had been my home for about 7 years. I spent two years of quarantine in the house my parents had built for me on our property just north of the Alaskan Tundra. I’ve been conducting telemedicine appointments from here ever since. Due to some horrible incidents that took place between February and May 2020 (before my move home), I grew incredibly anxious about crowded spaces, and I developed a fear of germs.  

Shortly before meeting Nick, I was officially diagnosed with panic disorder and agoraphobia (PDA). This diagnosis did not come with a clear-cut treatment plan, but I’ve still been doing my best to work through some of the less-than-rational fears.  

My mothers—Katie and Agatha—have been absolutely incredible. They have always been my best friends. And before anyone jumps to conclusions, I grew up in a home with strict boundaries and I only became “buddy-buddy” with my parents when I was in my late teens. Our relationship is healthy, and while they love that I am living within 50 feet of their house, they have helped me every step of the way with my treatment. They took me on vacation in a different state last year and they have encouraged me to go on trips with Nick as well. 

And while I’m piling on, most of my aunts and uncles (from both sides) live on our property as well. As I type this out, I’m fully aware that we sound like a weird cult full of familial red flags, but please understand that we’re all fully functional—unless alcohol is introduced to the party.  

I’m half-Iñupiat. Aga’s side of the family has owned thousands of acres of land here for centuries. On this land is a sprawling cemetery for people from our tribe and all neighboring tribes. We have owned and operated this land long before our written records. My moms are now in the main house and here they also have a funeral home and mortuary. It’s creepy as hell, but I love it here.  

And because I am the only child on both sides of the family, I am going to inherit all of it. This has been something I’ve known for years, and I’m 100% on board. 

Nick knew about all of this when we started dating last year. He was as adamant as I was about staying here permanently. He even moved in with me a few months ago and he’s started helping my uncles with work on the property.  

Last week, Nick got a job offer from a large firm in the southern US. This offer is from his boss’ boss, and they want Nick to join their team at the home site. This means that he would have to move down there by the end of September. The job comes with a huge pay increase and a ton of perks. I don’t know all the details—to be honest, I didn’t listen to a word he said after I realized he fully intended on taking the job. In my mind, this was his way of saying that he wanted to break up. But then he mentioned getting a home with an office I could work from, and I froze. 

Admittedly, I let out a small laugh at his statement. And when I said, “You think I’m going with you?”, it must have sounded a bit callous. I immediately apologized, when I realized he was bothered by this response. But I made sure that he knew that I still had no intention of moving away from my home.  

He didn’t try to fight me on it at that point. He just said, “We can discuss it as we start to make arrangements.”  

I insisted that if there was any discussion to be had, it would be in that moment, because there would be no “we” in the making of these arrangements. I reminded him of my responsibilities on the family property and in the business. And I told him that while I was willing to make steps towards the treatment of my PDA, I wasn’t ready to move so far away from my home.  

Nick tried to end the conversation, saying that decisions didn’t need to be made at that moment. I told him that I would of course give him more time to make his decision, but my decision was already made. I’m not leaving. This upset him. He said that I wasn’t compromising with him and that I had to realize that it was unrealistic to spend the rest of my life in the “middle of nowhere”. 

I told him that the “middle of nowhere” was perfect for me. 

Realizing that we were getting nowhere, he decided to leave and spend the night at his old place. I was devastated, but I agreed that it was a good idea.  

I spent the next few days at my moms’ house, crying on their couch and begging them over-and-over again for an answer as to what I should do.  

They firmly told me that it was up to me. They said that they wanted me to always be close to them of course, but they couldn’t complicate my decision with their personal requests. They did me a favor and had their respective sisters come over. My aunts aren’t afraid to give me their opinions. But they were also a little tentative in this matter.  

My mental health over the last three years seems to have burdened them more than I’d initially thought. My Aunt Gloria told me that it was vital that I be in my own space but close to loved ones so that I wouldn’t relapse—as a Mental Health specialist, I don’t entirely disagree with this. My Aunt Dawn, the free spirit who spent most of her life exploring the world outside of our town, surprisingly agreed with Gloria.  

I know it sounds like my family is just trying to keep me in their grasp. And in a sense, that’s true. But there isn’t anything toxic in their intentions.  

Last night, I spoke to Nick after nearly 5 days apart. He came over to my place and we sat on the couch for another discussion that felt like it was going nowhere. Not once did I discourage him from taking this job. I know what the opportunity means for him. I did ask if there was a chance of him working remotely in the new position, but he said it wouldn’t be possible—although I doubt, he even knew this for sure. He seems excited to move. He was pushier, telling me that I was going nowhere here and that he is my best shot at “a future”. 

I asked him to define “future”. To which he clarified.  

He’s my best chance at having a husband. And a family.  

That’s when I realized that this simply came down to us being incompatible. He’s under the impression that my sole purpose in life was to find a mate. I don’t know where that idea came from. While I enjoy being in a loving relationship, I have only ever had a few serious partners. I’m just as happy on my own.  

He continued to dig a hole when he went on to say that I would never find someone else to tolerate all my issues in addition to being willing to live on our property forever. 

That’s when I told him that I was more than happy to be on my own then. I told him I was going to my parents’ house and that he had until today to get his belongings out of my house. 

This morning, I came back, and I was shocked to find the entire first floor of my house was torn apart. He had flipped the couches over onto the glass coffee table and it looked like he chucked a bunch of my plates and glassware at the tv. The refrigerator was tipped over and it looks like he had kicked or hit it so much that it was dented in a few places.  

I called my moms immediately, and those two tiny women charged over as though they were ready to fight my 6’7 ex. When we confirmed that he wasn’t still there, we started cleaning up. I went up to my bedroom, and thankfully it was mostly untouched. There were some bloody streaks on top of the bedspread—I assume he was wounded during his temper tantrum—but that’s an easy fix. On my nightstand was a note from Nick. A stupid part of me hoped that it was a heartfelt apology for everything and that he had decided not to move away (as though he didn’t just have a red flag parade downstairs).  

While the words “I’m sorry” did appear in this note. They were immediately followed by, “but I think you’re making the biggest mistake of your life. Here is my forwarding address if you find anything else that belongs to me.” 

I crumpled it up as I fully intended on burning all remnants that he left behind.  

Obviously, I made the right call in the end, but was I irrational before this morning? Is it wrong for me to stay in a place where I feel safe rather than take a chance at a potential future with someone else?

"**tl;dr - My brother's fiancee seems to be overly controlling. I tried to bring this up with him, and now she is insisting to be on speakerphone for a follow up call.** 

I recently tried to privately share concern with my brother that his fiancee is overly controlling. The reasons I am worried about this are that myself and other family members have noticed her making comments about how he can and can't dress, how he should cut his hair, what music he can and can't listen to in the car, etc. as well as the fact that he was always very independent and had his own friends/activities/sense of style/things going on, whereas now he seems to have abandoned those things and mostly does activities she likes, with her friends. Most concerning, he has started only communicating with myself and our other family members with her on speakerphone. I have seen him in other relationships and it was never like this, which makes me think that these are not changes that he necessarily came up with on his own.

I finally was able to speak to him privately recently, and I shared these concerns. He seemed open to hearing them and acknowledged that he has changed a lot. However now, a few days later, he is asking for a follow up conversation... you guessed it... with her on speakerphone! I don't know what to make of this!

How concerned should I be that he is in a controlling/abusive relationship, and if I agree to the speakerphone conversation, what should/shouldn't I say?"	Alternative-Bit5758	post	28.69901348361155	female	White	0.9992179870605469	na	na	na	41	relationships
"Several years ago, a very close friend of mine was in a relationship that I perceived as overly controlling.  There were lots of the same symptoms that you described.  Basically, she (in my perception) pretty much quelled everything about him that made him...*him*.

When he and she planned on getting married, I raised the issue with him in confidence, out of concern for his happiness.  The very next day, he *and* she arrived at my house to Talk It All Out.

Long story short, he didn't listen, they got married...and he's *miserable*.

The thing about situations like this is that *you cannot help a person who does not want to be helped*.  

And (especially in situations like this) if you *try* to help a person who is not ready to be helped, there's every likelihood that they will dig in their heels, double down, and cling *harder* to the mistake that they are making.

What you should do is: back down.  There is *nothing* that you can say on a conference call with her, *other* than backing down, that will serve *any* purpose other than to make things worse.

Because here's the thing:  As I said above, you cannot help someone who does not want to be helped.  But.  There's always the possibility that at some time in the future, the light bulb will come on, he'll *realize* what he has been living with all these years, and he'll decide that maybe (just *maybe*) he might want to think about getting out.

And in that moment of cusp, where he could consider leaving this domineering situation, the thing that might make the decision for him about whether to get out, or to return to the devil he knows...is whether or not he thinks that you will support him.

If his impression of how you think about him and her is *negative*, if he's afraid you'll say ""I told you so"", if he feels ashamed to come to you because it'll prove that you were right all along...then there's every possibility he won't reach out.  And if he doesn't feel safe reaching out to *you*, his brother, then who else would be feel safe reaching out to?

What you have to do at this point is back down, smooth things over, and make *peace*.  Then, in the future do the following:

1. Make sure that he knows that you support *him*, no matter what, and 

2. Never *ever* say another negative thing about her.  Even if *he* says something negative about her, don't take the bait.  Validate what he's saying, with something like ""Wow, that sounds really hard.  I'm sorry you're having to deal with that"", but never say a *word* against her.  Because if he's teetering, and you say something that challenges his worldview (even if it's just by agreeing to something he has said)...it can all come crashing down and he can run back to the safety of the familiar, even if it isn't a *good* familiar.

It's time to play the long game, so that you will still *be* in the game later on if (hopefully *when*) he decides it's time to pull out of this.  Until then, be supportive of *him*, cordial and polite to and about *her*, and be *patient*."	Alternative-Bit5758	reply	na	na	na	0.9992179870605469	no	strong	no	na	relationships

Tell your brother you love him and will always value your relationship with him, no matter what form he decides that will take.

Close by saying you look forward to speaking with them both in person at the next family gathering.

"My brother is (finally) just now getting out of a 25 year marriage with a woman who's controlling and well, she's awful. She has isolated him from his whole family pretty much. We kept in touch over the phone but he only ever called me when he was on his way to work and out of her earshot. We almost never saw each other. I've never known anyone more miserable than my brother. It's been difficult to watch. But, he loved her. Probably still does, but it's she who brought up divorce for the umpteenth time and he finally said ""know what, I think I want one too"" and called her bluff. Now she's more of a nightmare than ever. Sadly, there's nothing anyone has ever been able to say or do about it. Over time he became afraid of her and codependent on top of it. Thankfully, he will finally have some damn peace now that they've split.

I would decline the group call. (Good Lord) I feel like your relationship with him will be less and less because of this bc she will insist and it seems he will do whatever she says. I wouldn't be able to help myself from expressing, however,  that this has just proved your point and there's nothing more to say. Don't apologize though.

It's fine to just say no to that, let him know you're always available to talk to him privately about anything on his mind, and that you love him. And just leave it at that. You've let him know your concerns, now the best thing you can do is just keep being a loving presence in his life.

"Sounds abit like my partners ex she was a narcissist, she put walls between him and all his family and friends until he was isolated with just her. The best thing you can do is not speak up, it only pushes them closer to the abuser, they'll then play victim to the real victim and be like ""see only I care about you, they don't"" or ""you never stand up for me"" so then the victims will argue over the smallest things with family and friends just to prove themselves to the abuser. Perhaps he went back and told her to try get her approval? Did she love bomb him at the beginning? If she's a narc they work slow for months they will be the perfect partner then slowly chip away at your confidence and wheel you back in and repeat then make comments about friends and family so then the victim second guesses his/her family and friends, their manipulative, gaslighting, the victim then becomes afraid. My partner's ex would use other ways of control she would beat him, r@pe him, tell him he isn't a real man, tell him his hobbys were childish (he loved warhammer and playing video games but she ruined it for him), she tried to unalive him several times, isolated him from all family and friends. My neice is now in a simular relationship we all act like we're fine with the guy and it's hard! But we all know from my experience and my partners if you say don't it pushes the victim towards the abuser, first relationship that was abusive nobody said anything my family were supportive and quiet that relationship lasted 3 years I eventually left second relationship my sister kept begging me to leave I ended up marrying him and stayed 7 years, my larter his mum she shared her concerns and he stayed with his ex over 10 years.   My neice has been with her abuser 1 year and has tried to leave several times, that's a whole bunch more than what me and my partner ever tried to do! So not speaking up is best, showing love and support that if you need them you're there, there is a safe space whenever they need it. Ofcouse it's hard you want to protect and save but most of the time it only pushes them towards the abuser. Maybe do things like casually sticking on a documentary about narcissists (if you believe she is one) then no doubt the victim will have their eyes opened. Never tell a narc you're learning about narcissism they will read and learn to hide it better, never tell them you think their the narc they will tell you and others how you're the narc often then make the victim believe that their the narc. Love and supprt is best. It's hard I know but it makes them leave much faster! Might take 3 years but it's better that 7-10."

Yes. The problem with the speakerphone chat is that she'll use it against you and your family to cut ties permanently. To further isolate him. She'll demonize and weaponize everything you say as this horrible attack on her. She knows what she's doing and unfortunately with him under her spell, he'll eat it up and just do what she says. It's incredibly sad. My first instinct is like yours, to use logic, love and concern. The fact that he so quickly ran to her and told her everything and got her back in the helm shows he's not ready to see reality. It sucks when this happens.

Follow with all those reasons you listed as to you backing up your thoughts. It may be worth to mention that it's not only you but others as well. Why do you have to hold in your thoughts just because they're a relative?? He even told her about the conversation and is now making you confront her instead of taking the advice in stride and trying to see if he consciously is doing these changes because she says so. I've been the relative who didn't listen to their families advice and that relationship didn't last but 1 to 2 years. The fact that they cut back contact with me because of it opened my eyes and honestly I'm glad they not only told me but doubled down on their stance by speaking to me less.

If there's any chance at all to get him into therapy under some other pretense, that would be huge. But it don't see his abuser allowing a one on one session with someone who can snap him out of their hypnose.

I think it's just standby and watch for now. He's a grown up and has the right to do his own mistakes."	Alternative-Bit5758	reply	na	na	na	0.9992179870605469	weak	no	no	na	relationships

"This was 2 months ago exactly for reference!

On my birthday, the guy who I am romantically involved with and exclusive with (we had been in agreement on this for months prior) came to my hometown to spend a few days with me, the first of which was my birthday. 

We went to lunch at a favorite restaurant of mine and during he formally asked me to be his girlfriend. I was overjoyed, as I really do adore him. He had been saying for a good chunk of time prior that he was going to ask me formally sometime. He had been hinting for a bit prior to my birthday that he had a surprise for me, and turns out, that was the surprise.

He had broke his phone a week or so before this and had to buy a new one so he told me he was low on money prior to coming to town. 

I’m just a little disappointed that he didn’t get me anything for my birthday. He didn’t even get me a card and I paid for both of our meals.

 I don’t expect lavish gifts or much at all from him as I had told him in the past. I don’t want to come off as materialistic or needy, but I’m just a little sad he couldn’t even write out a card. I know that it was my first birthday with him in our new relationship, but I’m a little bit hurt by this. I mean, you can get a card for 50¢ at some dollar stores. 

I’m conflicted if I should even bring this up with him. Is it worthwhile for me to do so yet?

TLDR: My boyfriend didn’t get me a card for my birthday or anything at all. Should I talk to him about it?"	no_worries17	post	31.842598791365944	female	White	0.9955998659133911	na	na	na	114	relationships
"Having read your comments and reading that your boyfriend who is employed full time as a security guard, while you are a student and recovering from surgery yet you pay for his gas, and the majority of meals I think the issue goes beyond the fact that he didn't do anything for your birthday, and imo goes beyond needing to just talk to him about it. I think this is a huge red flag that you may be dating a hobosexual. What effort is he putting into this relationship? It's early days, when partners are usually giving their best effort, is this really what you want in a partner if this is his best?

You can't pull anyone else out of the tar pit if you're stuck in it with them. 

But first and foremost, the best you can do is communicate. Tell him how you felt a bit unappreciated.

You need to have a conversation to set that expectation. Tell him you don't need lavish gifts but on your birthday (and which ever other holidays thisnapplies to), it does mean a lot to you to get a gift. That it makes you feel loved bc it's a sign that someone takes time out of their daily life to spend time to think about you and wanting to make you happy. That writing out a sweet card can do that too. I had to set that expectation with my fiancé early on. I even told him I was having weird feelings bc I didn't want to be materialistic and emphasized it isn't what the gift is but the time and thought spent behind the gift. He is now the sweetest gift giver, each one is well thought out.

"Hey OP, 

I would be saying something that not many people will agree with.

""Talk to him about this"".

There are 5 ways of displaying your love.

1. Gifts
2. Words of affirmation
3. Acts of service
4. Quality time
5. Physical touch

(There are more ways than these 5, but these 5 ways are kind of modern day things that can help to show your affection)

No one can be good at all 5 forms. People are hardly good at even 3 out of 5. It might also happen that you value gifts more, and your bf might value quality time more. 

Talk to him and let him know that gifts are an important gesture for you. Appreciate him for all the things he did your birthday. And politely put that - You are happy for everything he did for your birthday still a gift is an important form of love for you. "" Listen to his reasons and explainations. He will surely give the reason as money crunch.

If he is mature, he will understand that and keep this in mind next time. If he dosent, only then you take your next steps.

Okay, before reddit army bashes me, I am telling this from personal experience. At some point, I was lousy in gift giving and also had a lot of financial crunch.

"Was he raised in a family that celebrated birthdays? I have found out more and more that this isn't as common as I thought it was, and sometimes I've had to set the example and role model what I've thought was usual birthday etiquette. 

Also, have you read the Love Language book and shared the quiz results with each other? This information may be very telling?

Has your boyfriend made some financial mistakes or has his family not done things which have made it possible / easy for him to live independently and responsibly (financially)? Is he deeply in debt? 

Unless there are some major surprises above about which you need to be super sensitive, then you need to simply have a short, super-direct conversation with him at a time when there isn't conflict. In person. Tell him you need to talk to him about something important regarding your relationship. Then, when you meet, tell him you've noticed an inequality in effort between the two of you regarding your outings, doing things for each other, etc. Then, give him the example of your birthday and that you were not expecting much necessarily because of his phone issue... but that you're talking more about creativity, effort, and intentionality than money. And, then reiterate that you'd like there to be more balance between the two of you... and ask him if he has any questions. 

I've read some of your replies and am kind of shocked by some of the things happening in your relationship. After the discussion, you just have to gauge if he understood the request and if he is going to back that up in effort and actions. If not, it may just not be ""his thing"" and it might be a major incompatibility between  the two of you.

">I’m just a little disappointed that he didn’t get me anything for my birthday.

How much was the trip to your town?

I dunno, I can understand that you might feel a little underwhelmed, but also from his perspective he went through a lot of effort (and maybe spent a decent chunk of change) to come see you and then initiated an important relationship milestone. So he might feel like he did plenty.

Same thing happened to me. I was in-between jobs, funds were low and the GF still expected me to blow wads of cash on her for her birthday. We have since broken up, but we keep in touch. During the relationship, if a situation came up where she could ridicule me for it, she never hesitated.

"It sounds like irresponsibility but without more information it’s hard to judge. If he works full time he should be doing alright, as long as he’s being somewhat responsible, living with a roommate if he’s in a high cost of living area, not paying for an expensive car, not putting money into vices like weed or alcohol or partying. If he’s broke after buying a new phone he could’ve bought a cheaper one. You don’t need to get an iPhone 14 pro max, you can get an iPhone SE and still do everything you need to do and have money leftover to get your girlfriend a gift for her birthday.

There are certainly communication issues (“I appreciate gifts for important events and you let me down”) but general adulthood responsibility is also a factor in compatibility.

Also, I just think different walks of life approach relationships differently. My partner and I had the girlfriend/boyfriend talk just randomly one night and it was great, other people want it to be an event.

"I \[f28\] recently developed a crush on my coworker, let's call him Dave \[m29\]. Me and Dave have worked in sister teams under the same manager for 1.5 years. Our work doesn't overlap much and most of our interactions are during lunch or AWs etc.

I wasn't at all interested in Dave previously. I'm quite extroverted and usually I fall for others who are more talkative. But Dave is not. He is more the quiet type. I'm usually quite confident and can even be flirty when I like someone. But I think that Daves more quiet nature as well as that he feels a bit awkward around me and that we are at work makes me a lot more nervous and unsure of myself. I just don't know how to interact with him, and him acting a bit hot and cold makes me feel insecure.

About half a year ago I had a suspicioun that Dave liked me. All of a sudden he started coming up to me and ask me about my weekend etc. He didn't do it often, maybe once a week, and I have seen him do the same to other coworkers, mostly the ones in his team or the ones he's closer with. But since he hadn't done it with me before and we generally didn't talk much, this change caught me of guard. He also started asking me and his friend (whom I sit next to) everyday if we were joining the restaurant at lunch or had lunch box (half the group usually go the same time everyday to the restaurant, the rest eat their own food in the kitchen). I also caught him looking at me twice during a bigger meeting, but I'm not sure if I was looking at him first, since I was a bit more aware of him due to my suspicion. I felt like he was slightly awkward around me most time and we usually didn't have much to say to each other. I wasn't interested in him then and I have misinterpreted men's interest in me before, so I decided to just ignore it. I never caught him looking at me again (although I was paying no more attention to him). The other things kept happening and felt mostly just like polite coworker interactions.

Then about a month ago we had a friday AW and me and Dave ended up at a club together with two friends of another coworker. We were just dancing and having fun. When the club closed me and Dave accidentively lost the other two. It was early morning and I was trying to figure out how to get home as my buses weren't going. Dave offered that I could crash at his place since he lived closer. I think he was genuinly just trying to help, he doesn't strike me as the guy who would've had alterior motives. But I declined and instead we shared a cab that first dropped him off and then me. I dreamt about him that night. And the next day I couldn't stop thinking about him. He wrote to me that morning and asked if I got home alright. 

I spent the following week trying to talk to him and figure out wheather he might be into me. Whenever I was talking to him he seemed to enjoy the conversation. He was smiling and laughing when I made jokes, but it was still very much just polite and friendly. In group settings I often talk a lot, whilst he is more passive. So often it was me and some of the other more chattier coworkers driving the conversation and he was listening. Whenever I looked over at him he was smiling back at me. At one point during lunch I was talking only to him. I don't remember about what, but I was trying to be funny and bubbly. He did smile towards me, and then blush and look away. Which to me seems like good signs.

At a later point though we were in a meeting together which I was facilitating. During this meeting I got this weird and awkward feeling from him. Except for the two times I directed a question two him, he completely avoided eye contact and was looking in another direction, even though I was doing a lot of the talking or talking to the person sitting next to him. 

I then went on vacation and he came back from vacation yesterday. I had decided to try to act more cool so I don't start acting love sick around him. Even though I had gotten some mixed feelings previously I was hoping maybe to see signs of him liking me. We talked a bit about our vacation in the morning when we saw each other, but other than that we didn't interact much and I decided to not look at him or pay him too much attention during the day, as I normally wouldn't have. We later ended up on the same bus (which we usually don't, but I was going to my parent's) and he basically ignored me on both the bus stop and on the bus. I was standing on the bus, facing the direction where he was sitting, and only when he got up to get off the bus did he acknowledge me and awkwardly say hello. 

Today I brought cakes for all of our coworkers (we take turns bringing something for the coffee break). Me and Dave were sitting at opposite ends of the table. I broke my plan to not look at him and he and I locked eyes like 3 times. I'm not sure who was looking at whom first. I could see him in the corner of my eye, and everytime his head was in my direction I looked at him and he looked at me. It might have been he was just facing my direction and noticed that I was looking at him every time. But since I looked at him several times it was probably super clear that I like him. After a while he got up, politely thanked me for the cakes and left. When I got back to my desk later he had already left the office. I got this extreme dread that maybe he is not into me at all and maybe I just made him super uncomfortable. Maybe he even left office early because of this. I don't know how to interpret his behaviour and I don't know how to proceed. I really really don't want to make a fool out of myself at work and the thought of him seeing me as clingy and annoying and that I make him uncomfortable makes my skin crawl. What do I do? (except talking to him about this. Which would hardly make things less awkward than they already are. I do have to see him every day at work.)

I know I basically sound like a highschool student crushing on a classmate. I guess somethings don't change.

TL;DR I \[f28\] have developed a crush on my shy coworker \[m29\] who sometimes acts a bit awkwardly around me. I don't know if I make him nervous because he likes me or if I make him uncomfortable because he has noticed that I like him and he doesn't feel the same."	ulalola	post	27.43641864350582	female	White	0.002456443617120385	na	na	na	6	relationships
"Why don't you ask him out? You declined his first invitation to crash at his place, this was definitely him shooting his shot. If he's shy or gets rejected a lot, maybe he gave up after that.

If you want, you can even find a cool event near by and tell him that you're going, and ask people around you if they want to join you- him included.

"I (23F) and my partner (25F) have been together almost 2 years. I went away to college 5 1/2 hours away to a town next to where she grew up, which is where I met her. When I graduated, I moved back home and we did long distance for a while and realized it was not for us. My parents offered her to move in with us and work here until we found somewhere to live together and get our own apartment. (the location I am in is in between 2 large cities and has a lot of job opportunities and things to do and we thought it would make more sense for her to come here since I don’t think I could find a job in my field if I moved near her small home town.) I never cared about moving to different areas and trying new things (I don’t have much holding me to my hometown area) but the one thing I always wanted to be in a city or suburbs of a city. I had always grown up in the suburbs and I am used to having those resources and fun things around me (and I am also a really big concert goer too which makes it easier.)


Since living with me for about 8 months (longer than we wanted or expected), she has expressed that she is not happy here and wants to be close to her family. She is VERY VERY family oriented and all of them still live in her small, country town and it is rare for one of them to leave. When we visit them often, she tends to shut me out and puts all of her attention on them and it makes me feel more of an outsider than I already am. Her family is shy and close-knit within themselves and rarely talks to me directly and I fear she would want to see them ALL of the time if we were closer to them, which is another reason I am hesitant, because of how I am treated by her there.


I offered to make a compromise and see if we could live in one of the closest cities from her hometown which is about 2 hours away. She believes this may not be enough for her and wants to be closer but also wants me to come with. I don’t want to chose a location over her and neither does she with me but I cannot give up everything I want in doing so. I figured that would be the best and only compromise without breaking up completely because that is not even the ideal city, state, or place I would have chose anyway but I am open to it for the compromise and for her. But she is iffy about it which makes me sad. 


TL;DR ) she wants to move back to her small hometown and I want to live near a city. I thought a compromise would be the best option so we don’t have to break up but she doesn’t know if she can do that. I need advice on what we should do!

If your gf is this family oriented, there's no way she's going to change- her family will always come first and be a huge part of your life, and you will continue to feel a bit shut out or like your needs are secondary. Personally I would end things because I'm not interested in dating someone who is that family oriented and unwilling to compromise for me.	winnie-bot	reply	na	na	na	0.9831941723823547	no	no	no	na	relationships
"Anything in-between that small town and the nearest city to be close enough for day trips? Is either of your chosen careers even feasible in the small town? You definitely shouldn't move there if you won't be happy or can't work. It sounds like it will be a permanent move for her.

One thing to consider is that she'd probably want to be visiting family more often than you'd be going to concerts. You could also think about which resources you'd miss and if you could plan around access being further out. There are things to do in small towns just different things and often under your own power.

The family dynamics is a major concern. As is the lack of any compromise on her part. You could just ask her straight up how she might willing to compromise or how she might address your concerns. It sounds like you put up some ideas so ask her about what her ideas are."	winnie-bot	reply	na	na	na	0.9831941723823547	weak	no	strong	na	relationships
I don’t know what you do for a living but I know that remote work is becoming more and more viable today. As part of your thought process before making any decision I suggest making a weighted pros and cons list of locations you want to be. Give more weight to things you love and less to those that are less important to you (keep your results to yourself and shred them up after). But this is also a good time to sort out what you want and need in a relationship, how well does your significant other fit into those requirements?	winnie-bot	reply	na	na	na	0.9831941723823547	weak	no	no	na	relationships
"Sorry this is so long and probably doesn’t make much sense but there is a lot going on and I feel like I can’t vent to anyone else.

First, a very basic history of our relationship, me and ‘Mike’ get together when we are 16 and are each others first. We are so in love, we share so much together and bond over our love and same tastes in cinema, music etc. I never thought I would find someone like this. Seriously, we were incredible together and everyone knew how in love we were.

There is one small thing at the start. After our very first date he sends me a message meant for someone else talking about inappropriate pictures. I am livid but he’s sorry and I forgive him. Thinking back I wish I took this as a warning.

After a while, we break up for a silly reason when we are 17 but carry on sleeping together. Then I find breast lumps which I talk about with him, he even felt them. In the November I have an operation to remove them and he doesn’t check on me, no message or anything. Then a few months later in January we have a one night stand, he ignores my message the next day. This left me very hurt and in June/July when we are 18 I got a new boyfriend. 

Note that this boyfriend had messaged me after my op saying he hopes I’m okay after seeing a social media post. We were platonic and didn’t really speak much until that summer. He started speaking to me and asking me out, I thought ‘wow someone actually cares for me’. When I broke the news to ‘Mike’ that we were together he was devastated. I still loved him but thought I deserved better. This is one of my biggest regrets.

Also, in the months before we break up he has a friend group and starts getting close to one of the female friends, let’s called her ‘Max’. She always acted strange towards me but I thought whatever.
This will be relevant later.

By next summer the new boyfriend and I had broken up. Me and ‘Mike’ are 19 and have rekindled things and are in love again. It was difficult because we’d slept with other people and were both struggling with that. I find out that he and ‘Max’ slept together and he took her virginity which absolutely killed me. He says it started after I had the new boyfriend. Despite the challenges and history we focused on our otherworldly love. We’d lay together and look into each others eyes listening to our songs. I was so in love I felt like I couldn’t breathe in moments like this.

Then we are 21 and 22 and I’ve been spending lots of time in his flat as we are planning on moving in together when I get a new job. However, I have bad feelings and go through his laptop and Instagram, terrible I know, but I find he has been flirting with a model. I told him about this and he said I misunderstood, that he was speaking to her about work and didn’t intend for it to come across as flirting, he’s sorry I misunderstood. And his is understandably mad I went through his things. This is strike 1.

Then 3 months ago. We are playing on his phone and when we were sharing pictures there were 2 suggested Snapchat contacts. Both girls. I ask who they are and he says one he met one on a night out 6months before (but they don’t properly speak much) and the other is someone who posted porn on her story and he messaged her saying something like “what’s this lol”. These are minimal things but hurt me still. He says he’s sorry and it won’t happen again and I try to forgive. Strike 2.

This occurred around 2 months after we start renting a house together, a 1 year contract.

The next incident was a couple weeks ago, we have been living together for over 4 months. We are on a night out and speaking to 2 groups. I am talking to a bunch of girls we met saying he was my boyfriend and gushing over him to them. He is in a group next to us with 2 friends before girls come over. He one armed hugged a girl that he met earlier that night. I thought fine whatever that is okay. Then I continue speaking to the girls and one says “isn’t that your boyfriend?”. I turn and see him skipping (yes skipping) away with the girl holding hands for a few seconds before he lets go. I am humiliated. The group breaks up and he comes to find me, I give him a piece of my mind. He says sorry and he was being a wingman for one of this friends. I am so close to breaking up with him. Strike 3.

It is that incident that makes me think ‘I will not marry him anymore’. We are now 23 and have imagined a future together but now I am shattered.

Over the last few weeks I have been composing my thoughts and thinking about what to do. I decide to go through the laptop again to compile a history of our relationship so I can write my feelings out in a letter, just for me.

I discover the pictures of him in ‘Max’s’ house, 2 days after my operation when he ignored me. Then pictures of her in ‘Mike’s’ house around the time of the one night stand. I go through his notes and see that from around the March at least, a couple months after the one night stand, he has either been fantasising about having sex with her or he actually has. But I can’t mention this information because of how I got it when going through his stuff. But also this is history when we weren’t officially together, should I even be bothered?

Besides the above we have/had an amazing relationship. I think I want to leave him but I’m scared I won’t find anyone else so perfect for me. There is so much history, we have become adults together. I don’t want to deal with sexual trauma with anyone else.

There is 8 months left in our tenancy. Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks all!

TLDR; my bf has betrayed my trust and I found out he lied about things while we were broken up. I think I want to leave him but I don’t think I’ll find someone so perfect for me

"TL;DR my Bf just moved across the country to move in with me, it was his idea. He's now saying he's not ready and is going to go back after less than 2 weeks, and a ton of money spent. I feel completely lost not sure what am suppose to feel here or do. 

I get some of his issues but I also don't. I've not been in his situation, but I am in this one. He got divorced last year and has had a tough time recouping after we started seeing each other a few month after his divorce was finalized and had a few trips to see each other, before he said he wanted to move. His therapist even said he'd made remarkable recovery. 

So after 8 Mos he decided to move we made plans now he's here and he hates the weather it's 122 index this week not normal at all, but it's usually an index of 90. 

I wasn't expecting him to cry everyday and be continually sorry. He made a choice now he's just giving up and ready to high tail it out. Call it homesick call it weak willed, I was not expecting this. 

I feel totally cheated WTH, I'm pretty sure I'm better off without this but I wasn't expecting him to do this. 

I hate the dating scene it's really not a good place these days. Honestly I'm pretty hurt by this not sure I'll recoup. My feelings are shattered."	away96926	post	30.393134751788175	female	White	0.9994950294494629	na	na	na	14	relationships

"Burner account;

So me (21 M) and this girl (we can call Ari 23 F) met through a club a few years ago. We had no direct interactions for a while - she had a boyfriend at this time and I was talking with other people and we did not overlap. Anyways, we slowly became friends through this club while she had a boyfriend and started hanging out one on one despite the boyfriend not liking this. She had a whole laundry list of complaints about him and how miserable she was with him. Ari ends up dumping the old boyfriend as I told her she can’t hang out with me and have a boyfriend and I would leave the picture as I didn’t feel right. Looking back it was emotional cheating 

She enters a relationship with me and keeps ties with old bf as “she was worried for his mental health”. I gave her a couple months of this and eventually told her she had to stop and cut him out. She said she did until a few weeks later she gets a call from him. This was a big issue as she violated trust and made me question her entirely. She said she felt horrible and blocked him and would never unblock him. 

Fast forward another month. We are on a vacation which I paid for entirely as a treat for her. On the second night while I was using the bathroom, she unblocks her ex and messaged him happy birthday on a burner Instagram account. 

She continues messaging him for 3 months. Amongst these months, she plans breakup dates with me, meets him in person, creates private playlists for him, sends him jokes I made up, steals life stories about me and uses them about her, says she “loves him”, basically just stabs me in the back. 

Her ex wanted to get back with her so he gave her an ultimatum that either she dated him or he tells me what’s happening.

On the last month, we went on another vacation where I wanted to breakup afterwards due to her mental health sharply declining and her mood dragging on. She did not want to go through with this and cried for days. We decide not to end it near my birthday. On my birthday her mood drags again; we didn’t do any of the things I wanted to do because the day became about her and her depression. The next day we had plans which she canceled so her ex could show up at her house while her parents are gone. She let my phone calls ring out and ignored my texts. 

Eventually I find out because it was the ultimatum day her ex gave her. She told me she gave me all of the information but she did not. Her ex messaged and called me all for the next week as she blocked him after I broke up with her and told him she hated him. We both realized how manipulative and miserable she was for years. She maliciously played with both of our emotions and admitted to it

I blocked her completely that night for about a week and then we started communicating again after she created new email accounts to spam me with

It has been about a month of communicating. I have read through all of the messages she had with her ex and know almost the entire picture. There was no physical cheating. She is wanting to make things work and is seeing a therapist every other week.

I believe she has BPD as well as a few other issues. I am still very much so angry at her. She keeps saying that she loved and still loves me throughout the whole thing but I think it is bs. She is trying to do cutesy things I tried doing earlier in the relationship but it seems so odd now. She keeps saying she doesn’t want to loose me and how I mean so much to her but why would she have done this otherwise? Not only this but recently her cat died and she seems to be 10X more upset over the cat than me. The emotional connection feels so blunt and there is underlying despise towards her. I still feel she is lying and even after she was confronted she gaslight me and emphasized how there was no intentions whatsoever to get back with her ex and that she just wanted a friend. 

Ari cheated 2 times, 3 if you include the first unblocking, and has a clear history of lying and manipulation. She has no friends any more as she has burned every bridge she has ever made over the course of her life with past friends. She currently lives with her parents who she claims are abusive. She has issues with depression, BPD, anxiety, depression, etc. and I am unsure if she is even able to be trusted given her issues. Not only this but I lack the spark I used to have. 

She was uninvited from my family vacation this summer which I missed due to her as well. She was also uninvited from my sisters wedding in the winter. 

We have been hanging out again for about 2 months now and the question of what to do next has been looming over for quite some time. It all feels very weird. I am not even big on relationships myself as I am on the autism spectrum so I just feel very disconnected from this entirely and my emotions are very shut down. I don’t know what to do from here

TL;DR ex girlfriend emotionally cheated on her ex with me. Entered a relationship with me and violated trust once, begged for forgiveness, and then emotionally cheated for another 3 months with her old ex. She has many mental health issues and is trying to address them and wants to make things work between us. I am unsure of how I feel or what I want to do"	NearbyAd1840	post	28.346498061071774	female	White	0.9981340765953064	na	na	na	3	relationships
"She emotionally cheated on her ex to be with you. She then emotionally cheated on you to be with her ex. And now that she's lost both of you, she wants to ""make it all better""? She's caused you to miss a family vacation. You've mostly lost feelings for her. You two will have significant trust issues because you'll always be wondering if she's cheating once again.

"People on Reddit are SO quick on jumping aboard the ""he's cheating"" it drives me insane aha.

It's a text from a long time ago. I'm assuming brother is older, they have been together for ages and SIL feels like your bf is her little brother kinda.

Guess what ? Maybe he did tell her that your date went great. Maybe he asked her AND brother to sneak in to smoke a joint, or have a drink or something else he would not be really proud of and not wanting to tell you - and does not need to. Maybe they were in an awful family dinner that night and he wanted to chill with SIL.
Unless you have other real, valid reasons not to trust him, this is just a text.

However, you need to wonder why do you not trust him and why do you go through his phone.
Cheating or not is not the issue here, it's the trust issue. Seems like you need to break up, you are not happy in this relationship."	Ambitious_Location21	reply	na	na	na	0.9944607019424438	no	no	no	na	relationships
"I'm baffled by the amount of people justifying internal insecurities being projected on the bf as an excuse for why it ok for the OP to go through her bf's phone. There is no good excuse or reason. 

On the otherhand, if the bf is/was cheating, then he is absolutely liable. What I'm confused about is whether this text was sent before or after OP and the bf got together. If not, then this is absolutely a bad look on OP's part.

If it were me, and I found that after we got together, I'd sort it out through the brother or sister in-law, else I'd just keep it pushing.

Either way, this whole relationship is a shit show based strictly on the OP's deep seeded insecurities. Whether OP has a hunch or not, this was not the right way. Ultimately this will end bad, break up two relationships, destroy a family, and Reddit will laugh it up as it burns.

There really aren’t that many people having affairs with their family members in real life. Will some people have sexual fantasy about in-laws? Likely. But will sane people act on it? I don’t think so. Let a fiction plot stays fictional. Real life is not the same as porn where people get on their step family or in-law’s bed that easily. If you are worried about something that has a very low possibility to happen, then this is a paranoid rather than a sound suspicion. Get help, and try to remember that you can have emotions, but they are not always the right guidance for your behaviors. You can also feel the emotions but not act on it.

"Looks like you don't have reason to trust him. But seems like he doesn't have reason to trust you either. 

Don't stay with a cheat. But work on your own issues as well. I feel like people always give the first part of this advice but neglect the latter. If you are insecure and you have trust issues then go be single and work on them. Insecurity often comes down to not trusting yourself more than anything. Feeling less than and unworthy of love. When you are single it feels like you will never find love, and once you do you can't understand why they would choose you. So you become mistrustful. The other side of the coin is that people who will cheat are the first to pick up on your insecurities. It's easy to daylight and manipulate someone who is already hurt.

"Always trust you gut, but you made the mistake in telling him how you found this out, you lead with your emotions and not your head. So lets assume he cheated on you, you have now taught him how to hide it better and delete the evidence. If anything comes up again in the future try go for a walk and settle your emotions then think of your next step and always send yourself the evidence. Now if he has deleted said text I would be even more suspicious because I'd be thinking what are you hiding if it was all so innocent? The thing is you don't know anything you let your emotions take over when you should have looked more into it all because if he's up to no good he now has cleared up his phone. I say this all from experiance, I was married to a man for 7 years who constantly cheated, every time I had a gut feeling I was right, every time he accused me of cheating (which I never did) it was him who had cheating. So if anything trust your gut even if you don't have evidence if you feel in your gut that anxiety and like he's probably lying and gaslighting and manipulating you. Trust is so important in a relationship if he has broken your trust he isn't the one. You can't find your Mr Right if you're with Mr Wrong. Also look at watching Mathew Hussey on YouTube or Tiktok he'll teach you alot about men. That man helped me find the most perfect parter for myself and we get married next year.

Why did you had the need to go through his phone? I personally believe phone password, email passwords shouldn't be shared. Trust is Trust...it's not built by knowing each others passwords, code. Some things in a relationship needs not to be shared with your spouse.

"Comments here are wild. One: do not go through his phone. If you have a question or feel insecure, ask him. There could be a million reasons why he said that to her, we (reddit strangers) don't know him or her or how their relationship is. I would a million percent send that to my best friend's wife with absolutely 0 mal intent because that's who she is and that's who I am. Instead of saying ""can you come to my room to talk"" I'd say ""can you sneak in here real quick!"" Or something. Especially if I'm giddy after a date.

I think it warrants some inner searching first: why don't you believe him? Is the relationship inappropriate in any way? Has your trust been betrayed? If so, then you need to convey that and tell him you're struggling to trust. It's a tough conversation but if you want it to work, you have to work with it together. If not and you're just feeling insecure, then find out why! Is it self esteem? Is it past issues from previous relationships? These also need to be conveyed but the good news is that these are you problems and conveying them is an act of mutual trust which is just way better. You should say ""hey, I have an issue with this. I realize it's a me problem but I would just hope that you could be sensitive to me on the subject and I'll try and tell you if I'm feeling prickly for any reason."" And if he's into you and compassionate then this will be a wonderful positive experience. If he's not then fuck him you deserve better than that sister fucker (joke).

"While I feel going through someone else’s phone without permission is really inappropriate, at this point you’ve already done it and now have to figure out how you feel about this.

Personally, I don’t like it at all. There’s no reason to “sneak” if everything is on the up and up unless it’s like a surprise party or something. If he wanted to tell her about your date and they are close, then it would have been something saying about the date or even just something about talking when she has time. The fact “sneak” is in there is really what throws me off.

I know you mentioned in another comment about going to therapy. I’d continue to do that and bring this incident up. I have a lot of anxieties and some of those involved trust issues and going to therapy and specifically working on those issues really helped me over the years. My husband also came to therapy with me sometimes when we first started dating because he wanted to try and understand my anxieties and how best he could help me with them. Granted by the time we started dating I’d already been doing a lot better, but I still needed reassurances sometimes.

Also to add, regardless of the reason you went thru his phone. You should work on that. Obviously you saw a reason to. But that should be reason enough to end the relationship—-no trust. Moreover, work on your own trust stuff before your next relationship or the trust issue will continue into the next one even if you’ve found a gem of a partner.

Way too little information included in this post to be able to make a fair judgment of the situation. Did you have a fair reason for going through his phone? It is that something that you just do casually because you are insecure about the relationship ship? Did you suspect something about the SIL? What is their relationship like at the moment? In general if this type of stuff is going on so early in the relationship wether something is going on between them or not it’s not a stable ground for a long term relationship.

"Your relationship is not great. In fact, it’s not even good. If you’re going through his phone, your relationship is dead. Either you have no reason to not trust him which going through his phone is a total violation, or he has cheated and that’s why you don’t trust him. Either way, this relationship is toxic and it’s over. Just know that while you continue to stay, you don’t have a good relationship and it’s very unhealthy. 

The whole “our relationship is great except this one huge problem that has broken our relationship beyond repair”…. I mean, that’s not how any of this works. At all. And you probably won’t have a healthy relationship with anyone until you understand that. 

I’d tell you to leave, but really doubt you’ll do it, because one of you should’ve left by now anyway.

"Here's what I've learned with relationships - life is too short to be with someone you don't trust. And never discount your intuition. Regardless of whether they ever did anything or not, but dollars to donuts, they did do something to not be trustworthy.   


You're young and have the whole world in front of you. Don't get tied down to a partner that makes you feel insecure. I remember being that person until I met my partner nearly 20 years ago. Not once have I ever felt the need to snoop through their phone. Never have I even questioned any major life decision with them - moving in together, buying a house together, getting married, etc. But previous relationships? Every single one of them was untrustworthy in one way or another, and most of them were cheaters.

"Ok just want to preface that I am super against going through a partners phone. That’s a boundary that I don’t think people should cross. Also as a “long time” girlfriend in my boyfriends friend group, I have been asked similar requests from his friends for just that- to talk about the girl they are seeing in private so they don’t have to share it with the whole group. 

Why did he need his SIL to “sneak into his room”? You should be asking yourself that. Is there a reason this conversation had to be private? Is there some context behind your boyfriends relationship with his brother that we’re missing here? Like his brother is a dick but he’s really close with his sister in law? Also, how long has she been in the family? Does he have any other girl friends he could talk to? If not, then think about that. Maybe he feels comfortable talking to her about girl-stuff. Are you trying to understand the full picture, or do you want to be mad?

So your boyfriend is obviously being devious,this a huge red flag. That type of text indicates that either he is messing around with the sister in law or they have a secret connection outside of your relationship. The fact you are insecure is also a big issue for the relationship. This doesn't seem to be a healthy connection between the two of you. The fact you are going through his phone also shows had bad things are between the two of you. Your self esteem seems to be very low so you allow him to get away with these things and focus only on the good moments, this is why you bring up the fact the relationship is great, when in reality it isn't. You can ignore reality, but you can not ignore the consequences of ignoring reality. If you can not trust, there can not be true love.

You know the way that most people find infidelity is through snooping right? Not saying that snooping is right, but rather a symptom of baggage (that would warrant therapy) or a partner exhibiting untrustworthy behaviour. She already didn't have much trust, either cause she has trust issues or he's given her a reason to be suspicious or both. You've said that if he is cheating, it's justified- so why does that make her any less regardless if he is cheating or not? It's a suspicious text message out if context. It's sorta weird that out of all places he wants her to sneak out to, it's his bedroom. Like if I wanted to speak to my SIL it wouldn't be in my bedroom, it would likely be elsewhere. But either way, she can either find out that she's been cheated on or that her BF and SIL had an affair OR that she needs to learn how to trust, either option doesn't seem bad considering.

"He probably got mad because she went through his phone to begin with. Obviously don't know the history of the relationship, but she offered that she went through his phone due to her insecurities. If he hadn't given her reason not to trust him prior to the message, she shouldn't have gone through his phone. If any trust was broken here simply based on the op, she's broken his.

But, now that we're here, the message is sketch on its own without context. If you don't buy his reason for sending it, 1) has he done or said anything to make you not believe or trust him? 2) how long ago was ""a long time ago,"" and do you pick up any weird vibes or tension when they're around each other? 3) did you find literally anything else in his phone to support where your mind has gone concerning the one you did find? If there was something salacious going on between the two of them, surely that wasn't the sole text left in his phone. 

Ask all the questions you need to ask of all the people necessary to give yourself some clarity and peace of mind. But, if you love him and want to make the relationship last, trust literally has to be the foundation and is the bare minimum, imo.

"Yes, I said it is justified at this point. She did what she did. No going back. Yes, infidelity can found by sneaking through a spouses phone but, it's not ok.

It is highly prevalent of the people on Reddit to shift blame, excuse, justify, rationalize, and project through their confirmation bias and trauma.

The point is, OP was wrong in how she handled herself. No matter how she proceeds, it is all bad because of her trust issues and insecurities. No getting around it. How bad would she look if they weren't having sex and she made a whole thing about this? Dumb as bricks. Even if she is ""right,"" she is in bad spot because of how she got the information. She discredited her reliability and sensibility. What if the brother already knows the sil was there?

You don't think the sil and bf can spin the story and win the brother over? Who is the brother going to trust more? An insecure gf digging through her bf's old text messages because of a hunch or his family?

If she asked him to use his phone and saw a message right there, she was looking over his shoulder and saw the message, or an organic way, it'd be alright. She'd be good.

People who can't trust their partner for whatever reason (own trust issues, suspicious behavior, and more) don't need proof or the truth for their sanity.

Do you know the report and tone that your bf uses with his SIL and vice versa?

Before you burn your ships be aware that you are heading into a shitstorm without a map or information other than one single like in an old text and your own insecurities. 

You could be right but there is no way of unopen this can of worms if you go ahead with this based on one line in an old text. 

No matter what you do nothing good will come out of this. If there was something actually incriminating there then both of them have now emptied their phones and accounts. So you will have nothing when you ""reveal"" what you think is their affair. 

In the best of worlds you will look like an insecure and crazy girlfriend. If things go worse BIL and SIL could see their marriage go down in flames, the whole family could be destroyed and violence might ensue...for you only having one line of text to base your accusation upon.

1. Who gives a fuck if she thinks you’re jealous. If she’s fucking her husbands brother, she should be the one embarrassed and even if she isn’t, I’m sure she would get how that message would come across. 2. You should either ignore it, or go to your boyfriends brother and ask his opinion on it and make sure you have screenshots of the messages unless your boyfriend deleted it which makes it even more shady. Second option, I guarantee you’re losing him as a boyfriend regardless if he was sleeping with her. You going to the brother will probably create drama between the 3, and if he’s being honest, he will probably be mad you went behind his back. You could wait until all 3 are present to bring it up and see how they all react. But if you already had distrust for him that even warranted you going through his phone to look for something, it’s not going to go away. It could give you the closure of not knowing forsure though.

And 9 times out of ten if they actually did do something they'll get pissed off and defensive for you even THINKING they would dare cheat on you.

But my original comment is that trust is the cornerstone of a relationship and if the trust is gone and both sides aren’t working to fix it then it is over.

💯if I saw a message like that I would break up with the dude and tell his bro cause at least his bro would have all the information and not be in the dark, whatever that may be.

"I see no difference between parent, partner,  or friend going through my things. It doesn't matter who it is. Don't touch my things without asking. If my bf asks to see my phone, I'll hand it over, no problem. If he touches my phone without permission, I'm going to be very angry. There are reasons we have privacy laws. It's a seriously hard boundary that I won't budge on. You get maybe 2 warnings before I ghost. Or, in the case of my stepmom, I have never invited her back into my space after she chose to violate my privacy. I will meet her on her turf or in public, but not in my home, because I can't trust her.

I've been cheated on, and never once did I go through my ex's phone to confirm it. I picked up on things that didn't add up, and when I'd ask, I'd get gaslighted or it would turn into a fight. An example: I came home one day and noticed all of the things that were obviously mine were conveniently hidden/out of sight (going as far as hiding my hair products under towels), and when I asked about it it turned into a fight about how I'm upset at him for ""cleaning"". So when I stopped trusting him, I ended the relationship.  I don't have time to waste on someone who isn't as invested in a relationship as I am. 

I also have no desire to look at my boyfriend's phone or anything like that. It would've been different if her and her bf had similar looking phones, and she accidentally grabbed his and then saw an inappropriate text by chance. That's an honest mistake that lead into a betrayal discovery. If I suspect something is off, first I'll bring it up as an insecurity or put feelers out (""I noticed you and ______ have been around each other a lot. It's making me feel weird. Can I hang out with you guys, too, so I can be more comfortable with your friendship?"" Type of deal) and then based on the reaction I get, depends on my next step. If it's super defensive and I leave the conversation feeling worse than going in, the next talk I have might involve a breakup. But I don't make those choices when I'm feeling big feelings. I'll sit on it, sort through the information available to me, and then decided what I want, re-address the issue, offer solutions, or establish my boundary and then go from there."

I gave a personal example because of how possessive I am with my privacy and the reasoning behind it. 

 I had an ex go through past messages before to ""see what kind of person [I] am"" and I dumped him on the spot. If you want to see something, ask, and I'll probably show you. But if you can't trust me, and feel the need to snoop, than you're not someone I want in my life. In OPs case, she went through a lot of old messages to find something.

"Dunno about your ending there, if there is a ton of info missing should we be reassuring her, your condoning actions that you have no knowledge of, that doesn’t sit well with me.

Gotta take it on the info provided family members sneak around when planning parties (unlikely given the context here) but stated as they could be an explanation, and remember we only have one sides account and not a particularly full one at that.

"So i have been in a relationship with him for 2 and a half years already. so it's been long enough to be comfortable in knowing each others finances. I love gift giving so throughout our dating I did really give gift for his birthday, anniversary and  some important occasions. so last year to  this year its been hard for both of us, so his birthday is on march and I was September so last year i was planning to resign on feb from my job so i know that march i will not have the budget for his birthday so on january i planned everything and his birthday gifts are ready even if its just January and his birthday is on march. I planned where to go and everything, and his birthday was great he is really thankful cause he knows that I don't have the budget cause i don't have job by that time. time flies and I was helping him to save money for his business i did managed to save some money from him and he trust me to order everything for that business idea he had then he was planning to resign from his job thats why his saving to cover his business idea and so my birth month comes and i know that he doesn't have any money to spend on me cause he used all of it for the business idea he had  but I still expect something like letter or just my favorite candy that doesn't cost that much. my birth month comes and everyday he goes like ""don't expect something cause i really dont have money to buy you any gift"". so I think I was really selfish to expect something from him even though I know that he really don't have money for any gifts at all. so my birthday comes and he didn't come to my house to celebrate cause he doesn't want to go when he doesn't have anything to give. I was very sad that time but i can't really blame him cause i know he doesn't have money. and it will look so bad if im angry because he didn't give me anything so i stayed quiet hehe

Beyond that, there's some element of learning what your partner likes for a birthday. Early in my wife's dating, she and a friend decided to watch a basketball game at our apartment on my birthday. I ended up taking a walk, because I was so frustrated by it, and talked about it later. (I'm not into basketball, so I had no interest in watching it.)

"I \[23M\] dated a girl \[20F\] for a month sometime this year (2-3 months ago) whom I genuinely had a lot of great memories with. It didn’t last, and I realized during this time together that she had some issues with self-esteem and likely BPD.I found out that she has passed away either this weekend or the previous weekend, and if I had to guess, it was self-inflicted.

I want to pay my respects, and at least visit the burial site if there is one.My problem is that the family has never met me before, and I had only swung by 5 or 6 times to their house to pick her up for our dates. Given that her death is very recent, would it be weird / appropriate for me to drive over to their house and leave a note asking them if there were any public memorials or burial locations that I could visit to pay my respects? Is it too soon to ask this from the family? I feel that attending a funeral wouldn’t make sense given how little I knew her, but I would like to at least leave something at her grave.

I think it would be intrusive to show up at their house, when you dated her only very briefly before breaking it off.  They're going through massive grief and it would be a lot to ask them to talk to a stranger or do the homework of responding to a note to give you details.  If you feel you should do something, why not send flowers to her house with a short note explaining that you briefly dated their daughter and had some great memories with her and were very sorry to hear of her tragic passing.	sirslaghter	reply	na	na	na	0.9158532619476318	weak	no	no	na	relationships

Did you meet any of her friends or someone who isn't her immediate family, who you could ask?  It seems like there's got to be a way to get some info without going to her family.

Also, I think how deeply you investigate depends on your reasoning for doing so.  If you're doing this on the principle that outwardly paying your respects is the right thing to do, then maybe just let things be and stay quiet, since you don't know much about the situation and her family's style of grieving.

"Last year, I had a FWB. After 6 months, he moved away but ended up moving back a few months ago. I still haven’t seen him, but we’ve been talking since early July. He's basically a pen pal at this point.

For weeks, the conversation was purely platonic, although he dropped a few hints about being single. I was doubting his interest in me and didn’t want to push it, but then he took it in a more flirty direction. He asked if I’d be interested in reviving the FWB agreement, talking about how hot the sex was. I said yes. A few days later, we had made plans to meet. He ended up bailing, claiming he was too tired. He’d done this in the past last year, so this wasn’t his first offense.

I don’t think he was with anyone else, because we talked for 2 hours at the time we were supposed to meet. I asked if he was even interested in the sexual component of the relationship. He said he was. I then said reliability was important to me, and asked if he was willing to be more dependable. He said no. And, because this may come up in the comments, he also said no to any kind of commitment or relationship beyond FWB. We both walked away from that conversation knowing the “with benefits” part was off the table.

Since then, he’s still been initiating conversation with me on multiple occasions, but it’s back to completely platonic. It’s beyond low effort “wyd” texts. One was a video he recorded while out and about, showing me something he thought I’d like based on stuff we talked about last year. Another was him giving me a quick look at his new gaming computer, something we’re both into. Another was a voice memo. I know these are basically breadcrumbs, but at this point, I don't get the purpose.

What’s the deal? Is this guy lonely? Keeping me in his orbit? Ego? Why turn down no strings sex that he initiated, but then keep talking to me about other stuff?

Tl;dr FWB initiates meetups, then bails. Says he’s still interested but we’ve been talking for 6 weeks now and nothing has happened.

Even in your OP, you state you revoked the 'benefits' which still leaves the 'friends'. If the 'with benefits' part is off the table, is it wrong for him to think the 'friends' bit might not be? 

To me, it seems like he is comfortable with being just friends while you want more.

"I am 25m, never dated anyone, kissed, hook up, etc. Nothing. And honestly, it's been fine for me. I was able to focus on school and hobbies and now have a good career. I'm quite introverted and I will just keep to myself but I still have a few good friends (online) and good relationship with family. I never felt like I needed a girlfriend, and still don't. Life is okay, I can't complain. But as I'm getting older I just can't help wonder if I will regret this lifestyle of just being ""comfortable"". It's also hard to ignore the financial benefits of partnership.

  
It kind of feels like I am missing out on experiences that the vast majority of people value, but also I am just not extremely motivated to put myself out there if that makes sense. Part of it might be that from an outside perspective it just feels so impossibly hard to find a genuine connection these days. I work remotely, my hobbies are very male-oriented, honestly the only times I go out are for sports/gym. So I feel I would need to make major changes to my lifestyle to go out of my way to meet people (I don't think dating apps are for people like me). With so many people these days being shallow, disingenuous, or only interested in hooking up, finding someone genuine where there is mutual attraction seems improbable at best.

Throwaway account for privacy reasons.

My friend and I have known each other for a couple of years now. Once we met we quickly became close, however we lost touch for a few years and just recently reconnected, and it's like we were never apart. During one of our conversations, i admitted that I had a huge crush on her back when we were younger, and she revealed that she had actually been attracted to me as well. The feelings i had felt for her back then had been coming back to the surface, so I took the plunge and told her that my feelings for her hadn't changed since then. She also then said she had feelings for me as well, and we both admitted how much we wanted to kiss the other the last time we met.
 
However, she had just gotten into a relationship, so nothing more could really happen between us. I told her that i didn't want to interfere with her relationship considering she just got into it, and I didn't want to be an asshole, but i have no idea how to deal with this situation. I feel like the tension between us will only start to build, especially since the attraction between us is mutual, but i also can't shake the feeling that this is too good to be true, and i have no intention of being a homewrecker. What do?

Good! You're already doing the correct thing. Like the other commenter said, the ball's already in her court to decide whether to leave the relationship.

For now, consider for yourself whether you'd feel comfortable staying just friends with someone you just talked mutually about kissing with. If you can do that, then express interest in staying friends, without any judgment about her relationship.

If you can't do that, I'd totally and completely understand, as there's certainly potential for awkwardness there.

"Hi im aware this might sound douchey but i need help. So me and my BF have been together for a year. It is a long distance relationship and so far we have met twice. We're planning the 3rd meet up in a few days.

The thing is my BF is pretty cheerful and positive. He has a golden retriever personality. He is a great boyfriend, makes everything fun and tries to keep me included by sending me pics of everything he's doing. However, i think he sends me way too many pictures. Fills me in on way too many details on what he does in a day. So we run out of convo pretty fast because that leaves me with nothing to ask him.

Is it reasonable to ask him to keep a bit of distance? So as to maintain mystery and so i can be the one to reach out first and ask him what he's doing. Having details of EVERYTHING in my inbox is gonna make me slack off my gf duties because hes not making me work for it. And it also makes me lose a bit of interest.

I dont mind him sharing his day with me but i want it sorta to be 30% him sharing, 70% me asking about the details so we can actually make convo.

Is this something i can bring up with my bf? Or is this not normal and im supposed to be excited about everything he shows me? I have noticed the only times im more attracted to him is when he leaves a bit of mystery and is not super clingy.

TLDR; my bf sends me pics of everything he does in a day and it leaves no mystery for us and makes me slack off my gf duties. Am i supposed to be receptive of everything he sends me or can i tell him to keep a little space?"	rileyyy124	post	21.97609282909579	female	White	0.9927916526794434	na	na	na	4	relationships
"Yes, it's 100% reasonable to request a change in communications. Different people have different communication styles and preferences, so if your boyfriend's default patterns for messaging you aren't what you're comfortable with, work with him on it.

When you have the opportunity to sit down and talk to him in person, bring it up. It could look something like:

""Hey, I really appreciate you sharing so much about your life and I absolutely love that you want me to be a part of it, but I'd like to learn about these aspects of your life as part of a conversation, rather than a play-by-play. It would really help me feel more involved as your girlfriend to ask for these kinds of details during an intentional conversation, rather than have everything shared with me throughout the day, by default. I want to hear how you feel about this too, because I respect your feelings and perspective, and I want to work out a pattern for communication that works for both of us.""

"I'm not good with english, sorry in advance. 

So, my bf and I are in a LDR for more than a year now. We've had a rocky relationship bc he cheated on me a year before. I forgave him bc i loved him and he made everything to gain my trust back. 

But there's this girl from his uni that i'm not really comfortable with. This is because he once told me he was going to move in with her as roomates. I got really weirded out bc before that i have never heard of her, i heard of other girls but not her, and i got surprised when he told me that they were together basically all of the time when they were at the uni. We got into a huge fight bc i didnt feel good with that. I told him that bc of his past actions and because i didnt know her at all, and also because i dont want him living with another woman that it's not me, i didnt want him to move in with her or anyone else from the opposite sex. After that, when he mentions her i feel some kind of way even tho there has been only that incident and it wasnt really like he did something with her that i know of. 


So, here I am. I found out yesterdad that she blocked me on instagram. My bf was on my house and was on instagram and I saw her username, that was weird for me bc when i tried to stalk her (yeah, i know :/) months before her page didnt show up in my search. So i thought that she didnt have instagram anymore, but now it seems that it was because she blocked me and I dont know why. I felt weird about her only because of that incident about being possible roomates but we've never had a proper interaction and we've only seen each other once and we only said hi. So i dont know why she did that. 

I dont know if im overthinking rn bc of my bf past mistakes or if this is really sus. I dont know what to do, if i talk to my bf what should i ask? Or what should i say? And what if he says that he doesnt know the reason? And what could be a possible solution? I dont want to break up, so im thinking of telling him to stop contacting her but idk if that's the right thing bc they picked the same classes on uni so they will be basically together all the time during this semester. 

Please, someone wiser than me help me.

"I’ll try to make this short. Found out a year ago my gf had hookup with a guy named Bob in the past and didn’t tell me until much later. I let it go because i knew nothing happened between them while we were together since she was literally with me almost 24/7 and we lived together.

But recently i remember an instance where me and my gf were at a club standing at the bar together waiting to order drinks. We all knew each other and I knew bob at the time, but bob only went up to my gf and said something to her. Right after he said something to her she smiled and grabbed me, tried to stick her tongue in my mouth, and i stopped her and said what’s up? why you do that? It was awkward.

He was literally standing right infront of us while she did that. He laughed and went away.

She said oh i just wanted to kiss you. She usually shows affection and all but it was so odd. As soon as he said something to her, she grabbed me and try to makeout while he’s standing right there. Now i am wondering what was said to cause her to do that.

It’s been wayy over a year since this happened but it’s in my head. I now mentioned to my gf which is sort of too late i know. She doesn’t know what was said and she says oh i always kiss you. That situation is in my head because i remember how odd it was. We are sort of fighting about it. and i feel like i may be in the wrong. Maybe i am thinking too much into it

TL;DR: There’s a guy name bob who my gf hookup with and didn’t mention to me until a year ago.I remember a instance from almost 2 years ago at the club where bob went up to gf and said something to her. Which made my gf grab me and try to makeout with me while he’s standing right there. It was really odd and awkward. Asked her what’s up right after. Bob laughed and left.

"As the title says, my boyfriend of 8 months hasn’t said “I love you” yet. I’m probably just overthinking, but I wanted to get others opinions.

I said I love you around the 4 month mark. It wasn’t intentional, it just kind of slipped out when we were joking around with each other. I was actually a little sad because I knew he wasn’t ready, and I wanted to wait until I thought he was, or until he said it.

It’s been a few months since then, and I say it about once a week. We’ve talked about that and he’s told me that it doesn’t make him uncomfortable, just shy, but that he likes it. 

He’s had a couple other relationships before me, though never for over a year, and he’s said I love you in at least one of those. I’ve been in 3 long term relationships (over a year) and it never took this long. 

We had a conversation about it a few weeks ago, and I asked him why he hasn’t said it yet. He told me it’s because he doesn’t feel it yet. I figured that was the reasoning, but it still hurt to hear. I wonder if there’s something I’m doing wrong, or if he has needs that aren’t being met.

I’m patient, and I can continue to be patient. I care about him very much, and this is the best relationship I’ve ever been in. He does make me feel loved in other ways, and our sex is amazing. We have a lot in common, he makes time for me, he’s kind, funny, and very affectionate, both physically and verbally.

I guess I’m just worried that we’ll hit the one year mark and he still won’t have said it. Those words are important to me. Like I said, I’m probably just overthinking a lot, but I wanted to hear from others and hopefully some people who have been/are in the same boat. 

Thank you for listening and for any feedback you might have!

"You're not doing anything wrong. Being in love with someone (infatuation) and loving someone are 2 completely different things.

I (26M) never crushed on my (now) ex gf of 3+ years, we just got along very well and I appreciated her a lot. Only after 1 year, I truly felt those ""deep down love emotions"" for the first time, i basically skipped the honeymoon crush phase.

\-> rational people like me are able to notice the difference. It doesn't mean we shouldn't use a silly white lie to not upset you. It's a process he'll have to learn.

You're young, he's young, we make silly mistakes by wanting to be 100% honest with each other and not saying those things because technically he doesn't love you yet. It doesn't mean anything to him and he knows he will love you for sure, he just doesn't want to ""lie"". He probably isn't even aware what damage he caused you.

There’s nothing wrong with you being “in love” first just as, in my opinion, there’s nothing wrong with him not being there yet. Too often couples say they love each other early on in the relationship because they feel it’s the right thing to do. The reality of the situation is that 99% of people who say that nowadays don’t actually mean it. It’s the socially/romantically acceptable thing to say but love goes way beyond the way people mean it nowadays. Maybe he’s waiting until he knows he means it means it. I mean would you rather him say it to please you when it’s not how he really feels? True love takes longer than a year to form and anyone that says otherwise is crazy imo. With that being said, the question you should be asking is if there’s a future with you in his eyes.

"Growing up I loved celebrating my birthdays. It was always a big deal to me and for the past two years with my boyfriend I’ve felt sad and depressed sometimes. He took me to Ulta on one of my birthdays to buy things by myself well he waited in the car. This was for my 22nd birthday later that day I cried cause I wanted to go eat dinner with him and I cried off all my makeup and we went to a drive threw. On my 23rd birthday I cried all day because I felt like he didn’t plan anything for my birthday. Then his sister ordered things for me for my birthday, so we just had snacks and watched tv for the rest of the night. Today is my 24th birthday and I don’t want a repeat of the last two years. He told me he didn’t want to make a big deal about my birthday a couple days ago and that I should just grow up. 

I then told him that I just wanted to spend time with him on my birthday and this morning he said he was going to make me pancakes and he got upset with me over something stupid and said I give him headaches and then he said he wasn’t going to cook right now so of course I got upset and I told him it was my birthday and he seemed to not care. I just feel sad. I know I’m going to celebrate with friends later this week but I just feel like I wanted to make up for the last two years where I had a shitty birthday. 

Not once has this man bought me flowers or surprised me and when he did it’s because I basically had to beg and I felt like it wasn’t the same when he did get me the flowers and we’ve been together for three years and have lived together our whole relationship. Yesterday we were talking about having kids like we use to and then out of know where he tells me he wants to start when he’s 26, which means I’ll be 27. He never told me that before so this was news to me. Our first plan was to wait until I’m 25. Which would be next year. But now that’s out of plan? 

I told him that I don’t want to wait until I’m in my late 20s or 30s to start a family. I told him that I want to be young when we start and he told me that he wants us to be ready and be successful when starting a family which I completely understand but then I told him what if that doesn’t happen for a couple more years? I just feel like the time for having kids will keep pro longing. Like will we really know when it’s the right time? I just feel sad that we’re not on the same page about having kids now.




Edit: For years he tried to change me and I admit I use to have bad habits because of how I grew up. But I don’t want to become this boring person who doesn’t really celebrate anything. Over the last two years I’ve noticed that he doesn’t like family gatherings and says he wants to work on himself first before attending family gatherings. Etc. 

He’s told me not to give him advise before and that I can’t just listen to him and then he’s told me to focus on my own goals and he will focus on his but sometimes I do feel like we’re on different timelines. When we use to argue a lot he would tell me we’re not compatible but now I can see that and I thought we could fix things and learn to be compatible. I do love him and that’s why I’ve stayed because we do have really good days but then I think about what he said to me last night about our future. 






TL;DR my boyfriend doesn’t like to celebrate any birthdays or holidays and doesn’t think it’s really a big deal. Also to my surprise he changed the time line for us having kids knowing that as we age it will be harder to have kids if we wait until our mid 30s when he knows I wanted us to have a big family in the future."

"For both the birthday situation and the kids situation, you two REALLY need to get on the same page about your expectations.

I'm surprised you two have gone one for the last two years, with you thinking that he's going to give you exactly the birthday experience you want, and him thinking that everything's fine in your relationship if he just ignores it like it's any other day. **TALK ABOUT IT, DAMMIT**. If you two can't reconcile your expectations, then you two are going to continue having this problem for however long your relationship lasts!

Same goes with having kids, except the stakes are higher. If you don't feel confident about your boyfriend committing to your timeline for starting a family, **tell him so**! Consider for yourself what it'd take for you to feel confident that he takes your timeline seriously and will commit to whatever steps are necessary to make raising a family happen by the time your deadline rolls around. Then communicate those expectations to him, and see if he can assure you that he'll actually commit.

Unlike the birthday situation, though, expectations about raising a family are a very serious commitment that there's no easy compromise for, so if you two can't meet eye-to-eye on this, then you two may need to seriously consider separating for a partner who's more aligned with your baby expectations."

Maybe when the time is right, say some thing along the line of ""Babe, you have some body odor lingering and this isn't the first time. You need to step up and shower a little more often, especially now when we are in a heat wave or I find it hard to be around you"".

You might even join him in the shower as an incentive. I'd at least convince him to shower close to daily or tell him sex will only be on shower days, and that's if you are in the mood that day.

"My boyfriend and I met more than two years ago. It was a bit complicated from the beginning, as a great insecurity on my part clashed with his inability to talk about/show his feelings. As a result, our relationship developed very slowly and there were frequent arguments. On top of that, after a few months of being in a relationship, he went on a semester abroad. At that point,
although we were sure we wanted to hold on to a committed relationship, the words ""I love you"" never came up.

After he came back a lot of things improved. We communicated better, fought less, and I felt more secure in the relationship because I saw that he was working on a lot of things that were important to me in the relationship. But the downer is: he
still hasn't told me he loves me. All I get is a ""hab dich lieb"" - which in German is sort a toned down form of ""i love you"".

To be clear, I haven't said it yet either, but it's actually clear because I've taken all the ""first steps"", show him my feelings regularly, and keep signaling that I desperately want him to say those words. He has never expressed to me the thought of wanting to break up, is faithful and physically loving to me. Nevertheless, I miss that he also articulates feelings. Am I naive for still being with him?

There are ways you could rationalize this, but at the end of the day, he struggles to express his feelings and you've been in a committed relationship for 2 years- by this point, he should know if he loves you, and if he does, he should have said it by now.

If you're on the same page and want to use it more, then mission accomplished!

"So I went to this club and I was dancing by myself for most of the night. I saw this one woman sitting down with two of her friends and I asked her if she’d like to dance. She got up and she said “you’re asking me if I want to dance?” And I was like “yeah.” And she was like I don’t know but she got up and her and her friends started dancing. I was dancing with them in their circle. I then touched that woman’s hand and I was like “let’s dance.” And she was like “i’m not sure.” So I moved away from them and went about my business dancing again. 

Some time later one of her friends walked up to me and started motioning me to leave. She was like “go away.” And I was just looking at her cause I was like I’m not even dancing with y’all anymore. I was still near them so to speak but I wasn’t even facing them. 

She then started talking with another of her friends and I think she said something about me being a creep but I couldn’t really hear cause the music was so loud. That kinda bothered me because I don’t feel like I was that persistent and I left them alone. Am I missing something?

It also sounds like you were hovering way too close if one of them was motioning for you to move away. I would have been uncomfortable and creeped out as well. 

Protip: sometimes women are afraid to outright reject men or say no.  Sometimes men get VERY aggressive when told no. It's happened to me. Her saying 'I don't know' and 'I'm not sure' was her turning you down. Them getting up to go dance all together was them trying to leave the situation.

Sounds like you took an ambiguous situation and assumed it was an affirmative response to your request, when in the end, they were more clear about not being interested.

You may just need to set a higher threshold for interpreting people's responses. ""I don't know"" isn't exactly a clear affirmation, and dancing with their friends in a way that doesn't acknowledge you isn't exactly a clear invitation for you to join them. So I think you need to adjust your expectations for what qualifies as an affirmative response. Does she need to have some word of affirmation in her response, like Yes, Sure, or Why Not? Does she need to have more friendly or accommodating body language, like a smile with direct eye contact, or facing her body more towards you? These are much stronger indications of interest and consent than what you described to us, and waiting for these sorts of indications, rather than making assumptions from ambiguous situations, will get you into a lot less trouble.

I haven’t broken up yet for personal safety reasons until I can move out because even though he’s never been dangerous you just never know.  I’m looking forward to starting fresh and working on myself. 

Well, i found some of his bank statements on my computer and actually discovered that a month ago he took out $180 from an atm. The atm is located at one of those seedy places where girls dance for money but aren’t actually professional dancers. The girls there have surgeries etc… I asked him about it. He said he was curious to go because it used to be a different type of place before but that he went in and left. That was also a night we had an argument. That night we actually slept together. The transaction happened after midnight but he had already been with me around 1am when he got home. The next morning he gifted me $100. He says he never cheated and that he was just mad at me but went straight home. That he didn’t like the place and that he went in and out. Should I believe this? It doesn’t matter anymore because like I said, I’m actually moving out but this will give me more peace and more strength to focus on Just me.

Tl;dr boyfriend who made jokes about my weight went to a seedy lounge where beautiful girls with surgeries dance with men for money

Old post for reference pasted below: 

My boyfriend (36M) called me (30sF) a h*rny cow today

I’ve struggled with body image and gained about 30 pounds due to health issues, including surgeries and needing physical therapy. My boyfriend is well aware of this. A few weeks ago while drunk, he called me “fat” “ugly” and “overweight” but said he didn’t mean that he was just drunk. Today we were driving and he passed by a gym and told me he was gonna drop me off there. He said he was kidding. Then I said I wanted to have a “quickie” on our stop home before heading to the lake. He called me a h*rny cow. I now feel so self conscious. He’s been grabbing and kissing me since saying he thinks I’m beautiful and perfect. However now I feel the opposite. He has a history of following skinny girls with surgeries on social media and stopped doing it a year ago when I told him it bothered me. However, I am already aware of his type. How do I go about this in a calm and respectful way?

Tl;dr boyfriend jokingly makes comments about my weight and I feel bad about myself

Also if anyone is curious, I actually just weighed myself. I am in the low 170s and i am 5’5

Thank you all for all of your kid words. I’ve been doing some inner work and it’s because of years of bullying by family and by friends that I allowed this and think I have to tolerate it. Growing up with no family has made me think that I have to put up with this type of behavior because they’re “close to me”. My ex husband yelled at me, my mom physically abused me, some date R^* in the past, and just overall a mix of bad experiences.

"There's many reasons why I think this and I'm coming to accept it now, I just need to vent.
Firstly my (25m) boyfriend has cheated on me (25f) in the past, which obviously has made me believe that he never liked me or felt any attraction to me at all. This was a while ago and I thought I was over it, turns out I'm not. He also can't stop looking at naked women online. He told me he watched porn at the start of our relationship, and while I tried to be a 'cool' girlfriend and say I didn't mind, the thought of him pleasuring himself to a woman that isn't me just makes me feel sick. He also saves pictures of naked women. He never asks for naked pictures of me and doesn't have any pictures of me, that I know of, on his phone as he never wants to take pictures of me. 

We had a discussion recently and I told him that I feel so bad about how I look and who I am, and that I don't want to feel disgusting anymore. It ended with him promising that he'd stop, but he  hasn't.
It hurts because I really thought our relationship was better this time. He's been more loving and I've been trying to be better for him. I've told him that I'll do anything to try and help him feel more attracted to me, I'll try new things in bed that he wants to do rather than watch another woman do it, and I'll try to look better, but he says there's nothing. I just don't believe it anymore and it hurts so much.

I accepted a while ago that I'm not as attractive as I'd like to be, I'm a plain looking person and I know there's nothing I can do to change it. I can just try to accept it. I'm certainly not as attractive as the women he looks at, but I'm trying to take better care of myself so that I look better to him. It's just hard because I work long hours and I'm tired a lot. I already took good care of myself, I just stopped wearing makeup a while ago because I'm usually not motivated to. 

He doesn't show any passion towards me and he doesn't initiate sex very often at all so all of these things makes me believe that he's just not attracted to me anymore. I don't know if he ever was. 
I can't keep feeling this awful about myself. I just don't know what is still wrong with me, and I can't understand why I've never been good enough to just have someone only want me and not want to look anywhere else. 
I know some will say it may be his libido being low, and while I've thought about it and would be completely understanding if it was, I just can't believe that it is. Maybe it's me being naive as I have a high sex drive and love giving and receiving physical affection, but why would he still be looking at other women in a sexual way online if his libido was low? 

I've blamed myself for all this time, and pleaded with him so much to try and change things for our relationship, but I'm getting tired of trying because he'll never find me attractive anyway.

"Using porn, making porn, or cheating doesn't really mean something specific about how attractive you might be.

You don't really need to dive into how attractive he might find you or the porn issue if cheating is a deal breaker. It typically is for people.

Some women have a boundary about porn and consider it cheating. Some have a ""don't ask don't tell"" policy. Some watch it too. I will say it is a very different thing than sex. There isn't pressure and the dude might have kinks he doesn't want to share. He could very well have enough energy for that but not with a partner. It could also be the case he does that too much and could do more with you if he cut back.

He could also do other things to make you feel special. You could also consider what things you could work on if it's an insecurity in addition to his shitty behavior. Again cheating is often a deal breaker."	AstronautLost8222	reply	na	na	na	0.998865008354187	no	no	no	na	relationships

"I  (21M) have never been in a relationship my entire life. Throughout my life, I've seen all kinds of love that people give and receive. I know I might be too young and immature to say this, but in my personal opinion, I think not all people really deserve love, and I just happen to be one of them. I never experienced having a crush on someone until I came across this one girl (23F). She's older than me, already has a good career, an amazing personality, and is as beautiful as the way she is. She is the embodiment of beauty in my dictionary. Never in my life did I ever think I would be so deeply in love with someone like her, someone I know damn well I would never have a chance with. Ever since I developed a crush on her, my interest in other girls just does not exist anymore, no matter how good and beautiful they are. And then there's me, just a regular guy. I look younger for my age, don't have a career yet (still studying), look alright, and am just trying to survive. I would say I'm a pretty confident guy in general, but I'm too scared to even make a move on her. Every time I imagine all the romantic life I want to have with her, the thought that she could be with someone better than me—better looking, funnier, taller, or perhaps richer—just destroys everything. I think for the person I am right now, I don't deserve her at all. Maybe her existence in my life is not meant for me to love her, but rather to learn how to love. The lack of confidence to be in a relationship just gets to me every time. I'm too scared that my partner may not get what they want and be satisfied with me. Because of that, I don't think I deserve the love that I want, the love that I'm seeking. Sometimes I wonder if there's someone who shares the same experience as I do.

Dude, everyone has their first relationship at SOME point. We've all been there, even the people in long-term relationships.

Yes, you'll absolutely make mistakes in your first relationship, just like how you've made mistakes at your first job, or mistakes in a class you've just started, or mistakes at your first attempt doing ANYTHING you're unfamiliar with. **We all make mistakes at shit we start off doing**.

The key is being able to accept the possibility that you'll screw up, and recognize that it's normal and nothing to be ashamed of.

"PSA for thread readers: This is a problematic assumption. Escorts tend to get tested monthly, but many STDs don't show up on a convenient monthly schedule. Best testing recommendations are \~1week after exposure for many STDs (gonnorhea, etc), but weeks to months for HIV, syphallis, Hep B, etc. So an escort may test negative and may appear asymptomatic, but can still pass along some infections. Add to that that many escorts use condoms for PIV sex, but give BJs bare, and that some infections can pass through skin and saliva contact that's not covered by condoms...

Escorts also typically do a visual inspection of clients, but many if not most clients are never STD tested. Many client screening systems just ask if someone has an STD, and never ask for test results. So an escort may see dozens of men in a short period of time with a fairly unhelpful STD screening for herself, and is exposed to anything those clients are carrying in the meantime.

My partner saw dozens of high end NYC escorts over the past few years, both independent and through established agencies, and never once got an STD test.

Just a note on the math-- an escort seeing 1-2 people a day can still have sex with 7-14 people in a week, or dozens in a month. That many partners can render a monthly STD test pretty useless, particularly if her clients are also seeing other sex workers.

"Me (23 year old male) am jealous of my girlfriend's (23 year old female) co-worker who is quite younger than us (19 years old), we have been dating for about 2 years now.

 It all started when my girlfriend started this summer job, we live about 2 hour drive away so I go visit her as much as I can, the first time I visited her this summer she told me this co-worker is hitting on her, I immediately felt jealous but tried not to show it, although I appreciated that she told me.

Fast forward I go visit her again about 2 weeks later and I asked about the co-worker and she suddenly changed the story that she misinterpreted his signals and that he acts in a flirty manner with everyone. Then she tells me that they have become good friends, he told her that she's like a sister for him, they also went out a couple of times with other common friends they have. I started getting really jealous of this point, I have always suffered from extreme jealousy in relationships, it starts to become an obsessive thought and I can't think of anything else, it really is a painful feeling the thought of my girlfriend having sex of even liking someone else, I constantly have nightmares about it, I guess it kind of stems from my insecurity or something. Despite this I tried no signs of me being jealous whatsoever and kept it cool, despite the raging fire in my brain, I tried to stay at her place as long as possible worried that if I leave that she might cheat on me, eventually I tried to look at it from a logical perspective and told myself I can't stay there the whole summer waiting for her at home while she's out working.

Visit her again about a week later, she keeps on talking to me about him which drives me crazy, if I did the same thing to her talking about a female friend I'm 100% sure she would be jealous, I mean am I overreacting? She also told me he makes her laugh by doing this impression, Ive also met this dude in person, and I know this might sound very insecure but he is much better looking than me and real tall, he barely acknowledged me when me met and seemed kind to give me kind of a bad stare, especially when she kissed me.

Now she's been telling me that he always talks about this other chick whom he his hitting on, but she doesn't seem to be interested. This should put my mind at ease right? My girlfriend sent me an audio message last night telling me that they met at this local party and he was with this chick and that he completely ignored her. She sounded real pissed, almost jealous, she went on ranting that he's been wasting time with this girl, and that she doesn't like him. Ive been feeling really paranoid as of lately, it seems that she likes him and vice-versa, the night he ignored her with this other girl was the same day he saw us kissing, I'm wondering if its a retaliation of some kind. This situation is bringing out the worst thoughts in me, why does she keep on talking to me about him? I would honestly have honesty preferred not to know, I'm really at a lost on what I should do, this whole ordeal has been torturing me mentally and I really want to say something, but at the same time I don't want to show I'm jealous. I just feel like just asking her plain and clear if she likes him or not, and how this whole situation is making me feel. I feel that if I show any sign of anger or jealousy she will think less of me, and me not being there is just making everything a whole lot worse not knowing what she is up to. I've honestly considered breaking up with her, I'm just not cut out for relationships, thoughts jealousy really makes me feel agitated and sick to my stomach, can't even sleep right at night anymore , It would spare me a great deal of mental anguish. What should I do? I'm really at a lost here.

&#x200B;

TL;DR My girlfriend has become good friends with her co-worker, always talks to me about him and seems to like him. I am extremely jealous, have not yet confronted her about my jealousy, and not sure how to handle this whole situation, some advice would be helpful."

"Any sort of distance relationship is tough, I’ve been there. It’s important to realize the difference between jealousy and insecurities/trust. It is very normal to be jealous of anyone that gets to spend more time with your significant other than you do. Distrust comes from signs you have seen from them giving you a reason not to trust them, this also happens all the time but much more difficult to recover from.

Good distance relationships are built on good communication and trust, it’s important to voice your feelings of jealousy with your partner. Be very careful not to let these feelings of jealousy show that you do not trust them. If they are an empathetic person they should see that the amount they talk about this person and the amount of time they spend with them is causing you to have these feelings of jealousy but only after you have expressed these feelings.

Don’t take one person’s opinion on the internet to heart. Seek out a relationships expert and/or a therapist."	BongWatcher	reply	na	na	na	0.9899571537971497	weak	strong	no	na	relationships

I am a 31 yr old pregnant woman and my boyfriend of 5 years is texting a 20 yr old female intern from his job.

I definitely have attachment issues and have been jealous in the past if he wanted to hang out with other people and I know that it was wrong. But this time it just really doesn't sit right with me that he's started a friendship with a girl who is so young and pretty. Also, she no longer works at his job but he is continuing to text her almost everyday. 

 He says they are just friends and even though she's attractive he's not attracted to her. He says he enjoys talking to younger people because they're not jaded and she happens to be really funny and interesting to talk to. From the chats I've read there isn't any flirting... yet. Lots of sending memes and tik toks and joking around.

I really messed up by going through his phone multiple times and invading his privacy... but I don't see how I can get over him talking to her. Now he's completely locked up everything and changed passwords and I can't stop obsessing over what they are talking about and where this is going. Why in the world does a 33 yr old man have any business talking to a 20 yr old... I just feel it's obvious he likes the attention and he must want to sleep with her even if he doesn't think it will actually go there. Idk what good can come out of this type of ""friendship"". And the fact that I told him right off the bat that it made me uncomfortable and insecure in our relationship but he continues to talk to her.

On one hand I think I'm overreacting but then I can't stop obsessing and feel like he should drop this girl because I am more important. My pregnancy hormones are driving me crazy and I just feel so sad and disrespected. I know I'm pushing him away and annoying him everytime I bring it up or end up crying but I feel like he just doesn't get it.

Can a man in a relationship really have a friendship with a woman he finds attractive? She seems to understand his humor more than me and also shares interests like video games that I'm not into... am I crazy for feeling so insecure? Do I just suck it up and try to earn back his trust and try to trust that they are only friends?

Tl;dr 
My bf is texting a girl 13 years younger than him that he previously worked with.. and claims they are just friends. I messed up and went through his phone and ruined his trust. He is continuing to text her daily. I do not see the point in an older man wanting a friendship with a young pretty girl unless he wants to sleep with her. I don't know how to trust that it will stay platonic... and can't help but think he is comparing me to her"	mustardrobe	post	27.015708899591058	female	White	0.99835205078125	na	na	na	19	relationships

"Age gaps in friendships *are* fine in and of themselves, and even between two hetero people of differing genders, but in this case I think you're within your rights to ask him not to be so close with her. I don't want to assume motive, but it seems like while he's not actively flirting with this girl, he's entertaining the possibility by building the ""friendship"", and there is a real possibility that it could lead to one or both of them catching feelings. 

He may not be actively building a romantic relationship, but he's certainly laying groundwork, either intentionally or otherwise, to the point where if something *were* to happen, he might even believe that it had occurred naturally, and not because he kept enabling the conditions for things to progress.

If this was a new relationship, it's almost a test; if something did happen, it would be a sign that you weren't right for each other, but right now you have a kid on the way and you both need to be as secure as possible, so he needs to stop fucking around and grow up. (All this said, I don't know the guy, maybe he's telling the complete truth and feels no attraction for her whatsoever. But at his age he should be well aware of the subtext when messaging so much. He needs to be honest with you and with himself. Maybe he just likes the attention, but either way it's not fair to you and your partnership now that you've made your feelings clear.

If you met a young guy and you got on well, and it was purely platonic for you, would you be willing to end the friendship if it made your partner upset? Yes, right? Or would you think it controlling/toxic and stay friends with the guy your partner is jealous of?

Of course we shouldn't judge others entirely by our own standards, but if this is your long-term partner with whom you're having a baby, you are certainly within your rights to ask that he respect your wishes and not do something that makes you so uncomfortable. And if he thinks that you are being toxic and controlling, then that doesn't change that you still have boundaries and one of them is not having to worry about your partner putting themselves in the firing line of temptation.

Of course you can't ask him to have no friends, but I think it would be fair to ask that he stop talking with this attractive young woman who he almost certainly would pursue if he were single because you're both in a stressful time of your life and it's about to get more stressful, and he needs to buck up and make the sacrifice of not having the attention of an attractive younger woman when he needs to be present for you as a partner and father.

If possible, a licensed couples therapist would be ideal to solve this in a way that causes the least amount of stress. It'll be hard to talk about it without getting upset or accusatory, and that won't help much at all.

I hope I'm not moralising too much or overestimating the importance of a stable household when raising children (I've never done it myself) but to me it seems like even if he's not cheating emotionally, the stress it's causing you is enough to justify ending the friendship.

The fact that he's changed his passwords isn't a red flag in and of itself. People in relationships are still entitled to privacy.

"Title: Is my boyfriend an asshole or am I overly sensitive? Need advice on a recent incident.

Hey everyone, I'm feeling a bit confused and would appreciate some perspective on a situation that happened recently with me (29) and my boyfriend (29). We were getting ready for his family's function and we were late already. He was ready and dressed before me.

He was standing in the next room over watching a funny video and as I approached him, he quickly turned it away from me and told me to get dressed. I told him that was rude and he just walked into the next room.

But that wasn't the big issue. A little while later I asked him to help pick an outfit and choose between two options. To my surprise, he flat out refused and said no. With the previous situation and now this I found his behavior extremely rude, especially considering we were going to a family event together where I wanted to look nice.

I explained to him how much of an asshole he was being and he brought up past instances where I asked him to pick an outfit for me and I apparently never chose the option he suggested. He claimed that in the past six months, every time he tried to help, I disregarded his choices. While I admit that I haven't always chosen his suggestions, I genuinely never did it on purpose. He says he isn’t upset i don’t pick his choices, he thinks it’s pointless and refuses.

This is just a single occurrence in a series of events where I believe he could improve as both a partner and a friend. Generally, I find it challenging to discuss issues with him as he tends to avoid acknowledging them. For example, when I confronted him about his behavior and called him an asshole, he disagreed and provided excuses. He claimed that he didn’t want to pick my outfit because it was pointless, and questioned why i wouldn’t consider his feelings about why he wouldn’t pick my outfit, rather than the initial issue about him being rude. I feel in several instances he never considers how I feel, but instead make excuse.

Now, I'm left wondering if my boyfriend is being an asshole in this situation or if I'm just being overly sensitive. Am I overreacting? Does he have a valid reason for his behavior? I'd really appreciate your input and advice on how to address this issue with him.

TL;DR: Boyfriend turned away his phone, told me to get dressed, and refused to help pick an outfit. Cited past instances where I didn't choose his suggestions. I find his behavior rude, but he avoids acknowledging the issue. Wondering if I'm overreacting and need advice on addressing it."

For the video thing, I would say it would be frustrating as hell to be already late and see that you've stopped getting ready in order to stand there watching a video. As for the outfit thing.. you admitted you've not even worn any of the outfits you've asked him to choose from. I would have also found it pointless to entertain that again.

 And a tip: If a man's avoiding talking to you about issues *at all* it's because he no longer sees a point in the conversation. He's not going to get any traction, he's not going to be heard, he's just being talked at...so he'll refuse to engage because what's the point?

After I was dressed I asked him what he thought about my outfit and another. He responded “no, I’m not doing this with you” I’m confused at this point and feels he’s being rude. If picking out my outfit is pointless and you not doing it is the conclusion because it’s such a headache for you that’s fine. But I feel he put his problem over my problem, all I wanted was for him to stop being rude. Is that me not having respect for someone’s time?

">You're still late, and now it's a ""little while later"". Great time to put the mental load of dressing yourself onto your partner.

Right?!  OP (when they inevitably show up late) wants to be able to tell the group ""they were running late getting ready/picking out what to wear"" instead of OP not even having picked out what to wear by the time they were already late.

Then she can start a fight and blame boyfriend for being an asshole as to the real reason they were late.  ""If only you had just helped me choose an outfit we wouldn't be late"".  

OP just didn't care about punctuality for boyfriend's family function.  There's not much more to it.  OP's the asshole.  Which unsurprisingly wasn't one of the options she gave us to choose from."	DrummerStatus3368	reply	na	na	na	0.9989688396453857	weak	no	no	na	relationships

"You have a very strange perspective on this whole situation. If the roles were reversed, you were ready to go, let's say to something really important to yourself , like going to a family function is clearly important to your partner, and your partner took their sweet ass time getting ready and then tried to turn it into argument.  It sounds like he was trying not to be aggressive with you during a situation that was a lose-lose for him. He just wanted to get going to his ""important"" function.

> he quickly turned it away from me and told me to get dressed. I told him that was rude and he just walked into the next room.

For him, stonewalling and then commanding someone to do something is not great. For you, don't assign names or insults. Yes he may have been rude, but you two are partners. Use ""I feel statements"". For example: ""I will get ready, but I feel dismissed when you turned away. Can we have a hug?""

> A little while later I asked him to help pick an outfit and choose between two options. To my surprise, he flat out refused and said no.

For him, he could have explained why and have been more loving. For you, you can't always expect someone will do what you want. I probably would have shrugged and moved on.

> I explained to him how much of an asshole he was being and he brought up past instances where I asked him to pick an outfit for me and I apparently never chose the option he suggested.

No, never call your partner an asshole. As for him, what he said next shows he was being a tad passive agressive. Instead of saying ""honey, I'd like to choose one, but I feel like you always choose the opposite one."" And you can say ""Im sorry, I assure you it's a coincidence. I guess hearing your opinion helps because it gives me an idea of which one I feel strongly for.""

> where I believe he could improve as both a partner and a friend.

This statement sounds weird. You two are a team. It's not you against him. You could also improve.

> For example, when I confronted him about his behavior and called him an asshole, he disagreed and provided excuses

It's normal to defend onself when being insulted. I don't think those are excuses, he just didn't communicate with you and chose the easy way out by not choosing next time.

> I feel in several instances he never considers how I feel

"For 6 years i’ve been blinded despite all the red flags and how shitty he was and yet now that we’ve broken up, i feel sad and empty, there’s a hollow feeling in my stomach that i can’t explain and know how to get rid of.

Quick story of some of the few things that I endured during our relationship.

* For every occasion, like birthdays, valentines and christmas holidays we would fight and he wouldn’t apologize so we stay no contact till the event passes so he doesn’t have to spend money/time or isn’t obliged to give gifts/make efforts. Would complain that he’s always broke when we never go out on dates and would usually split the bills whenever we do. Once he even told me to stop giving him gifts on his birthday just to justify him not preparing anything when it comes to mine. I’m not competing because I genuinely want to make him happy on these special days.
* His whole family is toxic, unsupportive of him and religious hypocrites so I cut contact with them prior the breakup. His mom is rude to me as well. She apologized but I never spoke to any of them again.
* In the beginning of our relationship whenever we fight I would always catch him texting other girls and deleting their conversations even though the conversations were harmless, again why.
* I always have to understand that he doesn’t have time to go on dates starting college and even until he got his first job. He tries to set these but never goes anyway because no time and broke, well maybe i’m the least of his priorities. He would only see me when I’m in his city for work.
* Borrows money from me and haven’t paid it even after so many years.
* Doesn’t bother to fix any of our problems when we fight and would be okay even if we go no contact for months because he knows i’d be back anyways (this is my fault i know). Not to mention all the sleepless nights I spent crying and begging. and so on.

I want to take this love and just turn it to hate I’m so angry, i wish I wasn’t so forgiving and weak. I know I don’t deserve any of the things he did to me but i keep blaming myself. 

I couldn’t tell these things to anyone close to me because they’d be shocked how stupid I am for staying with this man. 

How do i move past all of this and fully heal?

"So I was just bored and downloaded tinder because why not and I was matching with a ton of people and goofing around responding to them in cringe ways. But this guy really caught my eye so I added him on snap. He’s a super dry texter but over the phone(he ask to call a lot) hes good. I unadded him on snap cuz I thought he wasn’t interested, he was texting like “haha, ohh, okay”, one word responses so I was just done. But I forgot to block his number so he text me asking why I unadded him and asking for another shot. So we been talking for like two weeks now he had asked me to come over. But he lives an hour away. And he was saying I can stay over but I really didn’t wanna drive an hour at like 12 am so I said I can today after work. Then he started not being dry, really hyping up his openess with what he does in bed. And I ask what his body count is (its 12). And thats super high! Mines only 3. But anyways yah I texted him last, fell asleep after not getting a response after an hour, I wake up today and Im left on opened which he never does. Should I just unadd him and block his number or should I text him seeing if he still wants to hang out? Cuz to be honest I’m not down bad, and in my head if a guy leaves me on opened he ain’t interested. Or maybe should I wait for him to text me? Help😭

"My partner and I are both in our early 20s and have been in a relationship for almost 3 years. It’s something that we’ve been discussing for a while now, and now that we’re both moving to a new city it seems like the right time. We know we are relatively young - I’m not saying that we know everything. He and I feel excited for the prospect while also ready to deal with whatever outcomes moving in together will create for our relationship. However, the biggest hurdle is my parents. They are Filipino, devout Catholics, and are vehemently against the idea of us moving in together before marriage. They know that we already stay over at each others places/share a bed - this is something they don’t love but can tolerate as long as it happens at a distance. Moving in together is crossing a line for them. A couple months ago, I broached the topic with them and it did not go over well at all. They told me I was selfish, that I hurt them, that I don’t respect them, am rejecting the morals they taught me… you get the gist. While I was not expecting them to be celebrating this news, the level of anger and hurt they expressed really affected me, left me feeling abandoned and unsupported. While they aren’t threatening to cut ties with me, they are constantly telling me that I am being hurtful, or comparing me to themselves (that they would never do anything to disrespect their parents, that they made life choices as dutiful children etc).

In follow up conversations, I have tried to make space for reconciliation, told them I respect their values and that the way they brought us up is still valuable to me. I don’t expect them to get over it overnight but I don’t get any sense that they are willing to accept my decision, and it seems like they’ll be holding it against me and guilt tripping me for it for the foreseeable future. They also claim that this choice is me “losing touch with my Filipino culture”…. which I don’t really agree with at all but they partially blame the fact that I live in Canada. Related to this, they often suggest that my non-Asian Canadian boyfriend coerced me into making this decision. While I am very confident in my own autonomy here, it definitely worsens my parents perception/relationship with him

While they are stubborn in their views, it seems that so am I haha. I am an adult, financially independent, have already been living outside their house, and have the means to continue doing so. I still want to continue moving in with my partner, but I feel lost on how to rebuild my relationship with my parents, or how to even peacefully exist with them. What’s worse is that they are starting to take it out on my younger sister, who is still in college. She is aligned with me and sympathetic to my situation, and my parents know this and have threatened to cut her off financially if she ever does anything similar to what I’m doing. While I don’t think my sister will be moving in with a partner anytime soon, just the possibility that my actions could affect my sisters life like this is really scary. It’s gotten to the point that my mother went behind my back and asked my sister not to visit apartments for us when we were out of town, and to not help us with our housing search. Even pragmatic appeals don’t reach them. My parents would rather I go broke paying for my own place (super expensive!!!!) rather than share one with my partner.

How do I help them/give them the space they need to come to terms with the situation? How can I protect my younger sister? And more importantly, how do I survive the upcoming holiday season with a barrage of judgmental aunties and uncles lol… If you’ve gone through a similar scenario I’d love to hear your story - especially if you come from a similar cultural background! Family is important to me, but so is my independence.

"> While I don’t think my sister will be moving in with a partner anytime soon, just the possibility that my actions could affect my sisters life like this is really scary. 

It will not be your actions in that case, it's their actions toward your sister. You are not responsible for your parents' attitudes. Your sister knows what's on the line and can make her own choices.

Practice variations of ""I love you and I understand your concern, but this is my choice to make."" Repeat it as many times as necessary to as many family members as needed. ""I know you want to protect me and I'm grateful for that, but I also need room to make my own mistakes."" Etc. Validate their feelings while shutting down any attempt to change your situation."

"Your parents are adults, they know exactly what they are doing to try to get you to do what they want (guilt /manipulation). I highly suspect that after you move in together and realize their tactics didn't work on you, that they will slowly come to accept the situation. Not saying they will ever really like your partner or you living together, but maybe chill with the dramatics.

Ultimately your parents decide how much they want to let this affect their relationship with you, the important thing for you to do is whatever you want to do. If you being an individual separate from your parents is what causes your relationship to fall apart, then it was never really good in the first place. It's a hard pill to swallow when you realize that your parents love is conditional. 

I hope it turns around eventually, but if not, keep reminding yourself that you are simply living your life, it's not your fault. Your sister will soon have to go through what you just did in asserting her independence from your parents.

That's what I'm hoping for! But ultimately I can only do so much to change how my parents view the whole practice of co-habitating before marriage. In my ideal world, me doing all of these things before my sister makes it easier for her in the future, prepares my parents for the inevitability of these things.... unfortunately they seem to see it as me being a bad role model for my sister. It's frustrating because this undermines her autonomy as well - she is able to make her own decisions without my influence. I suppose only time will tell?

"My friend has been dating this guy since February and the things she tells me about him are enough for me and all her other friends to tell her to dump him. He yells at her, blocks her on social media, calls her fat, ""punishes"" her for not inviting him to her all-female family trip with her relatives who speak a different language by ignoring her texts and calls the entire time she was away.  that's just to name a few things. 
Yet after all the stuff she tells me about him, she still asks, ""does it sound like he's just not that into me?"" and ""he's just not that committed to me.""  I am so surprised that THAT is her takeaway from this. I say, is that really the question you should be asking? to me, it doesn't matter if he's ""into her"" . is SHE into him? does she want to be treated like this?  It seems her primary concern is worrying about how much he loves her. My thought is: the way he treats her shows he either doesn't love her or that it doesn't matter because he isn't treating her right.

Is there a way to get her to see that? becuase it is starting to be very frustrating to talk to her because she will go over all the ways he treats her that sounds pretty disrespectful and unloving, and she'll always circle back to, ""do you think he'll call?!""  

I don't know what to tell her anymore. I am clearly not getting through to her. I don't agree with this relationship. I know it's not my decision, but she clearly hates it when he does these things because she complains about them. so I don't understand why she still cares about whether he's ""into"" her and be worried that the relationship might end. I think it would be a good think if it did!

right now they are ""broken up"" and based on their history, they will probably get back together.  she calls me for advice. not sure what to tell her anymore because i've made my stance pretty clear

Continue to reinforce that you care for her and think she deserves better. Don't attack him verbally, because that usually backfires and makes the victim defensive.

"Okay so there was one day where I felt something was wrong because he went to sleep with his phone under his pillow which he never does so I managed to grab it and I went through it. I saw that he had a girl blocked on WhatsApp and that she has his blocked too so I asked him about it. He lied and said that it was a friend who had traveled with him and was messaging him saying that she wanted to meet up but then he told her he has a girlfriend and blocked her. When he realized I wasn’t believing his story, he admitted that was a lie and told me the truth was that he had messaged the friend just to see how she’s doing but that her boyfriend responded and argued with him. Later on, I still didn’t feel like things were right and I did some digging on Facebook and found out that “friend” was his ex of 4 years. My bf and I have only been together for 5 months but anyways, besides the point. He then said that he was trying to contact his ex because he suspected that she was doing witchcraft on him. This is something he spoke to me about months ago, how she’s done witchcraft on him before and that they told him she might be doing it again because he was started to have a lot of problems and felt weird but he said the part of her bf responding was true. His ex even messaged me and told me that she indeed never spoke to him, that he called her several times on video call and didn’t pick up so then her bf picked up and started arguing with him. My bf says that he only messaged her and called her once but I don’t know what to believe anymore and I’m not sure if I even believe his reason for trying to contact her especially because he was starting to get his life together and wasn’t having anymore problems but according to him, he was scared of things getting bad again with his life and wanted to ask her if she had done witchcraft on him and why. I’m not sure if I can even trust the girl because she was telling me that she had spoken to his grandma and his grandma said that my bf told her that he doesn’t like me. My bf then messaged his grandma and asked if his ex had spoken to her and she said no that she has her blocked on everything and that she would never want to talk to his ex. You can tell that his grandma does not like the girl and it’s mostly because of horrible things that she did to my bf when they were dating, besides the witchcraft stuff. I don’t believe that she spoke to his grandma but I also done believe his reason for contacting her and I really don’t know what he was trying to do. His ex even said that he messaged her in January trying to get back together which I don’t know if it’s true, my bf told me to ask her for proof of the messages but I don’t care much to do that since him and I weren’t even dating in January. I feel like I’m going crazy because of all the times I’ve been lied to. 

**TL;DR;** : Basically, he contacted her because he was supposedly suspicious that she had done witchcraft on him but they never spoke because her bf picked up her phone and argued with him but my bf lied to me about the situation saying she was a friend and he was just trying to see how she was doing"	tokyiuo	post	21.271806945895	female	Hispanic	0.9980514049530029	na	na	na	3	relationships

"So we have been in a steady relationship for about a year now.

We have a lot of differences but also have been able to work it out pretty smoothly so far with conversations. We love each other and I can feel that he does feel deeply about me, as I do about him.

However, when it comes to expressing and showing the love as an action, I sometimes find myself longing for more from him.

For an example, I'm a type of person who loves to take care and do things for the person I love. Whenever he is sick, I always make sure he has everything he needs. Even if he doesn't tell me, I prepare things like tea / medicine that might be good for him.

Or whenever I'm outside and see food that I know he'll enjoy, I'll always pick some up for him because that's just one of many ways I like to express my love.

Now, I fully understand that that's just not how he was brought up, as I know that he had to be very independent from the early ages. Which is why he always tells me that I don't need to buy or do things for him. (although when I do, he is very grateful) But what is the point of being in a relationship if we can't depend / rely on each other?

He is also not the type to be affectionate in the public, so we rarely ever hold hands outside if I don't hold onto his hand. Which was a surprise to me in the early stage of the relationship, because he is super cuddly when we are by ourselves at home.

I think because our childhood was very different, the way we express ourseves are also different, so I feel conflicted.

These are some of the moments where I feel lonely in this relationship:

1. Not being asked what I need / to be extra cared for when I'm sick or stressed.
2. Not being more affectionate in public. (I don't mean excessive PDA, just holding hands would be nice)
3. Not greeting me at the door when I get home even though he isn't busy.
4. Not texting me to let me know that he's going to be home extra late.
5. Whenever I'm on my way home late, he doesn't say things like ""let me know when you get home"" (we don't live together)

Some of these I've brought up to him before, but honestly... none of these have been improved over the course of one year.

And when I do bring this type of topic up, his usual response is **I'm always the one that wants to make him change and do things, while he doesn't want me to change at all except just be myself.**

This is the part where that gets me confused, because in my belief, two people in a relationship can't just always remain the same as before but must learn to do things differently for each other.  
That doesn't necessarily mean that we have to completely change our personalities...right?Honestly, I don't know anymore.

Sometimes I feel like my needs are justified, and other times I feel like I'm asking too much from him.

Has anyone beein in this situation before?  
I would love to hear your opinions and experiences to guide myself in this relationship, as I really want to work things out and find a middle ground with him.

TL;DR - My needs of feeling loved / cared for aren't being met and I've talked to him about it several times. But he sees it as me trying to change him."	DJtheDJee	post	14.577407567986274	female	White	0.009685256518423557	na	na	na	6	relationships
You’ve addressed it multiple times and he’s telling you that he is unable to meet your needs.  You need to evaluate whether these are truly needs or if you can compromise.  How you give and receive love may be incompatible.	DJtheDJee	reply	na	na	na	0.009685256518423557	no	no	no	na	relationships
"Sounds like a bit of mismatch with love languages. We often focus on the type of love that we like to receive but there is another aspect to love language which is how we express love to our partners. The things that you are asking him to do might not be how he expresses love which is why he sees that as trying to change him. And you may get him to do those things but if it's not his natural love language then those actions won't feel genuine anyways. A great starting point is having a conversation where both of you go over the type of love you like to receive but also how each of you express your love so it becomes more recognizable when it occurs.

However, there is the main issue here which is that you aren't feeling satisfied/loved in the relationship. It's crucial and perfectly valid to express you need more love from your partner but steer the conversation so he understands he can decide how to express that love. Because love language works when both partners feel satisfied from the action, one partner feels love for receiving it and the other feels love for performing it. But for the performer to feel satisfied from it too, they need to feel that it was their decision and an action that they feel love for doing. But this ISNT an excuse that he doesn't have to do anything. It just might get him away from the mindset that ""you are changing him"" and back to the real situation which is that he needs to be putting more attention on the relationship."

"1 - When you're sick, you will have to ask him to do the specific things you want. You want him to anticipate your needs, but that isn't going to happen.

2 - Tell him you'd like to hold hands in public more often.

3-4) You said you don't live together, so these are a bit confusing. He's not a dog, so running to ""greet you at the door"" is a bit of an odd expectation. If you live together or are meeting up, he should definitely let you know if he is running late or expects to be late.

"I grew up with my friend ""Sarah"". Sarah has always been kind, supportive, caring, and genuine/sincere. Sarah and I have never had any sort of ""drama"". We've never really fought, been catty, gossipy, etc. There is absolutely ZERO ill will here.

However.

Sarah is awkward.

Like, with a capital A.

Maybe it wasn't really noticeable when we were younger. Or maybe everyone else kind of matured as we got older when Sarah didn't. But Sarah is really, really awkward. It's gotten to the point where it is draining being around her, and every time we do something together I need a while to recover before I can see her again.

**Example 1:** A group of 4 of us had pre-drinks at my apartment, and then went out to dinner. After dinner, the other 2 were ready to go home, but Sarah assumed that the 4 of us would go to back to my place to chat and hang out. Since we had no plans the next day, we all went back to my place. As the night got later and later, everyone was clearly feeling it. The three of us kept saying things like ""It's getting late. I'm getting tired. We should go."" but Sarah would plead ""Com'on, let's just keep watching this!"" repeatedly.

After that day, the other friends mentioned to me privately that they thought the whole night was exhausting because Sarah couldn't tell that everyone was just tired and wanted to go home.

**Example 2:** I hosted a large dinner party, and invited Sarah. I also invited another (non-mutual) friend who was a bride-to-be and I was one of her bridesmaids. The bride-to-be quickly pulled me aside to give me a surprise bridesmaids gift-package: a small box of chocolates and some other goodies. There weren't enough chocolates for the whole party, so I put the whole package away and went back to the party.

Everyone at the party was allowed to stay overnight (no drinking and driving on my watch) if they needed to. At the end of the night, everyone had gone home (DD/Rideshares). Sarah was the only one who stayed.

When I mentioned to my spouse that I was really thankful for the chocolates from bride-to-be, Sarah said ""Oh, did someone bring chocolates? Where are they?"". I explained to Sarah that a bride-to-be brought some chocolates for me, for being a bridesmaid, and I had put them away. My spouse doubled down that the chocolates were a gift for me and the reason I put them away was because there wasn't enough for everyone at the party. Sarah went to search for them and came back frustrated and reiterated, ""Where are the chocolates? I can't find them.""

I think she genuinely believed that the chocolates were for the dinner party, and now since everyone else was gone, it was okay to eat them. When I finally showed her where the gift package was (I don't mind sharing chocolates at the end of the day) I think she finally realized that it was a private gift for me, and not for meant for sharing. She didn't eat any chocolates, but I'm more concerned about how long it took for her to realize this, and how she kept hounding us for the chocolates despite how many times we tried to tell her they weren't for the party.

**Example 3:** Back in school when I was studying/working/doing homework, Sarah would sometimes just hover and watch. If we had plans later that day I would say things like ""Hey you can go ahead without me, I just need to get this done, I'll join you later."" and she'd say ""I can't leave, I'd feel bad if I left without you."" then she'd continue to stare over my shoulder.

It makes me super uncomfortable to have someone staring at me while I'm working. Anyone else might've been like ""I'll just watch youtube videos while I wait"" or ""Let me help you get this done faster"" or ""Sure, I'll go on ahead and see you there"".

But not Sarah. Sarah just... hovers. I've been told I'm not the only one she's done this to.

The list goes on and on.

None of it is ever malicious. I want to make that really clear. She always just toes the line of what is/isn't socially acceptable but never crosses it. I feel silly for even making a post. Looking at my examples, the things seem so minor.

She can't seem to read the mood of a room or of other people that well. I think she might have a hard time making new and maintaining old relationships because of this. She possibly might be lonely as a result and thus more eager/insistent when hanging out. I feel pressure to spend time with her, but at the same time, spending time with her can be so draining. She is incredibly well-intentioned and caring, she just doesn't know how to read a room. I don't think I can broach this subject with her without absolutely crushing her.

I suspect she might be on the spectrum. I don't know too much about all the ways autism can present itself so this is literally just speculation. She doesn't seem like my friends/family/clients/coworkers who are diagnosed/confirmed on the spectrum. She is much nicer/more caring, more sensitive/easily hurt, more eager for socialization/attention, and doesn't seem to have special interests, but what do I know? I'm no expert.

Basically my problem is two fold:

1. How can I maintain this friendship when being with her is draining?
2. How can I help her be less socially awkward so she can make and maintain more friendships for herself? I genuinely want the best for her and the best for our friendship.

tl;dr: I have a friend who is so awkward, her inability to read a room might be slowly isolating her. I feel a lot of pressure to spend time with her because she is a genuinely a good friend, and a kind, caring person. But her awkwardness makes it really draining to be with her for a long time. How do I approach this?

Small update: I try to be as absolutely as direct as I can with her. To the point I've been told that I 'm being rude. I mostly learned that way of communicating from interacting with other people on the spectrum. With Sarah it doesn't seem to work. She usually just keeps doing whatever she's doing."

You need to tell her that her holding money hostage is a breakup worthy event and it is an ultimatum. “Pay your fair share or we are gonna break ip. Never hold money hostage again or we are gonna break up. End of story.” (OP you need to be willing to follow through with the breakup too because what she is doing to toxic af and if you don’t hold her accountable now she will just keep doing it). 

2. Create a google doc spreadsheet (excel) for your finances. You should have 3 tabs on that excel file, the first tab for your income and expenses, the second tab for her income and expenses, and a 3rd tab for your joint income and expenses. On these tabs you will list out how much you made in your paychecks each month, as well as a breakdown of what you spent. (It will literally each of you going through your bank statements and listing all your expenses, every case of beer, pack of cigarettes and fast food order gets listed here; your partner gets to see how you are spending their money and vise versa. You two have to be on the same page when it comes to finances and this is the best way my partner and I have found to do it). 

3. Open a joint account together. Both of you contribute 50%. (If your rent is $1500 both of you put $1,000 in so you have $500 extra every month to add into savings, this built ip savings will be what you guys use to pay for major couples purchases, ranging from moving to new homes, to emergencies, to vacations). This joint account does not get a debit card, neither of you can pull money or spend money out of it without the other person knowing. The primary thing this account will pay for is rent/housing so you can pay everything via wire transfer. 

In all honesty it sounds like this girl is a walking red flag if she’s holding money hostage and destroying your things.

Her cancellation of the funds too support this theory.

"The money that your ex (that's not a typo) owes you is most likely lost.  Your best chance to recoup it is to take some of her stuff to ransom when you move out, but that carries its own risks.  You need to focus on minimizing any future losses.  She will probably trash any and everything that she can get her hands on once she realizes that you are escaping.  Do not tell her know that you are moving, do not tell any friends that you are moving.  Just quietly remove your most important documents and possessions.  Keep in mind that the pictures from your childhood are irreplaceable, but your tv was obsolete the day you brought it home.  A small storage unit is a small price to pay to hold on to your most precious memories.  Doing a reorg of all your stuff is a good way to obscure the fact that some of it is no longer there.  Move when she is working, or if possible, on a weekend trip with friends.  Block her number, but be prepared for her to call to curse you out from another number.  Never talk, use texts.

"That’s not at all what “being a nice person” is. This is straight up abusive. And I hate to say this, but you sound exactly like the textbook stereotype of what someone with an abusive partner says. 

This isn’t love. This isn’t what love looks like. This stuff happens in absolutely ZERO percent of actual healthy relationships. 

Her having helped you through tough times doesn’t make her a good person. That means she did something that was either kind at the time, or she helped you because it would benefit her in some way. But doing this stuff, these are things that nice/good people don’t ever do, ESPECIALLY to someone who they supposedly love. 

This is not what love looks like. And I’m sorry, because the fact that you think that, or the fact that you think she’s a good person, means that you haven’t experienced an actual good person or actual love and man, that really sucks. But that’s how this happens. Someone gets treated like shit from those who are supposed to care about them, so that’s the baseline they have. If you were raised in prison by nothing but rapists and murderers, then someone who only shoplifts would sound great. But they aren’t great. They just aren’t the same type of bad as all the people you’d known. Your NormalMeter™️ is broken. So you consider this absolute piece of shit person to be a good person, because you don’t have a healthy baseline for what “good” actually is. 

Absolutely none of this will improve until you are not only no longer in a relationship with this person, but it won’t improve until this person is completely out of your life. That should be your top priority at the moment. Then, shop around for a therapist. If you don’t click, find another until you find one that you do click with. Because, leaving her isn’t gonna fix your  NormalMeter™️. Your meter is still gonna be broken. So the possibility that you repeat these same mistakes in choosing a partner is astronomically high. The right therapist can help you fix your NormalMeter™️, and that can allow you to make better choices about who you allow into your life, and who you allow to STAY in your life. 

It’s not your fault that you can’t see this. But it’s become your problem and solving it has become your responsibility, because nobody else can do it for you.

"I had a partner like yours. Absolutely great on her good days, but downright vindictive on her bad.

I got rid of her. I got tired of walking on egg shells. I got tired of apologizing for every little thing that happened even if it wasn't my fault. She'd pick a fight with me, I'd end up staying up the entire night afraid out of my wits that she was going to break up with me, she'd go right off to bed, have a great sleep, wake up, and she acted like it never happened.

Before I even said something, I had to analyze in my head first if there was a way she could take it wrong and start a 5 hour long argument.

She was never once physically abusive. Never. It was 1000% mental. She must have said *""We're breaking up""* at LEAST once every two weeks. Minimum. She broke up with me for three hours because a fast food joint got her order wrong. We were both in the car, went home, she found out, and got mad at me because I didn't open and check before we left. And she was 2 feet next to me. Even after I offered to go back out and get her order again.

A breakup, over a wrong damn order.

She broke up with me once because my grandmother had cancer and was dying. She came with me to see her because everyone thought she didn't have long. Well she wanted to go home and go to bed, I wanted to stay and visit for another hour. I even offered to drive her home and drop her off so she could sleep.

"After that long the best/easiest thing to do is to have an account specifically for shared expenses.  If you are still borrowing from each other and trying to get paid back... that is childish behavior, you aren't acting like partners, just two friends.  

Create a shared account, have an expected amount each will cover for monthly expenses (based on whatever makes sense for the partners).  If there is an issue where one can't cover their expenses they can focus on covering the expenses.   Conversations should be around why there are issues covering expenses, and bigger conversations about long term plans... but after 11 years if you haven't matured at all in handling expenses you aren't building a partnership... which goes back to most of the advice in this thread...

How is keeping finances separate (but still pooling money to pay bills) not trusting someone?

So if I want to buy my husband a present, it comes out of the joint account? That is kind of silly.  Also, after 25 years my ex left me high and dry.  And if a joint account isn't set up right, it could be stuck in probate when someone dies.  And I have kids, adult, but I still spend money on them, should current husband be paying for the stuff I do for them?  And if I get a check from my parents for my birthday, then it has to go in the joint account? Same with if he gets a check for something?  There should be three accounts, his, mine, ours.  Helps too when tracking expenses for taxes.  His work related stuff etc is easy to find in his account, has going back to school he can trace it there, house stuff is in the joint account, yada yada yada. And of course retirement stuff.

"Basically what the title implies.

I’ve been dating this girl for about three years now. However, it’s come to the point where I’m really getting fed up with her lack of punctuality.

To start, she physically cannot wake up to alarms. She’s tried many different ways to fix this, but to no avail. It goes without saying, but I’m the one who has to turn these alarms off as I actually am awakened lol. It may be hard to believe, but even when I try shaking her whole body it doesn’t always do the trick. I hate feeling like I’m having to babysit a grown adult. Despite my efforts to get her up on time and ensure she has a pleasant morning, she’s still 15-20 minutes late every day to her job. 

There was also a time when I was working a contract job at the beginning of the year. It just so happened that it was very close by to my partner’s place of work. Being that my love comes in acts of service l, I offered to drive her to work since it would be easier for her- big mistake. I would be waiting outside of her house at 8:30 for her, and it would sometimes take her 10-15 minutes to come outside. It came to a point where I called her from the car and told her that this arrangement wasn’t going to work anymore, to which she responded very negatively to.

I have since back tracked from that statement, yet I have always carried this guilt of not being a caring enough partner. My girlfriend was diagnosed with ADHD a little over a year ago. This wasn’t much of a surprise to me. However, it did put a lot of her behaviour into perspective. She’s been taking a medication that was prescribed to her, but if I’m honest, I haven’t noticed much of a shift in her behaviour.

This was self-evident when we were in Europe together this past July. I had been there solo for a month before she came, and hadn’t been late for one train, plane or any other event. The moment she showed up, however, we were just managing to make it to our trains with a minute or two to spare. As you can probably tell from this post, punctuality is a big thing for me personally. I hate being late, especially when it’s not own doing. I would advise us to leave earlier from places so that we could make it for our departure ahead of schedule, but she would usually brush it off saying “we have enough time”.

I’m having a hard time understanding my place in this situation. Am I being a bad guy by not accommodating more for her disorder? Is driving her to and from work, making her breakfast, and trying to understand her not enough? I do love her, but this aspect of our relationship truly blurs the vision of us being together.

TL;DR My girlfriend is late to everything. She was diagnosed with ADHD, but the medication hasn’t seemed to help. Not sure what this means for us as a long term relationship."	No-Contract-6371	post	30.0521835001353	male	White	0.9979324340820312	na	na	na	78	relationships

"One thing that helps is lying about start times. My dad is severely ADHD and often doesn't even realize Ive lied about the start time because he just does not pay attention to anything. He is also pretty easy going tho, and doesn't mind me lying, your gf might be different. Another thing that helps is giving time warnings (30 mins to go, 20 mins, ok I'm leaving in 5 minutes) and then sometimes just leaving within 5 minutes of when you said you would. Yes, the other person gets mad but 1. My feelings/time are important too,  2) I think it's better than spending the whole event in a sour mood. Your gf is an adult and you should talk with her right now about finding her own transportation if she doesn't go with you. (again she will be mad.

"What did she do to arrive for work or class on time before you started to wake her up every morning? Did her parents or a previous partner wake her up, or was she always late to work or school? Did she have a system she used to get herself places on time without anyone helping her at any point in her life so far?

Has she ever received any real consequences because of running late, such as being fired, having to reschedule, or not being able to do an activity she cared about?

She's 22, being that she's so young is it possible she's never had any big problems due to being late and always had a parent or someone helping her in the mornings? It is possible that she just takes for granted that someone else will handle making sure she's awake and on time, and doesn't see the need to be responsible for herself. 

There are tons of people with ADHD who have figured out a system to keep themselves from running late to everything, and who have found ways to make sure they get up every morning on time without depending on someone else. 

ADHD is not a good excuse, she needs to start making an effort to try different ways to improve getting up and getting places on time. It might be trial and error, but she cannot go through life depending on others to do it for her. She cannot just try one thing and quit, and she cannot just keep doing the same things that don't work. 

She is putting too much responsibility on you to make her get up, make her leave on time, risk you being late to work and other places. It's just inconsiderate and taking advantage of your willingness to help. It's also rude to the people she works with, people she goes places with, everyone who has to wait around for her or miss out on stuff because she's late. 

My advice is to stop waking her up. Leave to go wherever you're going within 5 minutes of the time you need to leave, and leave her behind if she isn't ready (give warning like 10 minutes before you need to go). Stop enabling her and allow her to fail or succeed on her own."	No-Contract-6371	reply	na	na	na	0.9979324340820312	no	strong	strong	na	relationships
"The adhd makes sense but being late is something that she can overcome. I have adhd, I'm early to everything. I can imagine she's struggling with a new diagnosis and the slow trickling realization that her whole life had been affected by it her whole life. It's a trip, believe me. She could come to terms with it tomorrow or next week or next month, or maybe it will be years. Even then there's no guarantee she'll stop being late to everything.

If you think you can live with that, stay and see if you can support her through what she's dealing with. If you feel like her being late is disrespectful and negatively impacting you, break up and give her the space to figure it all out. Chronic lateness is a big big adhd thing though, very common. 

Either choice is good and it's yours to make. I feel like it takes a certain kind of person to deal with adhd, even when treated. If you don't feel like that's you that's okay, it doesn't make you a bad person. It just means you're incompatible. If you look at the adhdwomen subreddit you might recognize some other behaviours in the stories being shared. It won't solve anything but it might help you feel less alone in what you're experiencing.

To clarify, adhd doesn't make a person automatically always late or unbearable or not worth the effort. However, the expression of symptoms and other quirks and issues can make it tough for a partner to navigate. It's okay not to want to commit to that.

">My girlfriend is late to everything. She was diagnosed with ADHD, but the medication hasn’t seemed to help. Not sure what this means for us as a long term relationship.

It means that she's not taking her disability seriously enough, and that's she's not putting sufficient effort into into employing mechanisms that will enable you to have a future together - or for her to even hold down a job! 

It means that over time you will lose whatever respect you have left for her, and find it more and more annoying, until you get to breaking point and end the relationship in desperation.

Yes, ADHD is a real issue, yes medication can help, but it won't help nearly as much as her deciding that being on time to meet you is **actually important**, and taking whatever steps are necessary to ensure that happens. Even if it means that she plans to turn up a couple of hours in advance - and that if that results in her actually arriving early and having to sit and read a book for a couple of hours, accepting that it's a price worth paying. 

What should you do right now? Entirely up to you, but if she's looking into systems where she prepares for things in advance (sets out clothing / things to take the night before) and sets reminder alarms it might be worth giving the relationship a second chance, even if she still fails on occasion.

"Hi, I am that person. I’m late for everything. It takes a massive amount of planning and effort not to be late. To start, I do have diagnosed ADHD and take medicine for it. Unfortunately, it’s a cruel trick that to treat ADHD you have to remember to take medicine, so I’m not perfect at taking it. I know everyone assumes, and will say that it’s a lack of respect for other people and other peoples time, but I assure you, it’s not. I try so hard. 

I get stuck in vicious loops. I plan to be early. I don’t want to just sit and twiddle my thumbs while waiting to leave, so I decide to do something that should only take a few mins. I go to do task a, but on the way to doing task a, I see task b, so I get sidetracked and look at task b, and on the way to finish task b, I see task c… suddenly I look at my phone time and I’m late.

I said a timer to remind me to leave. The timer goes off, but I’m in the middle of some thing that should only take a minute to finish. I turn off the timer. I finish the task. But then I have already forgotten about the timer. 

Or I plan to be early, only to realize that I need to stop for gas. Now I’m late. Did I think to put a reminder in my phone to leave early to get gas or write myself a note? Of course. However, I think of doing that while I’m driving and by the time I get home and park, I have forgotten.  

Or I’m ready to go and going out to the car only to realize that I forgot to grab my phone. Or my keys. But where the eff are they?? Routines help and designated spots help, but they’re not full proof. If I get off the routine or something interrupts me on the way to use that designated spot it doesn’t happen.

For a very long time, I had a completely misguided sense of how long it would take to get anywhere. Now I look it up and map it out before I go every time. 

These are all things that are mostly well managed by my ADHD meds. But like I said, I have to remember to take those. I’ve gotten a LOT better. My kids suffered when school first started and I struggled hard to get into a good routine and sense of timing that would get them to school on time.  The last thing I ever wanted was for them to feel responsible for my lateness or be affected by it. So I put in the effort and mental load to be early or on time for everything. It’s exhausting. I know it sounds silly, but it really is. The amount of work I have to put in to make my brain focus brakes me sometimes. And it doesn’t always work. And they hate being late. And I hate being late. And I hate making them late for things. So I try my fucking hardest. 

I wish my husband understood more how hard I try, but he really does not get it at all. He does not get the way my brain works, or rather fails to work.  I know it’s frustrating for everyone, and no one hates myself over it more than I do. 

I guess all of that is to say that it it might not be a disrespect or lack of courtesy thing. It might be something like this. If you love her, you can find ways to help her cope.  If you don’t love her enough to do that, that is totally fair, and if it is due to ADHD or something like that, it may get better, especially with meds, but it will never totally go away.  you need to decide whether it’s something you can live with or not."

"I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child. I was perpetually late to everything, and would rarely manage to be on time. People around me chided me frequently. On a number of occasions, I paid ""no-show"" fees for being more than 15 minutes late to medical appointments or was late so frequently that they dismissed me as a patient. Despite the consequences, I still struggled with tardiness.

I'm in my 30s now, and on stimulants for my ADHD. I tried 4 different medications before I found one that worked for me. It helps me organise my thoughts, makes my executive dysfunction easier to overcome, and allows me to stay focused on tasks that aren't particularly engaging. However, medication by itself isn't enough. I also had to make some changes to my habits in order to compensate for my neurodivergence. Here are some of the changes I've made that really helped me:

1.) Whenever I have an event (like a dinner reservation) or appointment that requires me to show up at a certain time, I put it into my phone calendar IMMEDIATELY. Even if I'm in the middle of talking to someone, I will excuse myself by saying, ""one sec, I need to put this in my calendar right away or I'll forget"" and put the appointment in my phone. I have the default reminder alarm set to go off half an hour before I need to leave for the appointment. If the appointment is more than a week away, I also set a reminder for the day before. I also have a Fitbit, which will give me vibrating alerts from my phone calendar. This is helpful because I frequently put my phone down somewhere and forget where I put it. The Fitbit ensures I never miss an alert. Everything from ""remember to cancel the free trial of XYZ service"" to ""take out dinner to defrost now"" is in my calendar and it helps a lot. I use Siri to set reminders so I frequently don't even have to pick up my phone.

2.) I started wearing a Fitbit. I have extreme time blindness and never know what time it is, as well as the day of the week or date. The Fitbit is great because it tells me the time, day, and date, as well as giving me calendar alerts. I have all other kinds of notifications turned off, so if my Fitbit vibrates I know it's important and don't automatically tune it out. I have the Inspire 3, which is small, waterproof, and the battery lasts all week. I charge it overnight on the weekend and I'm good to go.

3.) I always add a minimum of ten minutes to travel time, or longer if I'm driving during rush hour or a long distance. My calendar app will tell me the estimated time it takes me to get to my destination, and I can set my alarm to go off X number of minutes before I need to leave the house to reach my destination on time. If it says it will take 10 minutes to arrive, I add 10 minutes to the travel time and plan accordingly. If it's during rush hour or something, I add more time accordingly.

Those are three things I do without fail now and they have made a huge difference. I'm never late, and usually arrive early. Knowing that I can rely on my alarm frees up space in my head and allows me to focus on other things instead of feeling paralysed by the idea of having an appointment I need to keep an eye on the time for. 

At the end of the day what it boils down to is that I value other people's time, and that is what motivated me to make these changes. If the motivation isn't there, then nothing will actually change. You cannot force someone to care about something they don't want to care about. If she wants to change, it's definitely possible with a relatively small amount of effort. Have a talk with her about her tardiness and ask if it is something she wants to change. If she doesn't, it won't happen and you need to consider if that is a dealbreaker for you. If she does, then it is her responsibility as an adult to manage her own time and adapt her behaviour. While it's perfectly reasonable for you to help her with this now and then, the mental load of monitoring the time for two people is exhausting and will assuredly breed resentment in time. I wish you both the best and hope for the most favourable outcome. If you have any questions or would like some more suggestions, feel free to reply or reach out via DM."

"I have ADHD I set out my clothes and shoes the night before,  because if I can't find what I need I'll have a meltdown plus my partner gets anxious if we're late. Alarms I get up to so that isn't an issue, my partner we are pretty sure is Autistic so never ever late for anything, if I have an appointment he will make sure I am there on time, he will do a countdown and even help me to get dressed and do my shoes up if needed, he's incredible and in return I try my hardest to hit the time he asks for. Maybe try targets ""if you meet me outside by 8am exactly I'll buy us coffee or breakfast"", giving her that positive goal that she wants will help her to get there on time. If she's late even by one minute she doesn't get it and be strict or she'll think oh I was late yesterday by 3 mins and that was fine sure and extra 2 won't matter. We suffer badly with time blindness but if we want something bad like a cute morning date that'll be our hyperfocus. I feel you need to be writing this post to ADHD women ask them for advice, there is no point in asking people who are not ADHD they don't have the same mind they don't understand the exhaustion we have and that isn't on them but they can't give advice on something they don't have. We only figured out he had autism because I was doing an online quiz for myself as thought I may have a couple trates and I was sat there thinking that's him not me... so I got a low score he got highly functioning autism (theres like 4 types and then different levels) so then we did more tests and watch video's and did more research we're 99% sure he has it. He's very black and white and everything has to be fare, everyone should be treated the same and follow the same rules, everyone should be on time and if their not he gets irritable, I don't want to irritated or give him anxiety so since I learnt that I have become much better at being on time for him. She may also have RSD and it's worth you seeing if you have any Autistic trates yourself."	No-Contract-6371	reply	na	na	na	0.9979324340820312	no	strong	no	na	relationships

Your not her parent and should not have to act like it. It is one thing to remind every now and then for big events like dinner with family or plane/bus time but on the daily nope. She can't adult herself then you do not need to either. I would frankly stop vacations/trips and dinner dates or family dinner/get togethers or just go yourself and she can fend for her self to get there or just not come. But tell her even if she loses her job that is not on you and she still has to pay her portion of the bills or move back in with her parents as that is not your job as she is just a GF not a mother to your children wife that stays home as a stay at home parent.

"I think it would be very kind and caring for you to *help* accommodate her disorder (which it sounds like you’re already doing), but it really is something she needs to learn to manage on her own as well. You wouldn’t be a bad person for not making any effort to help her though. 

I have ADHD and struggle with time blindness. Back when I was 18 I made the choice to get it under control and while it took some time, it’s definitely possible. The downside is that now I’m so anxious about being late that usually I arrive too early. But, this has never bothered me as I’ll just sit in my car and play on my phone or do something else until it’s closer to time for whatever event. Now my partner is the habitually late person and it drives me crazy. 

Showing up late on a consistent basis is incredibly disrespectful in my opinion.

And I have a lot of trouble getting into side quests when I’m supposed to be doing other things! But I value being punctual and I value the time of others and that stops me from being late or getting time blind. 

If you’ve brought it up many times with her and she isn’t doing anything to help herself stay on time, this isn’t the person you should be with. You’ve made it clear to her that punctuality is important to you and she isn’t listening. She doesn’t seem to want to change. I think another talk with her laying it out that if this aspect doesn’t change, you can’t continue. It’s a deal breaker. See what she says and more importantly, what she does to improve.

I don't know. It seems if she's having difficulty even waking up when you're using force as well as alarms, there might be more to the issue for that portion.

 struggle with the exact same thing, is unmedicated bc meds make me feel like shit... she should probably see someone about this. Time blindness/ executive dysfunction can be real and WORSE, especially if said person with ADHD is stressed or more overwhelmed than usual.  It's not your responsibility, though, to parent her, maybe encouragement and support would be good, but she's an adult and needs to learn to do these things for herself as much as she can. Therapy / life coaching could be great for her.  I was late diagnosed at 16, and honestly [edit] if she was JUST diagnosed last year she's dealing with a life's worth of struggles that she probably didn't even realize where problems until she got diagnosed. It's a lot harder to juggle than people think it is. My late dx adhd led me to permanent psychosis because my parents just told me i was lazy for so long while just watching me struggle [as early as 8 years old]  that I started to believe it and now have severe self doubt about being able to do anything successfully.

"Giving a neutral perspective.

ADHD is a condition. It should not be used as an excuse. 

Just like in case of physical ailments, only taking medicines do not do the miracle. Its food, exercise, and many other lifestyle changes do the trick

Similary, just taking medicines might not count as giving full effort to fix it. Lifestyle changes like pre planning a few things, not committing to a plan if you can not be punctual, politely letting your partner know that they can go alone to office etc. count as taking active steps. 

You should suggest that she take frequent health checkups. Vitamin deficiencies can increase body pain, lack of focus etc. which affects other areas of life, including being punctual.

Let her sleep if she wants to. I have heard that people with adhd do not have quality sleep. This they prefer to sleep till late and disturbing that can ruin their day. Try not to schedule your life around hers. 

DO NOT TRY TO FIX HER. ITS NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. 
More and more child like treatment she will get, she will become more accustomed to it. Give suggestions, but do not try to fix it for her. Life has a way to fix a few things.

At the same time, your time is as important as her time/sleep. Figure out the areas where you can compromise.

I have been married for years to someone who is late for everything. We have a daughter who has ADHD, and she is also late for everything. I am just the opposite; not only do I prefer to be on time, I feel more comfortable being a bit early. We live in a city, and issues surrounding traffic and public transportation usually mean that getting around is a challenge, and I feel very anxious when I know I have to be somewhere and I am constantly waiting for my wife and daughter to get out the door. The way I see it, there are worst things than being with people who are consistently late, but it does stress me out. I guess I've just learned to accept what is as opposed to what I want it to be.

"My sibling has ADD and severe time blindness. As you can see here there is a mixed opinion on here about this even from those with an ADHD diagnosis some saying to accommodate, others saying there is no excuse.

What I will emphasize is every person with adhd is different, and the will have different impacts. Both my siblings have adhd and I probably have it myself (I’m diagnosed with dyslexia and dyspraxia).

One of my siblings has adhd lots of hyperactivity and generally can be on time for things.

I am usually a little late 10-15 mins or so but for super important things I can make myself be on time. But I really really struggle just waking up in the morning and it takes me a long time to feel human 

My other sister has ADD and has a severe time blindness. She will be hours late. Actually she has had issues since Childhood about this. She is also in a relationship and I think her partner gets frustrated and she has had issues with work also. She is on meds and the issue still exists  

I used to get super frustrated about this. Like I have no problem being being a bit late but no hours late especially when I have plans.
However, I don’t think she is malicious about this or intentional. It’s just who she and to me it’s a disability. Note every person with adhd is different so one person saying they do not have time management issues with adhd does not mean another person doesn’t have issues.

So with the time blindness being a disability- it’s always good to have compassion and that’s not to say a person shouldn’t try improve their situation eg therapy or coaching to improve time management just like someone with depression should have therapy etc.

So the question is- is she willing to try a little to improve herself a little?. Equally in a relationship you should always put yourself first- it’s entirely reasonable to say that you do not have the capacity to deal with this issue (even if it is a disability). The chances are even with therapy, meds etc the time management will not be fixed and this is who she is long term."	No-Contract-6371	reply	na	na	na	0.9979324340820312	no	strong	no	na	relationships

"Just as a note, I've been the Neurodivergent partner/Friend that was given these reminders and discussions about how ""inconsiderate"" being late is. I don't want to be late to things, especially important things. However time blindness is a very real and very difficult symptom for lots of neurodivergent people. 

I only bring this up because I recently had an in-depth conversation with a number of neurodivergent friends who have been on the receiving end of these reminders and found that most of us felt very guilty and resentful of them. Sometimes it feels like a reminder that our brains can't just ""function normally"" because while we can definitely find coping mechanisms that work for us we can't erase time blindness. Personally I feel worse when I'm already struggling to get ready in time and my partner  reminds me that we're going to be late.

If I have to be there by 10, I make sure that I’m ready to leave by 10:30, so if I happen to be running behind, there’s still a little window before I’m officially late.

Totally agree! Getting a late diagnosis can be really difficult to cope with and meds don't fix everything, but if OP really feels like this is more than just not having found a coping skill that works for her and is more actively not caring he Definitely needs to adress it with her.

"Many of us are aware. Very, very aware. But that doesn’t mean we are always able to fix it, or at least fix it on any sort of timeline. So yes, if the person is dismissive or truly doesn’t understand, this may be useful. But I’d say focusing more on proactive steps will be much more productive. And ways to protect your time as best you can- what will you do if the steps fail? If I’m x late, will you leave without me?

You don’t owe anyone your time, but recognize that they may legitimately be trying their best. You can decide that’s not workable you for you long term, that is entirely reasonable.

"I have actively taken steps to combat my time blindness and work to find coping mechanisms that work for me. But those are not fool proof and sometimes (even more so with extreme stress) I run behind and am late to events or work etc. 

>t's likely that those left waiting for your repeatedly feel resentful of you 

Maybe this is a misunderstanding of what I wrote, but I never said that we were resentful of the people reminding us, but of the reminders themselves. I think that this comes from many of those reminders essentially treating us like children. 

>have an adult conversation about WHY the chronic

This *is* the solution. Find what works for your partner not by telling them what you are going to do but by collaborating on what works for both parties. My partner and I have had many conversations about what works for me, for us, and what can help when those things aren't working. Never once has my partner resented me for any of these instances. Been frustrated or annoyed at the situation sure but he's never been upset *at* me for a part of my brain I can't rewire as long as I'm working on making it work (his words not mine) 

I know tone can be difficult to read on the internet but I didn't mean it as a dig at you or anything.

Yes, I had a friend who was chronically 30 minutes late meeting me. I worked two demanding jobs. She wouldn't even say she was late and would be x amount of time. I gently pointed out this was stressful for me because I could have gotten some extra work done, or settle in to read a book, but instead I was in wait mode.

"Hey Reddit,

I'm (28F) an American living in Europe I won't say where for anonymity. I met my husband (30M) during the pandemic and when restrictions were lifted I made the journey to meet him. We were smitten, and I moved over and we now have a child. My mother (55F) tries to come over several times a year to come see me and our little one. She usually stays about a Month. Which is great when it comes to quality time with her grandchild, but our relationship is quite tumultuous.

I grew up in a very authoritarian single parent household. My mother is misogynistic, has never been financially stable, and doesn't align in the same political opinions of either of her children. Growing up she forced us to go to a very toxic ""Church"" who labeled me a ""Bad seed"". She even at one point threatened to kick me out over not wanting to attend once I turned 18. I could go on and on about that Church, but that's another story. She was also very harsh with her punishments. Including taking our doors for several months when I was a teen, my door knob so I wouldn't lock my doors, and grounded me from going outside or seeing my friends besides at school for 6 months. She is very impulsive as well, often changed jobs, would constantly have us move houses or go back to live with our grandparents. Which honestly was our saving grace for alot of my childhood. And she is a very argumentative and basically always wants to talk about conservative politics even knowing I've asked her to try not to bring up these topics as it is harming our relationship. She is a very loving mother and I know she does love and wants the best for me. I'm also aware I need therapy.

The problem I'm having is she told me recently she was going to work on her career (which I will also not divulge) towards moving here for work. She wants to live closer and maybe even eventually live with us. Our relationship is very complicated, but I love her and want her to be happy. I just would rather have our relationship still be at a distance. I know I can't control her actions, but how do I tell her I'd rather her not try to come and live with my family. My husband would also not like this. 

So Reddit what do you think? 

TD;LR: My mother told me of her 5 year plan to come live near me. We have a very complicated relationship where I would rather us stay at a distance. How do I tell her gently?"	HayThereSunshine	post	21.40328904393963	female	White	0.9686450958251953	na	na	na	4	relationships

"My (18F) mum (61F) was discussing a bad dream she had, where she was in a foreign country with my family and I, and she lost her shoes so she had to get a new pair. In her dream, she asked me to stay put while she went and got her the shoes. Apparently when she came back, I was gone. 

From this, my mum and I just casually discussed anything it could be related to and I brought up the fact that it could be about me going to university soon and my parents going to see the world. She agreed, and said that she gets anxious because ""you seem weak sometimes, like you don't have enough grit in things"". She continued by saying "" I mean that it seems like you need extra help in things."" This made me feel really, really shit about myself, and I said ""that's quite hurtful, and I'm quite insecure about that, just so you know"". Maybe it wasn't the right thing to say? 

I've had a thought in my head that I'm 'weak' for a while now, and it can get really difficult to move past it. So, I'm not sure what I should do or whether I should even be upset at her that she said that to me. 

To be honest, it's sent me into a bit of a spiral, and I'm questioning whether I actually am a weak minded person. A while back, I went through some stuff and it caused a bad 'victim mindset' to form, and I have been seeing someone to try and break out of it - which is honestly making this situation more confusing. It really sucks because I usually have a good relationship with my mum, but this year she has started to say some pretty out of pocket and sometimes hurtful things.  


Any help would be appreciated <3 

TL;DR: My mum called me weak and I don't know how to feel about it. "	pepthefrog05	post	8.534898674869085	male	White	0.9983413219451904	na	na	na	2	relationships
"Hi! I think as long as you are talking to someone to break free from your mindset, then you’re doing what you can. Also, please note that being a victim doesn’t mean you’re weak. Anyone can be a victim and also have a “strong” mindset. 

Also, I think when parents send kids off to university, it is very scary because it’s the first time they’re letting their children be 100% independent. At that point, they no longer have any say in day to day activities and can’t intervene when something goes a little awry. So your mom may be a bit nervous about that, but that’s a common feeling amongst all parents who have kids leaving their nest. I don’t think you should be upset at your mom. My parents said something similar to be before leaving the house, but they also said they trusted me to take care of my business and reach out to them if I was in any sort of trouble. 

When I was your age I had a close relationship with my mom too, and that final year before leaving for university was very taxing on our relationship, and she often said hurtful things to me. I’m not sure where that came from, and I’m not quite sure I’ll ever understand that period in our relationship (teen angst & an impulsively emotional mother?) but we are just as close today as we were back then. I think children leaving the home just stirs up a lot of emotions and sometimes parents aren’t quite sure how to handle those changes."	pepthefrog05	reply	na	na	na	0.9983413219451904	weak	no	no	na	relationships
"First up, let me say that sometimes parents screw up and say completely the wrong thing, or something they mean one way but it comes out another. (Source: am parent)

It sounds like your mum has her own anxieties - the thing is, anxiety is not reality. Just because you both have an anxiety-monster saying that you’re not strong enough, doesn’t make it so.

Your mum’s words are a reflection of her own anxiety around you moving to the next stage of your life, and nothing more.

The fact that you have come through hard stuff, recognised that you weren’t ok and sought help shows me that you are actually a strong person. You stood up and took action! That takes strength, courage and clarity.

The most important thing to remember is that it’s not weak to struggle or to need help. I think you may surprise yourself with how strong you actually are."	pepthefrog05	reply	na	na	na	0.9983413219451904	no	no	no	na	relationships
"Hey everyone,  
  
I'm in a bit of a tough spot right now and could really use some advice on how to navigate through this situation. I'll try to keep it concise.  
  
About 8 months ago, I \[27M\] ended a 10-year-long relationship with my ex-girlfriend \[28F\]. The relationship had its ups and downs, and we eventually decided to have a cool-off period due to constant arguments, but she ended up blocking me on social media. Shortly after, I got into a new relationship with an amazing girl\[26F\] who has been a great support and we've been together for 8 months now.  
  
Here's where it gets complicated. While I care deeply for my current girlfriend, I can't help but find my mind wandering back to my ex. We went through so much together, were there for each other during tough times, and shared countless memories. I've even created a secret social media account to keep tabs on her, which I know isn't healthy.  
  
It stirred up old feelings. I find myself daydreaming about the possibility of rekindling our connection, but I'm torn because I don't want to hurt my current girlfriend.  
  
I understand that what I did was impulsive, and I'm dealing with the consequences of my actions. I genuinely love my current girlfriend, but it's challenging to let go of the deep emotional bond I shared with my ex.  
  
I guess my main question is: How do I move forward from here? How do I come to terms with the end of such a long-term relationship and fully invest myself in my current one without the constant thoughts of my ex-girlfriend? I want to make the right decision without causing any unnecessary pain to those involved.  
  
Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this and offer your thoughts.

"Please bare with me; this will be long because it’s a multi year issue with a lot of background info needed to be provided 

I gotta go back some years for context, so we met the summer before 11th grade at 15-16. She only had been in 1 relationship for a few months at 13 and I was in a relationship for a year & a half at 14 (the last 8 months were long distance because I moved from CO to NV). We started dating in 2015 and I officially broke up with her at the end of 2019. 

In those 4 years I was cheated on several times through text and social media and when it happened again, but physically, I was done. I was her first serious relationship and it was hell basically having to help her understand things such as another guy can’t take you out or all on you. So many red flags that I ignored but hey I was a kid in love. 

As time passed to graduation she became more obsessed with me and took the relationship way more seriously, but for me it was backwards because of the cheating. I went from giving her flowers all the time and wanting to see her 24/7 to cheating over social media like she was. And she found out a month after graduation and blew up on me. I took full responsibility but it ate at me how she did the same thing, but worse, more constant, and she only half ever took responsibility for the faults while half was my fault. Over the 4 years it was a consistent 4-5 months before she’d do something unfaithful. To clarify, it was 2 years into the relationship before I cheated and she didn’t cheat physically until the very end of the 4 years.

After me being caught it made me want to be better for her so I changed my habits with other females completely. She’d slip up a few more times to the point she felt I just wasn’t giving her what she wanted and that’s when she slept with someone else. It broke me because the change I tried to make for her was worthless and all her cheating the 4 years I found out on accident. The next 6 months consisted of her begging me to give her another chance before I changed my number and moved to another part of town.

Fast forward to September of 2022, at 23 I’ve improved my body, finances, mental, got a car now, and of course over the years I’ve talked to and went on dates with a few women. But for me they just weren’t her. She had so many similar life experiences, a similar way of life as I do, and so many similar interests. And I thought about her every few months. Come mid September, I find her instagram and offer to take her on a date. She accepts and we have a nice night out. In about 2 months we’re together again.

Around December I find out she flirted with and tried to talk to a handful of people I considered close friends, that she pursued a relationship with one of the people she cheated on me with, and that she’s still talking to an ex that came after me. That was probably the first night in my life I really almost lost it. I didn’t talk to her for days and she just blew my phone up throughout the days when she could. After hearing all the changes she said she’d go through for me and the future plans she wanted with me I tried with her again. Months of positivity pass until 3 months ago in May I find out she contacted her ex just because we had an argument. I really doubted this relationship until she did the same tactic of blowing me up, showing up to my house all the time, and crying while explaining how she’ll change for “us”. As usual I fell back into wanting the relationship. Is it the her not leaving me alone tactic that’s making me come back even though I think of the pain she’s caused me almost every day? Or is me loving her valid enough to put that to rest?

Another very important thing is our life situation currently. I live with my mom still because my family needs me. I’m the oldest of 4 and never had a father. Their father left during my senior year so I chose to help my mom and work after graduation even though I was an excellent student and had 2 scholarships (coulda made school work, I know). My gf has an older sister that she rents a house with, owned by their brother’s wife. Her brother and his wife fall out and at the beginning of February & evicts them. Since then they’ve been at suites while trying to get a new place and my gf has been with me 95% of the time because it’s full at the suites. I’ve helped them move several times, & helped her family getting places like for errands and to their storage. My milage has been up 60% since February. She started school recently and asked if I can help with her schedule, which I can. So since October I’ve taken her to work 99% of the time because I worry about her safety (she doesn’t drive), I pick her up every day, I take her to school right after work everyday, and pick her up from school late at night every night.

I mention these things I’ve done and do for her and her family along with my gas milage because it’s tiring. I haven’t asked for anything in return accept for me to be treated right. To my gf specifically I’ve only asked her to treat me better, show me more love because the cheating haunts me, and for more sexual pleasure. I think I deserve that at minimum. I’m here today because I’m tired of this. I don’t really have time for the gym anymore, I barely eat (went from 220 to 192 from September to now & I’m 6’2), my car is in constant use, I don’t have any savings anymore, and I don’t have time for any of my hobbies. Just pretty much work, her, and bills is my life. It’s not fair that I can’t even be pleased to somewhat tolerate this more. 

 I don’t enjoy life anymore. I’ve tried to be a man and just make her life easier but I’m slowly realizing it’s costing me the years I spent fixing my life. She promises to God all these things she’ll do for me but never does it stay. In December when I asked for more affection it lasted 2 weeks and I pointed it out, which she just waved off. She won’t change for me and it’s like I see everything wrong but I still love her and want to get past it all. But I don’t think I can anymore, I literally think about the cheating every day and that hot sour version of butterflies you feel in your stomach from being cheated on is almost permanent, I don’t accept it though nor am I okay with that.

My question is why do I feel wrong about debating if I should leave her? Why do I feel so bad that her life will get harder if I’m gone? I love her but my health is getting bad and I haven’t genuinely been happy in over a year, just random days here and there. Any feedback would be really appreciated I’m just hurt and stuck. I apologize for the length of this. I’m a person who prefers criticism and brute honesty. 

TL;DR: Gf whose cheated on me throughout 5 combined years won’t change for me even though I make her and her family’s lives easier and it’s ruining my mental & health. I feel bad for wanting to leave but I need to because I’m unhappy. So I want to know why I feel so wrong for debating this and what I should do going forward."

"We’ve been together nearly 3 years, live together and and we are generally a happy couple with no problems at all. 

My only issue, is that he has no ambitions or goals in life, because his whole life so far he has had everything handed to him on a silver platter. He is not independent, has never lived alone, doesn’t know how to cook, clean, do washing etc because his mum has done it all for him/not teached him growing up. He is a mechanic, every single job so far he has gotten because he or his family know the owner. He had the opportunity to start his own business last month, but then his old employer reached out to him and offered him a deal to work for him, so he did. He realised starting a business was a lot of work so he took the easy way out, and he has now been given everything from his old boss. A car, money, equipment etc.. I am 2 months away from finishing my bachelor degree and i am going overseas for 3 months as i’ve been saving over this year. He is not coming with me because he doesn’t know how to save money and it’s too much organising for him to go overseas. He doesn’t even eat breakfast or lunch at work because he never goes to the supermarket to buy ingredients, never does anything. I’m beginning to get really frustrated. 

I moved out of home when i was 18, have gone through about 6 jobs in the span of 4 years and i’ve worked really hard to get to where i am today, and I have so many plans for the future, but when i bring these up with him he doesn’t seem to care. Has anyone been through this? I can’t imagine breaking up with him, my family treat him as their own

"Seems like there’s also some sort of superiority complex. Just because you have a degree doesn’t mean shit. Lots of people who have a degree who are dummer then a sack of rocks. Also know, there are some people who have degrees that find their little piece of paper isn’t doing much for them. The fact that you mentioned it to compare what you’re doing as opposed to what he’s doing says something to me. That information wasn’t needed. If he has the money to travel with you, why should you say he doesn’t know how to be financially responsible enough to go?

Being a mechanic is being successful and you’re naive if you think people need to risk it all because they should to start their own business as opposed to working for someone else. It’s not easy in the slightest and comes with a lot of risks. Typically, referrals and knowing someone is a common way to get jobs in the trade industry.

Him not having life skills like cooking and cleaning is a byproduct of not being on his own, doesn’t mean he can’t learn though. But why should he have to live on his own and unnecessarily spend money on rent when his family is ok with him staying home? I wouldn’t waste money on rent if there wasn’t a reason to. Seems like his first reason was to live with you as you’ve stated he now lives with you.

You’re entitled to your own opinions and if you don’t feel it’s a good match then you should highly consider that fact. The internet is entitled to their opinion also and I believe you should take a step back to realize you’re only 22 and you don’t have it all together yet either.

If you want it to work you have to change your mindset and help him “grow.” You do also have to map out your future. If there are things like you say you don’t like, regardless of what anyone thinks, then you need to decide if it’s something you’re willing to compromise/fix or not.

Also, your degree should have taught you its “taught” not “teached”"	Educational-Mind-439	reply	na	na	na	0.9925198554992676	no	strong	no	na	relationships
"Not everyone has to have ambitions, and they certainly don't have to have the same kind of ambitions you do. Maybe his ambitions are different and you don't understand them. It sounds like he IS making progress in life, just not the way you want him to and you think he's getting ""everything handed to him"" instead.

Why should he start a business of his own if he has a good job he loves? Not everyone has to be a business owner.

Where the problem lies is that you do have different goals, and if the two of you can't talk about that and compromise on that and find solutions that you're both happy with, you'll be incompatible in the long run. 

A relationship shouldn't be about trying to change each other. Compromise is fine, but if you're expecting him to be a different person than who he is, you're going to end up investing a lot of emotional energy and getting very disappointed."

This is gonna be really long, and I'm sorry for that lol, but I just feel like I have to tell the whole story for it to make sense.

So basically, I met this girl on Instagram in October. First time we hung out, my intentions were purely friendly, I wasn't interested in her romantically at all, she was just a great friend. The second time around though, she brought me to a concert, along with her best friend and her sister. So far nothing out of the ordinary though, right? Well, right after the concert she texts me something along the lines of ""Not gonna lie, you looked REALLY good at the concert, but I was too shy to tell you, also my sister and best friend  loved you"". 

Next day, I asked her if I could come with her and send her away to the bus that goes to her town. She says yes. When we get there, and the bus comes, we hug each other really tightly, for probably about a minute while the bus is still there. She texts about how amazing the hug was, and how she wanted to hug me the whole time we were at the station even before the bus came, and I say that I wanted to hug her too. From there, we started sending each other those ""I wish I could hug you"", ""you're so cute"" type of wholesome memes, and I sorta caught feelings for her. 

A month later, I go to visit her. She takes me to a park there and we sit on a bench. After 5-10 mins. we started cuddling, stroking each other's hair and cheeks, nose rubs and all that. That lasted about 3-4 hours, before I had to leave. Sometime during that she says ""I've never had such intense hugs with anyone before"". After that we both agreed that it was really nice and that we should do it again.

I never got the courage to tell her how I feel, but since we did all that, I thought she was interested in me as well and was going to admit it sooner and later. Well, she didn't. Two months after that, we were discussing each other's love lifes, and she mentioned that she was seeing a guy for a week or so.

That destroyed me a bit inside, but I just said I was happy for her and we continued the conversation.

Fast-forward to now, she's no longer with that guy, they really didn't last long, and she's single again. But the thing is, despite still being friends with her (she's truly an amazing and genuine friend, she's been there for me through some hard times), I still feel like kind of betrayed and led on and honestly can't get it out of my head every time we hang out. 

What do you guys think, was she just friendly, or did she lead me on?

TL;DR Caught feelings for a friend, thought she reciprocated, but she found someone else not long after."	SparkeyGames	post	19.03504465038325	male	White	0.0033350903540849686	na	na	na	13	relationships
"Errrr.

  
Brother. This girl took you to a concert, told you she's attracted to you even though she was really shy, sweet talked with you for a month, cuddled you on a bench for hours. She's fighting for her damn life out here and you were STILL waiting for her to be the one to make the move? 

  
She can't do everything. If I made myself this clear to a man and he didn't ask me out, after two months, I'd assume he just wanted to be friends or was maybe asexual. 

&#x200B;

Why do you feel betrayed? She was clearly waiting for you to ask her out or express that you liked her how she liked you. After two months, someone else did.

I wasn't sure, still am not. I still think that she was just friendly, since a lot of guys are interested in her, and I don't think she would pick ME of all people.

Here's the thing: she literally said she was attracted to you. She cuddled you for four hours. She was fighting for her life trying to make it clear she liked you. At a point, you gotta meet someone where they're at or you miss your shot. 

It sounds like she just assumed you weren't into her after waiting for months and moved on. It might NOT be too late, if you wanna still pursue this.

For example a few days ago she told me about something that ""only people who she was really close with know about"", to which I responded with ""ah, i guess now it's your closest friends and me, because we're nowhere near really close lmao"".

"Hi everyone, I'm feeling very conflicted. Last night, my boyfriend finally brought up the fact that we have been arguing a lot lately. We agreed that we'll start going on more dates again, and that he'd start hearing me out more because I've just become a pushover when it comes to arguments, because I really really hate arguing. I kind of just give in too easily and admit defeat, which he dislikes, but doesn't exactly give me the space to fight back without shutting me down completely. I'd like to convince myself that this is a rough patch we can work through together. This is a relationship I want to fight for, because he means the world to me - but l'm not sure if it's something fixable or just how our natural dynamic will always be. We've had stupid arguments like this from the very beginning (we've been together for 10 months now). We have great banter and things are really good when they're good, but it seems like we can never escape even the tiniest argument to ruin the mood, even for just a few minutes. It usually just ends with me apologizing (he hates when I cry), even if it wasn't my fault in the first place. For context, it is both of our first times in a relationship, so of course it's hard when you're just learning about your wants and needs with another person. I just want to go one day without having another tiny argument. Even in the beginning, when we went on more dates, we'd argue often. It's been happening a lot more often recently. Do you think our compromise from last night would really help smooth things over? It’s a lot of miscommunication. Is this a fixable problem or just a difference in values and the way we view the world that keep clashing? We both want to make an effort, but I'm wondering if our fighting is just a lost cause. They're so stupid and it's like we can never see eye-to-eye on the most mundane things. He's very prideful and angsty, which I don't respond well to. It feels like we're both walking on eggshells til our next argument. But we love each other's company nonetheless in those times we aren't arguing. I feel really proud of the progress we've made in getting to know each other, and we definitely feel much closer and intimate than the beginning, but it's just this damn arguing that always seems to worm its way in when things are good. Is this really sustainable?

TL;DR Is our miscommunication/arguing fixable or a difference in values that can’t be helped? Rough patch or time to call it quits?"	pikachuteef	post	20.699373476045064	male	White	0.9985859394073486	na	na	na	5	relationships
"The beginning of a relationship is supposed to be the honeymoon period, where both people are so excited and thrilled to be with one another that they are both on their best behavior *and* are being extra tolerant, so that things go a little bit unrealistically well, at least for a time.

But you two:

> We've had stupid arguments like this from the very beginning

...never even had that.

> I just want to go one day without having another tiny argument. Even in the beginning, when we went on more dates, we'd argue often. 

What is there to *salvage* here?

You cannot date only the *good* parts of one another.  You cannot separate out the fact that you argue *every single day*.  You cannot sweep ten *months* of escalating arguments that began right from the very beginning.

The two of you *cannot* proceed in a healthy way, and no amount of ""but we love each other soooooooo much"" can change that fact.

Here's the thing:

People to exactly what they *want* to do.  Every single time.  They put their time, effort, and energy into those things that are most important to them, and they put less (or none) into things that are less (or not) important.

What's more, when we love someone (really *actually* love someone) their needs become as important to us as our own.

So.  Neither of you cares enough about the other and the other's needs to *even speak to one another respectfully*.  Where, then, is all of that ""love""?

If the two of you *wanted* to be respectful and caring toward one another, *you would be*.  But you're not.

And the *reason* you're not is because the two of you are coming at the relationship from exactly the wrong perspective.

Each of you is trying to *win* at the relationship.  When there's a disagreement, you see yourself needing to *win* against him, and he sees himself needing to win against *you*.  Both of you are putting your time, effort, and energy into *beating your partner*, instead of into *being* a partner.

Good, healthy, strong, balanced, workable long-lasting relationships do not begin with two people who are each trying to win against the other.  Because a relationship is not a competition; it's a *cooperation*.  The relationships that *work* are the ones where the two people team up *with* one another, as allies, to win against all of the challenges that life throws at them.

Neither of the two of you are in an emotionally-mature enough place to be in a healthy adult partnership.

Unless and until you each stop seeing one another as *adversaries* to fight against, there is no hope (none).

It's time to end this, because the cycle is too ingrained in *both* of your minds.  End it, walk away, and spend time figuring out why it is that you would want to be with a partner you have to compete *against*.  

And don't get into another relationship until you find yourself willing to team up with that person instead of seeing him as an adversary you have to beat."	pikachuteef	reply	na	na	na	0.9985859394073486	no	no	no	na	relationships

Definitely see where you’re coming from. Initially, I’d fight for myself a lot in arguments (perhaps that’s what caused more, since we’re both stubborn and never admit defeat), but it’d just turn into a cycle of us fighting, me saying “I don’t want to fight anymore”, and it getting pushed aside somehow.

"This is where effective communication is important. Arguments are not about who is defeated, they're negotiating how you can meet the other person's needs while meeting your own. It's a peace treaty, not a war.

"As stated in the question, I’m overthinking because me and my bf got an apartment together after dating 2 months. I’ve mentioned this on past posts, but reddit helps me and for background…my bf had been out of a relationship for 2 months before we started dating. The ex and him ended bad and long story short I know what happened and he left her without really any clarity or reason.  


He’s reassured me…and well we’re living together now. We both work minimum wage jobs and don’t have plans to go to school or anything rn. Honestly, I’ve asked friends and family if they have known anyone who they know of anyone who’s moved out with their s/o after only 2 months and everyone has said no. The people who have said they have known people who have moved out fast said it didn’t last but how often is this? 


I also had asked a question before about if people who get a tattoo of their s/o name or initials end up breaking up and there were a lot of people saying yes. It’s too late now but I did get a tattoo of my bfs car and initials like after a month or so but I think I’m just looking for someone’s advice on what to do in this situation because I’m overthinking and I know I’m in this situation now but I do love him.

"Let me put it this way. Moving in after only 2 months is taking a gamble that you two can feel comfortable sharing your private lives with each other, including the mundane and unflattering sides, including your expectations on house maintenance, communication, and privacy.

And it not only locks you into a commitment that lasts however long your lease does, but it ALSO sacrifices all privacy and security of having your own dedicated personal space away from your partner.

*Maybe* you two are compatible, and *maybe* you two are able to work through your inevitable differences in a way that's civil and peaceful. But a safer way to find that out with minimal risk would be spending time together in a non-domestic setting where you have the safety and security of a private household to fall back on.

As far as practical advice goes, I'd say if you're already locked into a living situation with him for however many months your lease requires, make sure you have the ability to safely leave an intimate relationship and become roommates. I'm not saying that as a matter of ""I doubt your relationship will work"", I'm saying ""EVERY person in a relationship should have the freedom to leave at any time."" Healthy relationships can only work when both people have the freedom to leave if they recognize that the relationship no longer works for them. If you're ever under pressure to remain in a relationship because of living circumstances, that's not love."	chickenbangs	reply	na	na	na	0.9934971332550049	no	no	no	na	relationships
"I mean he has his ex blocked. I would assume I’m sure she has seen my profile which is public. I know she has actually. So I’m sure she’s seen all my stuff on my profile. As for his, his profile is also public but he has her blocked.

Even though she’s blocked, I’m sure she has been able to find a way to see his profile. This is also why I don’t understand why he even wanted to prank call her being that he has her blocked on everything? That’s why it made me feel odd because they haven’t had any communication and on our first weekend in the apartment he wanted to prank call her. I also want to mention I had a post pop up on my fyp on Instagram that he liked that was about missing/thinking about his ex.

On top of that, I didn’t tell him or mention it but I had seen he liked a post on Instagram that popped up on my fyp about basically missing/thinking about an ex. I just saw he was under the likes and of course it made me sad but I don’t know what to think of it. He says he loves me and reassured me but idk.

I also am gonna be straight up and honest that a little over a month ago I followed his ex on tik tok. Ik it sounds bad but I did and I knew she’d see certain videos I made of him and I wanted her to see it. I know it sounds kinda messed up considering I know she wasn’t the one who hurt him or at fault for their breakup but I think I did it probably out of insecurity.

"I do understand it was childish and petty and I realize this. I do understand.

The prank call like I said did make me feel weird because I don’t know why he’d want to considering how badly it ended and he hasn’t wanted any communication with her. It was like an automated prank call website he used so I don’t know. It doesn’t make a difference but yeah.

And the reason they broke up was because long story short I guess they both were on a FaceTime call with my bfs cousin and they were just talking and all of a sudden my bf got angry at her and accused her of cheating and said she said stuff she never said but he was there on the call the whole time. He basically just gaslit her and made up stuff that didn’t happen and wanted her to admit to whatever it was he said. The cousin had confronted him about it multiple times and my bf did kind of admit it in his own way but didn’t take really any accountability or ever tell his ex that or gave her an explanation or anything. He just kind of blocked her and left. I also know the day after he did that he asked her to be friends and she said no because she wanted to be with him and he said no. 

Bottom line, he just made up stuff that she didn’t say and accused her of flirting and cheating on him during a FaceTime call he was on with his cousin. She was very hurt and confused and didn’t understand why my bf was doing all this. 2 months after they broke up is when we started dating."	chickenbangs	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9934971332550049	weak	strong	no	na	relationships

"
My partner and I Have been dating for a little over four years. We met at a very young age but now have changed into new people with our own different personalities. It is also good to note that I have been diagnosed with BPD (Borderline personality disorder) recently.

For the safety reasons let’s call him Bob. 

I have been having issues with Bob since three years now about how he fails to show how much he loves me through his actions. He never plans any dates, fails to show respect in ways like not defending me when his friends insulted me or have done something wrong to me. He never acknowledges the sacrifices I make for him, e.g- going against my parents to see him, spending all my money on him since he is jobless for very long time and doesn’t even try and find a job. He says he loves me and cares about me but doesn’t show it enough.

Last night, I caught him looking at other girls on social media and he NEVER does that. I accidentally caught him and when confronted he lied and denied. After coming home, I texted and confronted him again. He told me there’s nothing wrong with that and that it was a one time thing and how I am making it a big deal when its not. He also stopped complimenting me and kissing me since a very long time and I was really hurt when it all hit. He never even looked at other girls before this. I asked my bsf(19F) if i’m overreacting and she said my feelings are valid and how it is a boundary that he crossed. 

It is also worth noting that we nearly broke up a week ago because of how bland the relationship has become, and how he doesn’t even try to keep me in it. He constantly brings me down like that and always expects me to stay quiet and forget about it. Every time I tried to communicate with him, he always assumed I just want to argue.

Tl;Dr- I’m genuinely tired. I love him with all my heart but I can’t do this to myself any longer. Fours is a long time. His family absolutely adores me. His mum is an angel but I don’t know what to do in this situation. Ik he loves me with all his heart but he’s not IN love with me anymore. Our intimacy life is also very bad, there is no spark and he has started to be anxious during it since a year which makes him not want to do it anymore.  I just want love and respect. He has failed to respect me over and over and over again.  I’m scared no one will love me anymore if i let him go. We had an amazing relationship when we didn’t argue but I don’t think he loves me enough to change his actions. I don’t know whether I should break up or not."

"Whether or not you should leave him because he looked at another girl online is immaterial.

You should *already* have left him, long ago, because of:

...all of *this*.

For a relationship to be healthy and workable in the long run, it must be *balanced*.  Balance means that both people in the relationship are contributing to it *equitably*, such that both people are getting enough *out* of the relationship (in terms of satisfaction, comfort, security, emotional well-being, joy, and so forth) to make what they are putting *into* it (in terms of time, effort, emotional energy, and money) worth their while.

For *three years* out of a four-year relationship, you have *not* been getting enough out of the relationship to make what you are putting into it worth your while.

Why are you clinging to this relationship in the first place?  In what way has the relationship made your life *better* these past three years?  

> It is also worth noting that we nearly broke up a week ago because of how bland the relationship has become, and how he doesn’t even try to keep me in it. He constantly brings me down like that and always expects me to stay quiet and forget about it. Every time I tried to communicate with him, he always assumed I just want to argue.

What possible reason could there be to try to *save* this?

And, no, this:

> I love him with all my heart 

is not a valid reason.  It's possible to love all *kinds* of toxic, abusive, manipulative, and self-serving people.  

Is this relationship making your life *better*?

"When I (16f) was born, my mom had ppd, and she neglected me a lot. Her health deteriorated and she tried to kill herself, after that she lived far from me and my dad. My dad divorced her and met Mary(38) when I was 5 years old. I do not remember my life with my mom, and I do not know anything about her except that she abandoned me and didn't communicate with me or send me gifts, unlike Mary, Mary loved me as her own daughter, and although Mary and my dad had a son, Mary never treated me differently. 

Almost a year ago, my dad and Mary told me that my mom had contacted them and wanted to build a relationship with me. I was hesitant, but after thinking I decided to meet her, Mary opened her house to my mom and encouraged me to invited her to school events .... etc. Everything was going well until the previous month my dad and Mary had a huge argument and Mary left the house with my brother Mary did not tell me what happened and my dad refused to talk to me and told me that their relationship is over. 

last week My dad told me that him and my mom wanted to talk to me about something important. They sat me down and told me that they would be back together. I was surprised and did not say anything. After they finished talking, I went to my room where I stayed until this day. I do not want my dad and mom to come back together. I want Mary to come home, I know I sound dramatic but the house without Mary feels empty ,I want to go live with her but I don't know how to tell Mom and Dad this, what should I do?

Is my English bad and no one can understand me or my situation is hopeless and no one have any advice?💔

TL;DR: my parents want to get back together and I don't want this, I want to live with my dad ex gf because I feel she is my mom and my safe with her"	Delicious-Light5364	post	21.84740686770456	female	Hispanic	0.012353709898889065	na	na	na	17	relationships
"I don’t think this is an issue you should try to solve by talking directly with your father. Family therapists can act as mediators, help you to figure out what you want to say, and more importantly can help parents to listen to their kids. Telling your father you want to live with your chosen mother will be hard for him to hear. Instead, tell him that you are just having trouble adjusting and ask if you could meet with a family therapist together. I expect the opportunity would come up there for you to say this, and a bunch of other stuff.

If you feel uncomfortable making this suggestion to your father directly you could ask a trusted adult to bring it up.

"I can understand your attachment to Mary, this is a woman who loved and cared for you for most of your life. 

So last month your dad and Mary split up, did neither one of them tell you what happened? Why the sudden split? I think that’s an important thing for you to know. You’re 16, we’ll old enough to understand. 
Have you spoken to Mary at all? You must have her cell number. Call her and ask. She may be the only one who will tell you the truth. You can tell her you want to stay in touch, you dont want to lose her from your life, you want to be in your brothers life. 
(My guess is dad cheated on Mary with your mom, that’s really the only thing that would make me leave.)

I would suggest that you explain to both your parents that you are wary of them getting back together. Is your mom mentally stable? I’m going to say yes, since ppd shouldn’t last forever if she got help. 
Tell them you want to have visits with Mary, she’s your parent in your eyes too and see what they say. 
Actually, spin it as they can have time alone to get reacquainted with each other. 

This sucks for you. You feel like you’re stuck with no say in what happens, but if you don’t ask for what you want you’re guaranteed to not get it.

Are you still in contact with Mary? Before you tell your parents what you want, I would make sure that you and Mary are on the same page. There might be financial barriers or other considerations that could prevent you from living with her. Even if you aren't able to move in with her, there might be other ways to get the love and connection you need from her.

Once you have a better idea of your options, write down all of the reasons why you want to live with Mary before going to your parents. If they turn it into an argument, it helps to have a list so that you can redirect them to the full list of your concerns. 

Be prepared with some compromises. If they are not willing to budge on a full move, maybe there is a shared situation that would work. 

If nothing else, remember that you are very close to adulthood and being able to make these choices for yourself. Two years seems like forever, but it is sooner than you think."	Delicious-Light5364	reply	na	na	na	0.012353709898889065	strong	no	strong	na	relationships
"What I'm going to say sucks and you aren't going to want to hear it. 16 is a rough age because you feel like a full adult, you have more responsibilities and more understanding of the problems the adults in your life are going through. At the same time, you still have people making decisions that impact you and you have no real say. I think it's better for you to have the reality of your situation presented to you so that you can process your emotions and come to terms with the changes in your life. Hearing ""you'll understand when you're older"" is wack because there are choices my parents made when I was a kid that are bonkers. But! You will have more appreciation for how difficult the situation is for all three adults in your life.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, it is unlikely that you'll be able to live full time with Mary, if at all. She isn't your legal guardian and has no claim to physical custody (who you live with) nor legal custody (who makes decisions for you like your school, medical stuff, etc). In cases where a couple breaks up and both parties have full custody (such as being the biological parent, a legal guardian, or an adopted parent), they can either come to an agreement together or go through the court process to have it decided based on the best interest of the minor child. Depending on how the divorce between your dad and biological mom went, your dad might have full custody or your mom might still have parental rights in the eyes of the law. It is possible that your dad could allow you to live with Mary full or part time. But at the end of the day, it's his choice.

&nbsp;

I recommend: asking your dad for help getting a therapist so that you have someone to help you process everything with. I would also see if he and your mom would be open to family therapy, especially as you all transition into living together for the first time in 15 years. A therapist will also be able to meditate discussing your want to live with Mary with your parents. I would ask Mary if you can meet up for coffee or a walk or something that you like doing together. This is also a huge change for her as her partner of 11 years just left her. She's adjusting to living on her own and being a single mom to your brother. You also might not know if she is able to support another person in her current situation. Go to Zillow and look up rent prices in your area for a 3 bedroom. Check out how much Internet, water, and other utilities cost. Find the average wages for your area and see how much you'd have left for food, gas, and other things you need throughout the month. It's not always as simple as we'd like. She might want to be able to have you live with her, but not be able to realistically make it work. It doesn't mean that she loves you less, it means that she doesn't think it would be the best option for you and your brother.

&nbsp;

A couple things to keep in mind: 1) it sounds like everyone loves you and wants the best for you. Even if you don't agree with those choices, they likely believe that it is the best option. They're trying their best. Which leads me to 2) Adults are just guessing at what they're doing. The older you get, the better you can get at guessing the best choice. But there isn't a game plan to follow for when you have a newborn and your partner is mentally ill. There isn't a guide for when that partner reenters your life after years apart. You just have to do your best. Sometimes you get it wrong. Sometimes doing the right thing seems like the wrong thing or hurts someone. And while the road to hell is paved with good intentions, I find keeping this in mind allows me to not waste as much energy on being angry and instead focus on making my current situation better.

&nbsp;

You got two more years before you can go out and live where you want and pay bills! It'll go by quicker than you think regardless of where you live! Good luck!

"I'm very sorry this has all happened to you.

It's unlikely that even if your parents were willing, you could go live with Mary. There's a lot of legal stuff that would make that difficult if she's not your legal guardian. But if you want to pursue it, the first step is to talk to Mary, not your parents. She might not be able to take you in, even though she loves you, and if that's true, there's no reason to make your family life harder by letting your parents know you tried to leave.

If she *is* willing and able, she probably needs time to talk to lawyers and figure out finances and school and etc. before anything moves ahead, and then *she* might be the better person to talk to your parents about the possibility of becoming your legal guardian.  If you rush ahead without her you could make things harder for both of you.

Talk to Mary first. Be prepared to hear that even though she loves you she might not be in a place to be your full time parent right now. If you do end up needing to stay with your dad, try to hang in there - you're really close to being old enough to move out and maybe Mary or another family member can help you with that when you're 18, even if they can't take you in now."

"Sure, but compare that to how often kids get in trouble for trying to share their feelings with their parents at home, in regular conversation. Shouting matches and tears and quick reactions, all that mess.

I personally had a fair amount of family therapy focused around my folks splitting up and other issues with mine and my siblings behavior. The things that you say in therapy are the same things you want to say to your parent in general, only there is a 3rd party, the therapist, who is there to make sure you have support in what you’re trying to communicate and that your parents listen, instead of just reacting.

I'm just guessing here, but perhaps your Dad was falling for your birth Mom with her being present and decided to break up with Mary.  Mary might not want to be the one to explain that to you because she doesn’t want to hurt your relationship with you father.

Please tell her! Even if it can't happen right now for legal or logistical reasons, it will warm her heart to know how much you love and miss her.

It depends if she adopted you I think. At 16 you may have some say and I think it’s fair to seek advice from an outside adult, see if a counsellor at school can connect your with someone well versed in family law. At minimum stay in contact with Mary and once you are 18 you can move if that is what both of you want.	Delicious-Light5364	reply	na	na	na	0.012353709898889065	weak	no	no	na	relationships
"Most aspects of law isn't really concerned with fairness, or at least how we think about fairness. And, not to be cliche, but life isn't often fair.

&nbsp;

When someone has a biological child the law instantly recognizes that they have parental rights and responsibilities. A biological parent, under certain circumstances, can give up those rights or a court can terminate those rights. When someone adopts or is given guardianship of a child, the legal system is acknowledging that the person now has rights and responsibilities for the care of the child. It depends on your local laws, but generally even if your dad and Mary had gotten married or had a civil union Mary would still have had to go through the adoption process to gain those rights and responsibilities. And before that, your biological mom would have had to either voluntarily terminated her parental rights or had them terminated through the court.

&nbsp;

Essentially, your parent(s) have rights to raise you as they see fit and responsibilities for the level of care you receive. In most cases, it is up to them to decide to share those rights and responsibilities and go through the official processes. Your dad, for whatever reason, did not go through the official processes and chose not to share his parental rights with Mary. There are an infinite reasons why someone does or doesn't do something. It's really not going to be helpful to dwell on the why's and why nots."	Delicious-Light5364	reply	na	na	na	0.012353709898889065	no	no	no	na	relationships

"I have known both my friend, let's call her Tara, and her younger sister, let's call her Kasey, for over a decade now.

However, Kasey has always been spiteful and mean towards most people, including me. So I shied away from ever getting too close to her. Meanwhile, Tara and I stayed good friends.

Unfortunately, just naturally due to being close to Tara, and Tara hanging out with her sister often, I have met Kasey throughout the years.

Around 5 years back, I had enough of Kasey's mean-spirited behavior, and decided to avoid meeting her. Tara knows that Kasey is mean-spirited, but also thinks her sister is very sweet(?). So I'm not sure what to think about that, but because of it, I never talked to Tara about avoiding Kasey. I just continued to reject any opportunities that would mean I would be near Kasey.

Recently, long story short, I met Kasey again due to Tara. One of the first things she asked me is if I got a nose job. I did not, I simply lost a large amount of weight in 5 years.

I felt it was rude for Kasey to ask me that, but didn't think much of it.

My mistake was that I thought Kasey had changed within the last 5 years, as besides the rude nose job question, she was very sweet and I was very surprised. So when she asked me to go to a bar with her sister the next week, I accepted.

The next week comes, and it turns out Kasey's friend, let's call her Jan, also was joining us. I've never met her, but almost the minute I sit down, Jan excessively compliments my nose. Jan then asks me if my nose is fake. I deny it, but I feel extremely awkward because I could tell what happened exactly, which is.. because I know Kasey, she definitely asked Jan to comment on my nose to see my reaction. Plus Jan is a terrible actress, and was being really obvious about making my nose a point.

Jan then later makes another comment about how perfect my nose is, out of nowhere. I feel very uncomfortable again.

Then when we're all home, Kasey texts me saying how she knows it's fake, but that i keep saying it's real. But that it's definitely fake.

What makes me sad is that I never ended up defending myself, in person and through text. Hindsight I wish I said something to the effect of, this is a very intrusive question. Or point out that I know what they're doing. But I felt ridiculed and upset and powerless for some reason. I think it's because I know if I upset Kasey, she'll blow up and it'll make things worse for me.

I was also sad that my friend, Tara, never stepped in. In fact, I felt like she found it humorous. I know that she knows exactly what was happening, too. I know this because Tara has expressed to me the way Kasey thinks, and how Kasey does these mean-spirited things.

But am I in the right to be sad that Tara never stood up for me, or told them to knock it off?

I never want to speak or see Kasey or her friend again. Should I have a conversation with Tara about how I feel, or should I also just never speak or see her again as well?

You may say I should talk to Kasey or confront her, but that would make this problem worse. Kasey isn't someone one can reason with, I'm way better off avoiding her.

But with Tara, I always considered her a good friend of mine. We've been very close for the last 10 years. I know that if my sister was acting this way to my friend, I would tell her to knock it off.

you could be the world’s most perfect person, and somebody will need - or want to - vent about you.


in saying that she vents to her sister about you says nothing about you necessarily -

TL;DR: GF gets mad at me for making her feel anxious by asking her certain questions or acting nervous. She says it makes her feel bad when she’s feeling good. I’m not sure how to communicate with her especially when she gets heated/ raises her voice 

I need a little advice on how to approach certain situations with my girlfriend. She seems to get really agitated at the smallest things. 
Tonight, I came home from work late and she made some soup for me to eat. We’re staying at a friends house because my apartment doesn’t open up until later this week.  I was really excited to see her and eat what she made for me. When I come in, she asks me if I want to shower and I said yes. She said she’ll prepare the food while I shower. I kissed her and gave her a hug then went to shower. After I got out she put it on the kitchen counter. She was watching a movie in the living room with a friend but I was nervous about eating in the living room because it’s not my place and I know some people are particular about where to eat in their house. I wanted to join her and her friend though so I asked her if it’s okay to eat in the living room. She responded with a kind of aggressive “what do you think?” 
Since she didn’t answer I started eating alone in the kitchen but then I just decided to say fuck it and eat in the living room.

As they’re watching a movie halfway though, she tells me if I want to lie down in the room I don’t have to watch the movie with them. So I decided to watch my own thing in the room and thanked her for the meal. She then comes in and says how frustrated she is with me for making her feel “anxious and uncomfortable” since I was anxious / nervous about where I was gonna eat. She said she was feeling great and then I came in and made her feel uncomfortable. At this point she’s pretty upset, and is making it seem like I ruined her night for asking her that.. she says she wants to communicate with me but I already told her I was just nervous about where I was gonna eat and that’s it. I don’t think it’s a big deal and for her to blame me for making her feel uncomfortable just seems wild to me. She was pretty heated and raising her voice, telling me that even laying next to her is making her uncomfortable so I told her I love her but I’m leaving, left and took a drive. She says cause I can’t communicate that she doesn’t want to talk to me all day tomorrow nor does she want to be around me.
I’m so confused on how to handle this or how I can repair things with her.. any advice?"	Plane-Jackfruit7161	post	21.408418296295174	female	White	0.99819415807724	na	na	na	0	relationships

**TL;DR:** Met in university, 7-year relationship, started as friends, later had a complicated situation with best friend, became intimate, now facing insecurities and past issues, seeking advice on how to handle it.

Hey Reddit, I (F25) want to share my story about a relationship that began 7 years ago during our first year of university. At 18, I met my partner (M27), and we hit it off instantly. Back then, we formed a close-knit group of friends that included my best friend (F19) from high school. However, things took an unexpected turn when my best friend confessed her interest in my partner during a night out.

During our initial outings, my partner and I discovered a shared interest in a different style of clubbing, but my best friend's confession abruptly interrupted our conversation. Wanting to give her a chance, I swapped seats with her, feeling a hint of awkwardness as I sensed a connection between my partner and me. Despite the fleeting moment, I cherished my friendship with my best friend and brushed aside any thoughts of pursuing a romantic connection.

Time went on, and my partner and I continued to bond, spending countless hours together and forming a strong friendship. Eventually, circumstances led to a night of intimacy between us, which left me conflicted due to my best friend's lingering feelings. While I knew I had hurt her, she had previously expressed uncertainty about pursuing a committed relationship with my partner.

A week after our intimate encounter, I confessed to my best friend, triggering her anger and accusations of betrayal. Overwhelmed by guilt, I distanced myself from the group, only to join them on a trip later on. During the trip, my best friend and my partner shared a passionate kiss, which surprised and unsettled me. I confronted them and unexpectedly found myself revealing my own feelings for my partner.

My best friend offered to step back if I wanted a chance with him, but I declined, admitting my emotions but allowing her to make her own choices. This led to my partner and me growing closer, eventually leading to a committed relationship. However, over time, doubts and insecurities resurfaced, fueled by a fear of being a second choice. 

Recently, I confronted my partner about these feelings, concerned that past events still affected us. While the conversation helped clear some misunderstandings, I worry that I may have mishandled the situation and made things worse.

"Yesterday I told him that I consider breaking up with him because of me feeling that way all these years. Unintentionally, It happened just before we were planning to go to a dinner with his parents.. he went without me. 
 After he came back he tried to explain to me his view of the situation that happened with my best friend and it’s very different from what I remember so I told him that I actually think he’s not honest with me about it. For example one time my best friend shared with me that he came to our dorm and told her that he has feelings and kissed her, but he is saying that never happened. 
At the end I apologised and told him that I trust him  and chose to believe that the truth is something in between. Later that day we had sex together and I felt it different and awkward somehow.
This morning he went to work without waking me up. He usually wakes me up every morning to have 5 minutes coffee time and kisses me goodbye but this morning he didn’t say goodbye even."	One_Professional_617	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0021790910977870226	no	strong	no	na	relationships

"If anyone reads this or responds I’ll try my best to reply to any questions.

Hi, this is my first ever Reddit post, so please bear with me. I am just looking for an outside look to see what others think, sorry if it’s all over the place, but I’m just trying to summarise everything that happened.

I was talking with this girl (f20), and I am (m20), and we instantly clicked, and our personalities and views matched. The only thing is that she came out of two toxic relationships, the most recent one being two months ago. She likes to go out, and I'm more of a stay-at-home person, but I even went out of my way to go out to places I’ve never been to make her happy because I thought I had a future with her and wanted to see her happy and try change for her.

She told me I brought out her ""inner child"" and she felt so happy with me and how I treated her, she felt so ""loved"", I never yelled at her, put her down, or did anything of the sort that I think she experienced in her last relationships.

To start things off, we didn’t have any issues at the start; we were peaceful and civil, and we established our dos and don’ts and how we both view relationships, we both agreed communication was the most important thing, and we stuck to it.

Firstly on of the main issue is that she kissed her best friend at her party (f) and hid it from me because she was scared of how I’d react, and I acted like it was fine when it wasn’t because I really did love her, saw a future with her, and was willing to put it aside and forgive her.

Secondly, she wouldn’t listen to me to remove guys off her social media (snap) who were trying to get her to come over and obviously do things with her(apparently she had a phase). She eventually did, but it took a bit for her to even acknowledge and see what I was talking about. I’m not sure if they ever did things, but the things they were asking for pointed towards it.

I then told her I didn’t want her to go clubbing because 90% of times people go clubbing for a quick hookup with no strings attached, and she was going with all her single friends. She’s not going to sit there while they are hooking up and talking to guys. She even agreed to the points I was making. We then talked about it, and we came to the conclusion that it was fine because I really did trust her (I didn't want to go because the nightlife isn't for me and I don't drink, which I did say before we started getting deeper into our relationship).

Now coming to Sunday, we had an argument that I thought we could resolve, but nope, she didn’t even want to call me to try sorting it out, she just said she was feeling tied down and didn’t want to even talk to me anymore or want to continue building a relationship with me. She also said she met my family too fast when she wanted to come over, and I even told her they would be here, and she said it was okay and she even wanted to add my sister on snap.

I just feel like I was used for comfort and fed lies to keep me from losing interest. I had to always hear about everything her exs did, and she would always mention them no matter what even if we where having a moment to ourselves. I just feel so used and dumb for falling for it because I really did like her.

"you made a lot of requests of her over a short period of time. It became a cage, she decided she felt trapped.

It is not about how reasonable or rational your requests may have been. She was asked to change her life and her lifestyle, to go from being in one phase of life to another, while you did not have that pressure placed on you.

 We cannot ask people to make changes and expect them to be compliant; there will be resentment.

She’s traumatised. She needs to seek out some therapy. Don’t think you can fix her, because you can’t. I’ve been there, done that and have the BPD to prove it.

"Earlier today, before I left, the owner of the company I work for was near my desk, talking to two other coworkers, both guys. He was talking about some kind of trade show thing he was interested in, but I guess the person he was supposed to go with had backed out, he was like ""and now I got nobody to go with me"" and made like a joking sad face, and without thinking, I said ""I'd go with you"", which was meant to be innocent and friendly, but the way it came out, the intonation of it, sounded weirdly flirtatious or devious or something. 

I have a hard time with small talk and because I'm nervous already since everyone thinks the owner is a big deal around here and sucks up like crazy, it's 10x worse with him. I should have kept my mouth shut but nervousness also makes me blurt stuff out too, and half the time it winds up being something embarrassing or out of place just like here.

The owner looked over at me with a weird half smiling type of look on his face while the other two guys were being silly (pretty much just jokingly raising their eyebrows about it), and I started babbling like an idiot, trying to find a way to smooth it over like oh sorry, that sounded kind of weird, I just meant it seems like fun etc etc. 

To add some more context, my boss isn't some slick, schmoozy rich old guy. He's dorky and super awkward to talk to, and based on his expression after I said it, and just how he acted afterward in general, I suspect he had some epiphany in that he now thinks I like him *like that*, as in, romantically. You could 100% tell the gears were turning in there, it was obvious, I don't want to seem like I assume every guy wants me but it was pretty hard to dismiss as presumption. So it's not that I'm concerned about getting fired or getting into trouble here, nothing like that. I'm worried I gave him the wrong idea and will have to deal with it in the near future. 

So now I'm just waiting, like a sitting duck for him to approach me in some cringingly stilted conversation wherein I will have to somehow correct this misunderstanding while not harming his ego. 

I do like the guy, in spite of what I said about him, he's really sweet and he's funny, looks wise he's not bad looking for his age, so it's not like I find him ugly or repulsive at all, but he is my boss. Also, I just want to say that I don't intend to be cruel by how I describe him, he's just got a nerdy personality, it's a fact and I'm not sure how to better explain it. It's like the grown up version of the classic socially awkward little kid that collects model trains and hobby stuff and gets overly excited about those types of subjects.  

I managed to get out of there without encountering him again. Hopefully he will be too shy to ever say anything and this will just blow over but with my luck I'm not counting on it. He looked like some kid who just realized there was a big pile of candy in front of him or something. Should I preemptively send him an email? Or is that totally overreacting? And if he does ask me to go, or makes some other move, what the hell do I say?? The thing is, had my sentence come out as intended and he'd invited me in a platonic manner I would have gone because it actually did sound fun. But now, after I fucked up like that, I have no idea what he would be expecting if he asked me to go.

I wasn't trying to criticize you, but it's a legitimate problem when you get anxious that you ramble.

"My boyfriend (24m) and I (23f) had a rough relationship. We are two broken people with extremely hard childhoods, but we have always been holding on to each other out of strong love. We've been a couple for almost 4 years, we also live together. We had a breakup 6 months ago which I don't really want to talk about rn. That breakup was a turning point for the both of us. We became self-aware, working on ourselves, the way we talk to each other, the way we handle things, and we fixed our sex-life to a level where it is literally perfect. I found out a few months ago that he wanted to propose after our 1 year anniversary, so yesterday I joked about how he changed his mind. He was staring at the wall, not saying anything. He is not a serious person, so I got scared and began pushing for an answer. He asked me, ""do you think this is a stable relationship?"". I just could not say a thing, I got up and he came after me, saying that he didn't want us to argue in 20 years from now. I told him that he has stated he will propose in a year, and that he knew how marriage is the reason I am in a relationship, and now he just said he does not want to propose? He then replied by saying, he does want to propose, he just wants us to work on these arguements before he does, because this is not the way he wants it - which literally means it is not guaranteed that we will have an engagement. He tried to calm me down, and tell me that it is guaranteed, just let us fix it. For me, an engagement means that you trust your partner that they will grow with you, and they will change for the better, so you stick togehter and work on it as a team. And it feels like he does not trust me. I know I had been a handful of a person, but I worked so so hard to became better, and I feel like this is still not enough to see a sure future with me. I tried talking to him about how those arguements depend completely on him , because I changed my tone, my wording, I remain relaxed and respectful. It's just when I tell him he did something not so favorable, he rather tries to explain how he didn't mean it that way, instead of saying ""Im sorry, Ill do it differently next time, didn't mean to hurt you"". I do see his change, but that is still not enough to admit his mistakes. I've truly been feeling like we became a power couple, with respect, care, love, good conversations, great sex, etc. Yet, still not enough and I am not sure it will ever be. I don't know what I should do. I feel distant, like I am not even in a relationship anymore. Like, why should I put energy into this relationship if it is not even sure I will get married to him. I truly love him and felt like we were going on the right path, now I need advice on what I should do.

"Honestly, I don't think you're ready to be married.


If he's not comfortable *at the current time*, you can't morally push him towards it. If you do, he *will* end up resenting you for it, and that's not the basis for a strong relationship.


There's no guarantee you'll never fight, but obviously he has some reservations about the frequency or severity of the arguments you currently have. Marriage is not the be-all end-all of a relationship either. It seems to me like you just want to be a ""wife"" instead of a ""girlfriend""


You two ended a 4 year relationship 6 months ago, and now, all of a sudden, you think the relationship is ready to take the biggest step? No way.

tl;dr, a difference in religion between me (16m) and my girlfriend (16f) is causing me to worry a lot and i would like some input/advice. i am muslim and my girlfriend is christian and i am worried that if we have kids in the future, they won’t turn out muslim. 

first of all, i know that i am looking too far into the future, but I tend to do that with all things, and i overthink and worry about the future a lot.

i (16m) am muslim and i have been dating my girlfriend (16F) for 6 months now. it is against my religion to date, but i still did it anyways. 



my girlfriend is my best friend, she is the only person that i can be fully myself around, i talk to her about everything, and she makes me so happy, and i love her so much. she is very sweet and kind and very pretty. my girlfriend doesn’t really believe in god or religion, but she is going to start going to church soon. 

recently, for around a week or so, i have become very worried due to the difference in our religious beliefs. in my religion, dating is prohibited. muslim men are allowed to marry muslim, christian, or jewish women, but it is not recommended to marry a christian/jewish woman. also, when marrying a christian/jewish woman, islam and the quran allows it “on the condition that the children are raised as muslims”.

we often talk about the future (getting married and having kids, etc.) together, and i am starting to get worried about how the religious differences will affect us, mainly if we were to have kids together. she says she has no problem with me raising our kids to be muslim. despite this, i am worried about if my wife is a non-muslim, will my kids turn out non-muslim?

i worry about this because i don’t want to be sinful for my kids being non-muslim and it being my fault. i know it sounds quite hypocritical because my whole relationship is prohibited and sinful, but it is what it is.

there are a lot of points that make me debate this. for example, i wouldn’t be as religious as i am right now if i did not move to a muslim country when i was 12. 

also, despite my parents both being muslim and raising me and my brothers as muslim, my older brother is not muslim, which i believe is mainly due to his friends being predominantly non-muslim, while my friend group has been mainly muslim since i moved to the muslim country i am in now. so essentially, even if both parents are muslim, it’s still very possible that the kids could turn out non-muslim anyways.

additionally, these worries that i’m having right now are mainly being influenced by other people. i just came back from a vacation with my family and obviously spent a lot of time with them during the vacation, which was a lot more time than i spend with them regularly, so i got closer with my family and my parents (we are all muslim except for my older brother).

moreover, recently my mom has been talking about a male relative who wants to marry a woman who is “muslim but not practicing”, and my mom went on a rant about it when me and her were in the car alone together, saying things like “if you have a daughter and the mother is not covering herself, of course the daughter won’t turn out muslim” and other similar things. 

finally, i feel like i can’t really trust the way i’m thinking right now. for the past 2 months i’ve been having some mood-related issues, internal issues i guess is what you can call it. i’ve had a lot of suicidal thoughts and self-harm thoughts, my mood has been quite bad for the past few months, i don’t enjoy a lot of things, my self-confidence is quite low, etc. it sounds dramatic but she is one of the only things that is keeping me going rig

also, i have been doing long distance with my girlfriend for thee 2 months and haven’t seen her since and will see her for the first time in a week, so i wonder if the long-distance is affecting my views on her and the relationship. 

i am also not even that religious myself. about a year ago i was pretty religious and in the last year i’ve not been that focused on it. plus the whole relationship is against my religion anyways.

i know it is very far in the future, but please provide me with some solutions or something to help me stop worrying about it. if it were not for the difference in religion, i would have no worries about my relationship. my girlfriend is an amazing person and she always pushes me to be my best, and she can instantly change my mood to the better as soon as i’m with her. 

i really don’t want this to be the cause of us breaking up, i don’t think breaking up would solve anything. if we were to break up, i would probably hate myself and become very guilty and end up regretting it, and my mood would just become even worse. plus, in the past when we first started dating (november-december), she broke up with me for an unrelated reason and in the months when we weren’t together and before we got back together, i was suicidal and my life was pretty shit. 

even though we have cultural differences and my parents wouldn’t really want me to get married to someone with a different religion and cultural background, this is not really the point that worries me, it’s mainly about my future kids and me being sinful for my kids not being muslims, but i would try my best to raise them as muslims.

any help would be greatly appreciated."	octillionairegrind	post	23.128901179791733	male	White	0.0037541009951382875	na	na	na	2	relationships
"Okay so the answer here really is that you're too young to be worrying about this. You cant stress out about something that might cause a breakup in 5 years. Anything could happen in the meantime. You could grow apart as you go away for college and break up for totally unrelated reasons. You could decide as an adult that actually, faith is not that important to you and your kids can be good people even if they choose a different religion.

"This was technically a past situation that ended not too long ago (just a few months ago), but I've (28f) been struggling a lot with feeling like it was weird and inappropriate for me to be attracted to a (now former) coworker (22m) of mine (to be clear, these were the ages we met at).  
We were both waiters at the same restaurant, and started at the same time, so we formed a pretty natural friendship. It was clear he was into me and trying to lay the foundation for a possible hookup/fwb/romance situation later, and at first I was definitely not interested, but the friendship escalated to flirting and eventually I ""caught the vibe"" and started to reciprocate interest. Nothing besides a kiss ever happened, but the whole situation kind of blew up for a lot of different reasons, and now we're not friends anymore and he left for a different job (not because of the relationship, he'd been trying to get this new job for a long time).  
I don't think I've ever been interested in someone younger than me--and usually I have a pretty intense radar about people preying on younger adults (I was involved in a really toxic age gap relationship when I was 21-25 ish, with someone 24 years my senior). I usually see people 4 years younger than me as kids, etc. But with my coworker it was different, largely I think because he was a more experienced server than me and honestly because for awhile he was my first and only friend at this job. I felt weirdly comfortable and ""safe"" with him, given the job's toxic environment.  
All this is to say, was this inappropriate on my behalf? The romance is over, but I've been feeling a lot of guilt and just want more thoughts on if I need a deeper look into my behavior.

I don’t think so. You’re attracted to who you’re attracted to. And it’s not like he was a child or anything. 22 is old enough to know what you want in a partner	Ok_Marionberry_8077	reply	na	na	na	0.9907440543174744	no	no	no	na	relationships
'creepy' is objective, but the two main things that would make something a predatory and inappropriate situation are 1) one of the parties is a teenager/ not a legal adult 2) the older person is in a position of power- supervises them at work, mentor in the field, coach etc. Neither of those are the case here, and coupled with the fact that all that happened was a kiss, I don't think you did anything wrong. You were both consenting adults- probably wouldn't have worked out for an actual relationship since you're at different stages of life, but a casual crush thing at work seems ok	Ok_Marionberry_8077	reply	na	na	na	0.9907440543174744	no	no	no	na	relationships
"I think we see a lot of the age gap conversations online and don't recognize one of the core features of why it comes across as a concern. The best and most obvious example is Leo, he seems to seek out those less than 25 years old based on his dating preference. That 'seeking out' is largely what makes it uncomfortable in my mind. If a 28 year old was trying to find a 22 year old to date, that'd be when red flags would go off. Intent in these situations matters majority in my mind, because the whole concern is why that older person would seek out a younger mate. 

Situations like this, I can't side eye it. It happens, you both seem like you were in similar life stages, you found each other organically and developed feelings overtime for the person. Not the idea of a person. That to me is genuine. 

So I don't think you should feel inappropriate/creepy/weird as it doesn't sound like them being young was the main point of attraction for you. It sounds like them being them, was what caused the attraction."	Ok_Marionberry_8077	reply	na	na	na	0.9907440543174744	no	strong	no	na	relationships

I think it's more of a maturity thing. It's a fact women mature faster than men. A 22-year-old man just isn't going to be at the same level.

“You left our family, SD wasn’t worth more than my mistake, we aren’t worth it to you, if you feel bad maybe you shouldn’t have left so quickly.”

Actual quote. Kicker is, I still have things at the house, including my china tea set my dead grandmother gave me when I graduated high school. The rest of it idc it can be replaced but that box? Ugh I haven’t told him but I can’t block him till I get that.

Go with a friend (preferably a big dude) to pick up your tea set and then leave and never look back. Stop talking to him, stop engaging with any of his desperate tactics, stop allowing him access to you. Block every single communication channel he has and move on with your life.	sjhearts	reply	na	na	na	0.9990724325180054	no	no	no	na	relationships
"I think some harsh words are needed....

Stop being lazy and go get your stuff. Otherwise, that tea set means nothing to you. That should be your number one priority over anything else. 

Sorry, had to say it. Find a friend or two, preferably male and large, to go with you, text the ex to find out a day when he'll be home, and get your stuff. If he asks why, use a vague answer like ""I need to see you about something."" If he asks for details, ""I'll tell you when I see you."" Don't let him know you're bringing friends. Don't let on that you're picking up stuff. And make sure that you have enough room to safely carry away anything and everything you need to get from his place.

Separately, add the closest police department non-emergency number to your phone so that if he tries to hold any of your stuff ""hostage"", you can call them without having to call 911 and get ignored.

Once you've got your stuff, block him and move on."	sjhearts	reply	na	na	na	0.9990724325180054	weak	no	no	na	relationships
"Arrange time to pick up your things (dont mention the tea-set, dont want to risk 'accidents"" or 'misplacements') and show up with a friend..  be cordial, dont engage in discussion..

And remember the lesson your parents relationship taught you...

If you cant get the tea-set back...  ask yourself what your grandmother would say: look after yourself, tea-set is just things, you are whats important...

"Me and bf have been in a relationship for 9 months now. It’s a very healthy relationship we love eachother and always discussed having a future together, we both want kids and a house. 

I work full time and financially very well off and he is still finishing his course but works and financially stable. He recently decided to get a job that pays less so he can focus more on his course.

I knew that until he finishes his course I would be the one paying more and all but recently he told me he wants to change careers and maybe he doesn’t see him working in the field that he was once interested he is also thinking of dropping out of his course. He told me he might want to move somewhere different. In all this he never mentioned anything about us, I asked him about it and I said seems like he isn’t even considering the relationship. He said he wants me to accept this and support him in his decision. 

I’m happy for him if he has changed his mind about his future but I can’t see raising kids with a man who is no decisive about his future which he doesn’t agree. He wants to be with me but he’s life style is something I won’t feel comfortable with. I want my kids to have a comfortable life and parents who are available for them. I don’t want to push him to do something he doesn’t want and it seems like because he doesn’t want to end the relationship he will accept my terms but then that will make us both unhappy in the end. 

It breaks my heart to even think about this but I just don’t see our goals matching anymore and the indecisiveness made me lose the confidence in this relationships future. This is making me think I should let go of this relationship. Also I want kids and don’t want to keep waiting forever for the things to be right because I’m in a good stage in my life. 

Should I breakup with him because our future goals don’t match anymore even though we love eachother? How do I even talk to him about this?

Tl;dr 
Bf is indecisive about what he wants and has different life goals now than what we discussed before starting our relationship, this is making me think if I should leave the relationship."	Hector_Dev	post	23.17027755917895	female	White	0.9970292448997498	na	na	na	9	relationships

"The important thing in partnership is how much you complement each other. Some people just need to try out two or even more things, until they get onto the field they want to stick with. This doesn't mean, they are not reliable. Not necessarily, that is. How is he in other fields, like everyday live, doing the chores, coming in time, getting his taxes, done. All that. Is he attentive to you, does he bring you flowers, is he discrete, when you need time for yourself? You catch my drift. Because those things are the hardware of a relationship over decades.

Professionally, someone can hop around, but still be consistent. In that he always use the same skills or does the same stuff. I hopped several professions, until I found out, that it always the same things I did best, like explaining stuff or planning stuff.

Yes he literally wants to throw it away but that’s my opinion and maybe I’m too practical but I just can’t trust someone to raise a family who constantly have this crisis. He says he just isn’t interested in earning much money (which Is fine, but then how are we supposed raise kids? Have a house? I don’t want someone who will depend on me) and one day deciders he is unhappy. I’m happy for him to follow his dream but I just can’t ride on this it’s just not feeling practical in my age and with my goals which I have been honest with him.

"Not trying to convince you into something. Just trying to put in my perspective.

Being ambitious can come in many forms. Also in many velocities. Not being professionally ambitious can be a sign of a unreliable person. But that should show in other fields, too. It can also be a sign of someone who puts more attention on the second line, on people, on social environments, on mental and emotional loads of partnerships. Or it might be, that he is of slower pace than others. Which opposite of common believe, is a quality. All this would also show in the small things of everyday live.

The question is not so much, if you can level out every playing field in a partnership. The question is, if the sum is even and levelled out.

He is asking for support. Can he be as much as supportive to you as you to him at the end of the day.

An obvious question in partnerships for you would be, can he be there for the children when you bring the bread home? Just as an example.

You have to evaluate this question for you first, and then discuss this with him. It is legit. I believe it is these questions, you need to put your emphasis on in your decision, and not so much career choices."	Hector_Dev	reply	na	na	na	0.9970292448997498	no	no	no	na	relationships

"Hey guys, I'm just wondering if I just give up on my relationship and go back to my family.

Context: Online dating for 1.5yrs, living together with him and his family since this April. 

Some issues are:
- Him smoking. We've argued quite a lot about it and to some point, wanted to part ways but we had a conversation and he promised to reduce. However, over the past 1-2 months I noticed his breath smelled less horrible, and so did his clothes. But recently, I think he started to smoke a lot again. 
I asked him whether he's having stress or something and how I could help him, he just said just work stress and stuff. I don't want to press him too hard on his smoking, instead trying to encourage him to reduce but I'm currently having a hard time but easily get pissed off inside as I don't feel like he's trying to reduce. 
What pisses me off the most is the fact that he breathes out that horrible smell into my face whenever I ask him that he just smokes even though he promises not to do so. And he even dances in front of me. 

- Him not spending time with me, rather doing something else (not with girls) and once he starts doing it, he loses track of time and sense of surrounding. Whenever we set the time to get out of the house, say 9, it's gonna take at least another hour for us to get out just because he has not finished his stuff and he needs to get ready. I'm almost always the one to wait for him.

- Him doesn't want to sit in the car with me to teach me how to drive (I just passed my knowledge), and he said that I'm a grown up now and I need not somebody to babysit me. I tell him the difference between babysitting and having responsibility because I have not had an official DL, and that he is supposed to be there with me. He even said that I feel more comfortable and less stress when driving when he's not around. Like wtf is that kind of excuse. 

I told him that he was not there when I needed him, and he said that a grown up doesn't need to be babysat????

These things make me feel insecure and unstable, in addition to the financial instability. I've been trying to heal and calm myself down in this relationship. I never feel calm when he hugs me or soothes me anymore because my inner self doesn't trust the fact that he does changes, but then immediately goes back to before

I don't know if I should just give up because I feel like my limits are being tested constantly. And I know what I can offer in a relationship....

TL;DR: Feeling like giving up on relationship due to some long-standing relationship issues with BF"	gumball_bunnie	post	25.565442532003043	female	White	0.9994532465934753	na	na	na	5	relationships

Tl;Dr short- Guy I'm dating makes me feel I'm too needy/sensitive. I don't want him going to bars with guy friend that only wants to hook up w girls. I don't want him to like thirst traps. He disrespectful by telling woman morally he can't be with them. Stubborn and won't apologize until after a fight is full in force, but when I'm mad, tells me I don't have a right to have a disrespectful tone. Says I'm revenge seeking even though communication doesn't help, only thru doing the same actions he does to me he understand his wrongs. Am I also disrespectful or does he not respect me?


As the question proceeds, I have had such bad anxiety/depression that caused me to isolate. Finally got to a place where I want to re-enter the world and got on a dating app. Met the guy I've been dating now for 4 months & many ups and downs. I know the usual advice is just leave. However, I'm willing to put in the work as long as it's not an unhealthy environment. I struggle knowing if I'm too sensitive and I have a huge fear of injustice, so it makes for a disaster in dating. Long story short, he and I both have our imperfect differences. We both have good as well. When we first got together, he put so much effort and was all around great. Driving 2 hrs back and forth to see me. Brought me flowers each week. I was still undecided if me and him should date as he just got out of prison for over a decade and only out a few months when we met. Basically, he robbed a store at 18. I don't judge people and he was motivated to do better and was heavily involved in the church. After 2 months, I felt more comfortable with giving this a real shot. However, these past 2 months I feel so much has happened and I will list them below with his explanations.

1. Liked a girl's half nak*d thirst trap who lives near him. Said he knew her and wanted to say good job for losing weight. Later, he apologized and said it wouldn't happen again.
2. Went to bars with his close friend he met who is 21 and constantly trying to hook up with girls. Said he talks to girls but that's it. Told him I didn't feel comfortable with that, so he no longer goes without me.
3. An older lady he met thru work likes him alot, he went to the movies with her as friends. She still texts him and he told her ""morally I can't be with you"" instead of ""I don't like you like that"" and he can't understand why I'm upset by it even tho guys that msg me I always say ""I have a bf"" out of respect.
4. He did yell at me aggressively 3 times. When fighting he screamed ""Get the f out of his house"" He apologized the next day and promised it wouldn't happen again. However last weekend we were walking and both tripped on the side walk in public, he yelled ""what the f"" to me in front of ppl. He apologized and said he was embarrassed and shouldn't have taken it out on me.
5. Around his friends, he likes to bring me try embarass me. For example ""she likes to watch tiktok and get all of her info from there"" which isnt true but then told me last week he downloaded tiktok..
6. We set boundaries to build better relationship. He just broke 1 of the most important boundaries and even tho he apologized, I can't trust his word now. He flip flops his feelings and apologies too much.
There are other things but these are the main issues I have.
 These are the issues he has with me.
1. He says my depression brings him down. He will tell me to suck it up pretty much.
2. Says I'm negative, which I do agree and have been working on that.
3. Says I'm revenge seeking. Basically, when I keep telling him how I feel and he argues with me, I show him through the same actions so he can understand how it feels. Says I shouldnt do what he does. For example, He went to FL with friend and I txted him at 12 at night and he never responded back. Told me he fell asleep but nothing happened with a girl even tho I know they were going out to a bar. He couldn't understand why I was so upset that all I wanted was a text back. So I told him I was going out the next night and for 3 hrs I didn't txt back, he freaked out on me and ""broke up"" w me. We worked it out the next day but he finally understood why I was upset.
4. Says I'm too moody in the mornings (I can agree to that lol)
5. He tells me that I shouldn't get upset or have a disrespectful tone even if he gets me to that point after trying to communicate with him calmly. That two evils don't make a right.

He does admit that he could do better for me after most of our fights.
I can't tell if he really is clueless or playing stupid. I do feel like he's good about finally understanding my feelings (after arguing and being stubborn) and then will change the behavior for the most part. He is really stubborn though. I can be stubborn too but I always try not to be disrespectful towards him. I don't yell at him or go to bars or flirt with other men. I just can't understand if he genuinely cares or is trying to push my boundaries. I would like to know if I'm too sensitive about him understanding my feelings or if we aren't a good match. I don't think overall he is a bad guy. He has grown alot from the person he used to be from what he tells me and I wonder if being in prison for a decade, he is learning to be in a relationship again. I know I also have faults but I can't help but feel like he doesn't respect me at all. At this point, I'm okay if we break up but I want to know if I allowed too much disrespect or if I'm too sensitive?"

At some point if someone has such different desires and perspectives in life, of course they are going to start making you feel needy or that you're asking for too much. This is not just one single instance, it's a lot. And to expect him to change all of these things is unreasonable- not because you don't deserve better, you DO!

"**TLDR: My boyfriend (together 4.5 years, cohabiting 3.5 years) says he downloaded Tinder accidentally. Evidence is at best semi-supportive of this and at worst extremely suspicious. I can’t tell if he’s gaslighting me or telling me the truth. Either he’s playing me, or I’m hurting our relationship by suggesting he’s a liar. WTF do I do?**

Last night my bf was showing me something on Insta and when he closed it I saw Tinder in his “Recently Downloaded” tab. It was the newest app, listed after one he downloaded on our vacation 2 weeks ago and another app he downloaded with me 3 weeks ago.

He told me he had no idea it was on his phone, and that he must have downloaded it by accident. I’m a lawyer. I believe in a fair trial. So I asked to see his phone while he watched. This is where it gets complicated.

He was calm and happy for me to look through his phone. He let me try and log in to Tinder using his emails, Apple ID etc and there were no associated accounts. He let me look at his screentime for the last month and Tinder isn’t listed on there once. He assured me he has no interest in other women and tried to console me without ever getting upset or angry. All of this backs up what he’s saying.

But Tinder is \*suspiciously\* absent from his screentime. It doesn’t even show up for the five mins we spent trying to log into it, even though other apps are listed that day at 17 seconds of use. He says this proves he’s never used it. I’m also 80% sure I saw him messaging a on what looked like Tinder when he thought I was asleep the other night. It stuck out bc it was in light mode when all his messaging apps are in dark mode, but it was a split second. If anything, the fact that Tinder isn’t listed on screentime for the past month suggests that isn’t what I saw at all. Also, my BF is boomer level bad w/ technology. It's unlikely he'd be able to strip an app from his screentime etc. He can barely use his phone.

Lastly, I also once caught him lying about sleeping with another woman when we’d been casually dating for 4 months, but we put it down to different ideals about dating because he was pretty promiscuous/liked to sleep around and we hadn’t discussed being exclusive. It's ancient history at this point but now I’m thinking about it again.

I’m not stupid. I know there is no smoke without fire and this smells like fucking BBQ extravaganza. But I love this man, and he loves me. His adoration of me is what most people comment on when meeting us for the first time. He’s a great boyfriend and most of the time it feels like he stepped out of a romcom and into my life. He’s my best friend. We were planning to spend the rest of our lives together. Now I’m not so sure.

My gut says he’s lying to me and I can’t shake it, and that scares me, but sometimes my gut feelings are wrong. My lawyer brain is saying that this is all super fucking suspicious, but the fact he let me Nancy Drew his phone, as well 0 hard evidence, support his claims. My heart needs solid proof to even consider leaving him. Right now, I'm weirdly most worried about the possibility that he’s telling the truth and I’m hurting our relationship by not trusting him. I feel so conflicted.

Am I being insane? Is he gaslighting me? Is there any way I could find out for certain if he's telling the truth or not? What the fuck do I do?

He's not gaslighting you, he's just lying and covering his tracks.

As to what you do about it, I have no idea. The immediate issue is the lying and doubling down a lie. Maybe he cheated, maybe he was looking to fantasize, that's hard to say without more evidence and digging.

Emily seems like a lovely person and I feel blessed to have discovered that I now have an older sister. She's married and has two young kids. I haven't met her husband or her kids yet, though she wants to introduce me to them soon.

Through talking with Emily, I've since learned that my father had a one night stand back when he was a grad student in university, and that her bio-mom later put her up for adoption. My father does not know that Emily exists. Emily seems to have had a happy life and grew up on the other side of the country. While I grew up in California, she grew up on the East Coast. I now live in the East Coast and I've even met Emily in person for coffee once and we share many of the same physical features (same eyes, same nose, tall height, etc.).

Anyway, here's why I'm on Reddit and asking for help. Emily wants to get to know the rest of the family and meet them. As far as I know, I'm the only one in my immediate family who used 23andMe, and Emily hasn't met anyone from my family yet. I've told Emily a bit about my father (61M) and sister (25F) but haven't really mentioned much. Emily wants to meet our father and sister. 

I haven't told my family about Emily yet. The truth is, my father was extremely abusive growing up and I'm basically in limited contact with him with the occasional text every few months. I haven't seen him in years. I talk to my mother on the phone occasionally. 

How do I proceed from here? How do I go about explaining to the rest of my family the existence of my older half-sister? I feel like doing so would cause a huge rift between my parents. I'm not sure how my other relatives would even react to this. And, while I'm 100% Asian-American, Emily is half-Asian and half-white and super white-passing. I'm not sure how my parents and other family members would react to this. Several of them are pretty racist.

I'm not sure how Emily will react to meeting my father. My father was abusive and is toxic and sexist. I feel like she'll be disappointed when meeting him. She's told me that she's always wanted to know a bit about her father and get to know her Asian side of herself. 

I've thought about maybe telling my sister first and asking her what she thinks and going from there, and starting with introducing my sister to Emily first.

Any advice on how I should proceed from here? How do I bring this up to my family? How do I introduce them?

TL;DR: I discovered I have an older half-sister. We share the same father. She wants to meet the rest of the family. Neither knows the other exists. My father was abusive growing up and I'm not sure how to explain this to my sister, or how to proceed from here."

I've been casually seeing this guy for a year now. (Were basically friends with benefits). Recently he told me he passed his test and now makes more money. I told him that I hope he'll give me a ride on his motorcycle when he gets one. And he said that it'll have to wait because he has other things he has to pay off first. I told him that I know he has to take care of more important things first. But that was just something exciting to look forward to and that I'd have to get a leather jacket and he said I'll need more than that.

"Been together for 6 years, engaged for 1.5. she lived in a country on the other side of the world for five years after college and she tells often that she misses it. 

When we first started talking, I explicitly remember telling her that if she plans on moving out of the area, this isn't going to work. I told her because the last person I dated decided to move across the country and gave me a week notice so I didn't want to repeat of that. She assured me that she was in the area for the long-term. 

The topic tonight came up of her possibly trying to get a job as a professor in this other country a little bit down the line and I told her that I didn't want to leave the area. I had already lived in a different state for six years and I missed my home state, where I'm at right now, every day and I have no desire to ever leave again. 

We done got into a huge argument and she said that if I got a job in a different area she would have no problem picking up and moving away. I said that's great but I feel very differently, all my family and lifelong friends are here and I love the area so I don't want to leave. 

She said that I'm being selfish by not even entertaining the idea or having a serious sit down talk about it. I told her I'd be more than willing to have a sit down talk with her but she has to understand that it's a 99.9% chance I'm going to not want to do it.

We left it at that and stop talking about it for the time being. Am I in the wrong here?

"It's not selfish to have an opinion, especially on something as big as where you live and what you do and see on a day-to-day basis for years.

Incompatible, maybe. Selfish? No.

Not that pointing fingers is going to be beneficial at all, but if it is then she's just as selfish for not respecting your need to be close to home and your friends.

It will feel different for her, of course. She's moved around more than once, and I assume isn't from the area you're currently living in, so to her it's just another place she could live and work, but to you it's your whole world.

That said, travel broadens the mind, and maybe the other state you lived in was just not the place for you. Relationships are built on compromise, so perhaps part of entertaining the idea could be to go on holiday to the country she wants to move to, with the understanding that you very much doubt you'll change your mind.

It still sounds pretty shitty for her to judge you for not wanting to leave your home, but well-travelled people seem to see the world slightly differently, and to them it doesn't feel like such a big ask."	Midwestern91	reply	na	na	na	0.9952831864356995	weak	no	no	na	relationships

"We have been in a LDR for 5 years and less than one year ago we had the chance to move in together. At the moment we are going through some hardships (my fault) and I engaged in a toxic introspective trip with myself that it is tearing me apart (even though I am the culprit here). I will start therapy asap because I realize I can no longer deal with these intrusive thoughts. I am not sure on what is my goal here... maybe I just want to hear that I am not a bad person.  
  
So, three years ago I was Teaching Assistant at some course at the University and I had a female student who behaved a bit strangely. She had this behavior with other TAs too, but at some point she seemed to ""target"" me specifically (or at least so I thought): she would ask many questions via emails and occasionally swing by my office for further clarifications. It was quite unusual to receive so many emails and office visits from a student, but everything was always kept professional. Everything was always on topic. There were also some rumors circulating about her.  
  
After she stopped being ""officially"" a student of mine, we had a few more conversations on facebook (she started): maybe a couple of messages every two weeks or so, and the topics were either University related stuff (she would ask for hints in solving some problem) or books / movies ""exchange""; nothing more than that, nothing I would not say if my SO was present too. Also, since I was not entirely sure on what were her purposes (assuming she had any), I ""casually"" hinted to the fact that I was in a relationship at least twice.  
  
My SO knew (at least to some extent); I told her I had a ""stalker"", even though I do not even have ground to call her that. It did not seem to bother her too much, but after a while I just cut off this person from my life because I thought it was no longer appropriate.  
  
What I am now overthinking on is my behavior and how I managed the situation. I feel terribly guilty. I feel I should have politely shut this way earlier and not dragged it just because. I think that deep within I felt flattered to have someone showing interest in my classes and my work; moreover I probably thought that she was of good appearance, and this somehow inflated my ego (I know, pathetic). This is what probably hurts the most; I displayed weakness, probably lack of integrity and I most likely hurt my partner too. I am a wreck.  
  
Any comment, suggestion, opinion is highly appreciated!

TL;DR: I possibly mis-handled a situation with a student of mine, and now I feel devastated by intrusive thoughts.  "	BlacksmithRare9217	post	29.060214995741383	female	White	0.9977052807807922	na	na	na	4	relationships

"Hi all, I (22f) have noticed that my bf (22m) relies on his mom for everything.

For example, I’m staying at his house for a week. One instance I noticed this is when his cat threw up on the carpet. Instead of just cleaning up the mess himself, he went and told his mom who was working remotely at the time (she’s a teacher). She went to clean it up.  2 minutes later, my bf went back out and noticed a second cat mess. Instead of just cleaning it up, he went back and told his mom “actually, most of it was in a different spot.”

So I’ve noticed that he calls her a lot to ask about different things. Another example is when he was sick. Instead of just calling the doctor himself, he called his mom, who then scheduled the appointment for him. And then, something got messed up with his prescription. Instead of calling the pharmacy himself, his mom did it for him.

This really bothers me. He’s a grown adult, he should be doing these things on his own instead of bothering his mom for them. But at the same time, it seems to be the way things are done around their house. 

Do I talk to him about it? Or do I stay out of it?

TL;DR! My bf relies on his mom to do a lot of things that imo he should be doing himself. What do I do?

Edit: hi guys, quick edit. He’s in college, I just graduated. He does not live full time at his mom’s we are just visiting for the week.

Also, he doesn’t act this way with me (yet). We’ve been dating for about a year. I also don’t think it’s weaponized incompetence, but more learned.

I don’t think it’s your place to do anything, it does sound like he has a codependent relationship with his mom but they probably don’t realize it.

It was just because my mom loves me so much and is willing to help with the smallest of things.

"Talk to him about why.

For example, with the cat vomit, this could be a situation in which he is reliant on his mom to do things he doesn’t want to do and making her do it or it could be a situation in which he has a controlling mom who wants to clean stuff like that herself in her own house and who would get angry at him if he did so. Similarly, with the prescriptions and doctor this could be anything from learned helplessness to weaponized incompetence to her having insurance paperwork she doesn’t let him access.

None of these are good things and all indicate some problems, but it’s not clear from these examples whether he wants to and is fully capable of doing these things but lives with a controlling parent who won’t allow it or whether he’s so dependent on her that you should fully expect to take care of him if/ when he moves out.

So step one is to hear what he says. If he gets defensive, dismissive or doesn’t see the problem you should probably reconsider whether he’s ready for an adult partnership. If he acknowledges it as an issue and is motivated to either move out on his own or work on doing these things for himself then consider how you feel about it.

Step two is to not move in together until he lives on his own for a bit. This really should be the way you do things anytime you’re dating someone who is living with their parents.

"Title. We had been going really well for a few months despite a significant issue with my sleeping schedule. I struggle to sleep and end up waking up halfway through most days and she felt she had a bf half the time. I work a 9-5 remote but sadly I can get away with this sometimes. I ended up getting on some meds that helped it and we had been going great. Prior to that was amazing and after it just seemed like a dream how well we were compatible.  
  
Fast forward to recently when I brought her to a yearly event with some hometown friends and it was going amazing, stayed away at a beach house together my family owns. The friends came over and I had a few of them tell me my one friend was getting handsy with her while a movie was on. Me and get end up going to bed a few friends hop in bed with us just kinda giggling. We were all pretty wasted. One ended up staying and turned over pretty quickly to start getting physical with her. I was in the bed, drunk out of my mind, and just said ""what the fuck"" and walked out. Shortly later my friend came out and felt horrible and insane about it. This man is married btw.  
  
He gave me the whole details. It wasnt kissing but he was under her shirt and she was rubbing on his P\*nis for a good few minutes. I felt pretty awful about this but brought it up to her that night, it didnt go real great, i dont remember alot that was said as we were both wasted but I remember her saying this was one sided, panicking, then going to bed.  
  
Next day we drive home and she can tell im not myself and in my head but we dont address as were both wildy hungover. Today we talked about it and I brought up if this is normal in her relationships and she just said "" I dont need to justify myself again."" and also mentioned if I didnt believe her and this is a contingency between us she just wants to break up and doesnt want to be with someone that doesnt take her side. She then gave me a laundry list of why im a terrible boyfriend, going from my room is sometimes dirty, (which we have both admitted this doesnt bother us and have prefaced before hangouts if it exists), to im just very unreliable and her friends have noticed even.  
  
I have admittedly missed some plans like movies in the past month after we talked about my sleep schedule, but I feel like ive been quite good to her. I have had issues like this in he past with my schedule but she really felt comforting and easy to really try and fix it for. I wanted to make her happy and that felt great for me to do so. I feel like I really wasnt as awful as she mentioned. I saw a huge future with her and everything felt so easy together, from conversation to banter to just day to day things. She had trouble moving into her new class room for teaching and I loved coming out to her help. I did miss one day when I said I would for work but that felt out of my control.  
  
TL;DR I feel really off balance as a person after being Quote un-Quote ""Cheated on"". This all felt forgivable and fixable for someone I felt so worth it with, But she wanted to dump me and give me a lot of reasons why before even discussing it.  
  
I havent had a huge unsuccess with finding myself in relationships with people I get a long with really well. But I feel like I keep running into this issue of being left with a laundry list of reasons why im a terrible bf and the inconsistency is always a leading one. How can I learn and improve from this?

"TLDR: Saw text my GF sent to her ex, now seriously questioning her love for me, especially after thinking longer about it.

Here's what happened: by chance I saw on my girlfriend's cell phone (when it was in her hand) a text message from her ex-boyfriend. About the history: It was supposedly a very unhealthy relationship, with many ups & downs, toxicity, manipulation etc.

I was surprised because she supposedly hates this ex. I confronted her and was allowed to read the text messages. The first message came from him, he wrote he had changed, apologized, would like to meet to find a conclusion of the relationship. he also wrote that he had loved her very much and it was virtually paradise with her.

She wrote back that she also had loved him very, very much at that time and that she could imagine meeting and talking things out.

The messages were a few days old, she had never told me about it. She told me she wanted to but didn’t want to upset me (dunno if I can believe that).

I also come from a relationship and we had a deal to be very honest and transparent with each other and to tell each other everything. i kept this part of the deal, when iIwrote with my ex it was only about things that were still with her etc. and i still told my girlfriend every time there was contact. full transparency and honesty.I felt very hurt and betrayed, also got very upset about it and made it clear how much it hurt my trust. we then also continued the discussion via text messages and one passage made me very, very upset:

""It never really felt ""safe"" for me in life. Either I felt like I was on my own or someone just did as selfish as they wanted and I never knew 100% where I stood. So it's a weirdly primed mindset, which is not psychologically healthy, and besides my manupulability, one of the main reasons I was so dependent on ""ex BF"".

The love for you, or let's say for now, the relationship with you, has a very different nature. A very quieter and also calmer one. I have, used to this blatantly toxic ex-relationship, no real feeling for how intimate the love is that my counterpart feels. And of course, I also have a hard time trusting that the love is real and also good for me. This year I have doubted myself over and over again whether what we feel for each other is ""deep love"" or a security that I am looking for, and that you may have been looking for as well. This blatant desire of merging or this inner deep connection, which were very important for me in a relationship so far, came up much less between us than I sometimes wished for. Instead, there have been other things, and new experiences that have shown me completely different facets of relationship.""

I read this as: Basically she loved the other guy more. I’m not really keen on being in a relationship with someone who had a stronger bond in a previous, toxic relationship than with me. My ego and my feeling of self worth really don’t allow it. 

Right now I called for a break until I figure everything out for myself. She wants to keep me, says she loves me, cried alot etc. but I’m just not sure if I can ignore all the red flags.Just venting here, maybe someone has comments."

"“She wrote back that she also had loved him very much, very much at the time and that she could imagine meeting and talking things out.” 

The fact that she wasn’t transparent with you and responded with the statement above is all you need to know. I don’t know if there were other messages and the the tone of those but this doesn’t seem like it would be for “closure” but testing the waters. Your GF can play naive at EX intentions but she wouldn’t have kept it secret if she really thought it was innocent or valued your relationship. 

I don’t know if you should break up with her or not but my advice would to at very least have her go no contact with her ex and set strong boundaries. Only issue is how would you know if she was just hiding it better since it was luck that you found out the first time.

Edit- although reread your story it sounds like the boundary and expectations for communicating with exes was already established. You followed those boundaries and she didn’t. That is already a serious breach of trust. She might have made a bad judgement call or you might have caught her before it progressed. Only you can decide which you believe and how to proceed."

Via her own words, she comes from a family of dysfunction and her normal meter is broken.

So, she was prime meat for her abusive ex-boyfriend.

Upon embarking on a relationship with you, she would at first be unaccustomed to being treated respectfully without drama and find it unsettling at first, which she did state.

Yet, if she was on the path to healing and truly attracted to you, she should have gradually felt a sense of relief, calmness, and joy at being in a truly supportive relationship.

Instead, she relays that she isn't feeling the love connection but a sense of blasé security and questions it.

Her hiding / lying about her ex contacting her and more importantly that she was indeed planning to meet with him, especially given the intent and tone of his text,  would have me just running for the hills.

Let him have her.

"You probably jumped the gun a bit by ""calling for a break"" while emotions were high. Advice here might be pointless if you already acted anyway.

It sounds like her love for the ex was past tense. Toxic relationships can be intense and involve strong emotions and bonds. She may have fallen deeper into love with you down the road. If you directly asked her who she loved more that was your own fault for playing with fire.

The text being kinda hidden is a bit shady. How shady kinda depends on what she meant by talk things out. For just closure they could text or have a phone call though.

An important aspect would be if she is over the guy or open to dating him again.

And for what it’s worth, it seems like her ex did a number on her mental health. I think she probably wanted some “closure” but entertaining a toxic ex is never the way to go. She should probably see a therapist so she can hash out the damage brought on from her toxic past, as it seems like she hasn’t fully healed from that.

"Let me start by saying I love my girlfriend. She's amazing, funny and sexy. A few months ago she lost her job and her new job doesn't start until next week. Since then she's been hanging around the apartment doing the bulk of the cooking and cleaning and taking care of the dog. She's always around. It's frustrating. She'll leave for about 3 hours in the middle of the day for walks and stuff but then she comes back and is always asking me questions while I work (Can I make you lunch? Did you take out the dog? How's work going?) 

Today I snapped and told her to leave me alone. I didn't raise my voice or yell but I explained to her I need my space and she was bothering me. She started crying and left the apartment. We talked a little when she came back but I started playing my game to unwind and she got even more upset because I told her we'd watch a movie or something. Now she's sleeping on the couch and won't talk to me because she ""doesn't want to bother me.""

She has been doing a lot around the flat and you don’t seem particularly grateful. She has a job lined up so it’s not indefinite. There’s only so much time she can actually spend outside the flat without anywhere to go.

Saying that she’s bothering you then ignoring her after you told her you would spend time with her, I can see why she’d be hurt. She may well be feeling self-conscious that she hasn’t been working already. 

You need to apologise and make clear that you value your time together but set boundaries for when you’re working.

"My friend, I'll call him Kyle, broke up with his abusive Gf this past weekend. He was watching her cats for her since she works as a home health aid of some sort. It was planned that he would return them on Wednesday. She is now demanding that he take the cats for 3 months. He has refused, but she also knows how to manipulate him into doing what he wants since they've been together 3 years.

He has told her that he won't be keeping them that long and she needs to find someone to help her with them. He even agreed to go to her house to feed/clean up after them for those 3 months while she looks for someone. She knows how much he loves those cats, but she refuses to take them back if he won't agree to keep them.

She's diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and takes Lexapro to help, but refuses therapy. So she's done some fucked up shit to him to get him to stay with her over these 3 years every time he's tried to break up with her. I've tried walking him through responses, and trying to keep communication to texting only. So its not as easy for her to manipulate him, and to have evidence if she tries anything.

The moment he finally got through to her that he is returning the cats when planned. She obviously freaked out, told him that he's gonna have to keep the cats indefinitely now so she can move on. Then blocked him. While he loves these cats, he already has 2 of his own that do not get along with the Ex's cats. So he cannot keep them if he wanted to. I'm not sure if they're microchipped or not, but he'd have to rehome them or bring them to a shelter. Which will break his heart even if its the right thing to do.

I have really given him all the advice I can, but I just wanted to know if there is really anything else he can do in this situation? To either make her see reason, and take her cats back or to rehome/take them to a shelter?

He's too kind to be mean to her or hurt her anymore than he already has by breaking up with her. Which imo she deserves a lot worse than just getting broken up with in the first place. He's just stuck, and I have no idea what else to say to him.

"She won't see reason. That's not something that's *possible* for her.

If he gets unblocked, inform her by text that if he cannot return the cats to her by X (very short time), he will rehome them. Screenshot the text, save it to a computer. 

If he doesn't get unblocked soon, text from a different number (yours if you're comfortable with it, or another friend) the same thing + ""unblock me and contact thru my number if you still want them"" then immediately block.

Regardless, remind him that if the cat handoff does happen, he shouldn't be alone with his ex for HIS safety.

"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years. He resently had both of his parents become ill and his mom has not fully recovered. He slowly started to shut down slowly by deleting social media until he shut me out and won’t talk to me about it or why. At first I took it personally but got to understanding he is overwhelmed and afraid of loosing his mom. So I asked him if he needed space and he said yes, I asked if he wanted me to stop texting him as well and he said no, he would respond when he could. So I have been doing what he asked for. I have offered him my support and even offered him to take him dinner and invited him over for dinner but I got rejected every time and he has been going over to his friends house everyday instead. Now im just wondering if he just doesn’t want me around at all. If he is trying to push me away so I could leave him or if this is his way of coping with the situation with his mom. I tried asking but his response is I don’t want to talk about it. So I haven’t asked him again, I just simply told him when he was ready to talk to just let me know. It’s been 3 weeks almost 4. I don’t know if I should bring it back up or keep waiting. I’m just confused with the situation and he is not the one to talk about his problems. So I don’t know if I’m being a problem or he is still dealing within him self.

TL;DR: Basically my boyfriend has shutdown because his mom got very ill and has shut me out and has been avoiding seeing me but makes times for his friends. I don’t know if he is avoiding me because he is overwhelmed or wants to break up."	Electrical_Mess_9784	post	21.58160957798314	female	White	0.9981410503387451	na	na	na	4	relationships

I understand he's going through something but this isn't 'partner' behaviour. Partners turn to each other when they're going through difficult life events, they don't shut each other out.

He’s shutting you out, not his friends. That’s personal.  I understand at times people don’t want to talk about things, but you’ve been together for three years, and he’s choosing to turn away from you instead of towards you.

I recently became with a coworker at my new job. He has a gf and he told me he did, it was never a secret, but he befriended me and is always super nice.

He mostly texts me, I rarely text him first, and he calls sometimes so we can play Xbox games. tbh sometimes the texts get annoying but I think I’m just not really a tester 🤷🏽‍♀️ I told my mom that I made a new friends at work and I also told her that he has a gf. 

Now anytime I mention him, she always says for me to “stop running around with that girls boyfriend” and says to me “this is not what we do as a woman” with a smirk on her face like she wants me to feel bad. I told her multiple times it’s not like that and I don’t even have romantic feelings towards him. she said that I’m only happy because I’m running around with that girls boyfriend. It’s just fun to have someone to play video games with and be friends with at work and that’s really all it is to me. If anything she should be happy for me because she said she wanted me to make friends at my new job??????

It honestly makes me want to not be his friend so she can leave me alone. Advice on how to deal?

Tl;dr- my mom is constantly trying to make it seem like I’m trying to steal some girls bf when that’s not the case and it’s making me feel bad about myself."	PowerPuffKittyy	post	20.35812142205563	female	Hispanic	0.008261773735284805	na	na	na	2	relationships

"my partner (25m) and i (25f) have been going through a rough patch. we have known each other for five years and have been involved for two of them. we have been long distance for about a year (in different countries) and the first six months of LDR were perfectly fine -- honestly, great. during the second six months, he developed really poor mental health issues and struggled to communicate with me via text and phone. i tried to be supportive but in retrospect, i could've done much better. i grew increasingly frustrated bc i felt that he could not meet my emotional needs. there were a few times where we attempted to break up, and i fucked up by seeing some other guys during those times, but we would eventually reunite.

finally, i had an opportunity to visit him in a few weeks, so we committed to working through this rough patch together in the weeks prior and during. i was still pretty upset abt him being unable to meet my emotional needs, but he said he was committed to working on it now that his mental health was starting to improve. we expressed deep love for one another, like we always do.

one night a few weeks before i am supposed to visit, i call him before bed like i normally do and he keeps rejecting my calls, which he has never done before. at one point he picks up accidentally, and i hear him talking to some girl abt catching a bus. i automatically assumed it was his friend or his friend's girlfriend. when he finally answers, he says he was just watching tv all night and we'd talk things over tomorrow.

the next day, he tries to end things with me. he tells me i'm one of the kindest people he knows, and that he wants to stay friends with me. i admittedly freaked out and tried to beg him to stay (i feel extremely pathetic about this). eventually, he agrees to stay with me, but comes clean and says he met someone and kissed her -- the girl who i had overheard him talking to the night before. when i get upset and call him out on his dishonesty, he kind of shuts down and starts making some disparaging comments like, ""you said you wouldn't want to be friends if we broke up anyway"" and ""i guess i was lying to myself abt our relationship."" 

i know i am not innocent here. i guess i'd just like to understand what is going through his mind. i feel really shocked and confused and hurt. i know it's probably not worth to salvage this but at this point i'm still just in shock. how do i respond?

TLDR; LDR partner kissed another girl, hid it from me and tried to break up with me, and when i found out he got weird, but i don't feel blameless in this situation. how do i respond?

"I’ve been in a relationship for 2 1/2 years with a really loving good guy whom I also love deeply. As I am moderately religious I do not want to have sexual intercourse until marriage which was made clear when we first started talking. He is also a virgin because he grew up as a devoted Christian. When we started talking he was agnostic but over the years has turned into a strong atheist. He has casually mentioned having the urge to have sex over the years  but I shrugged it off and told him I’d want to wait till marriage. We frequently engage in sexually activities without having sexual intercourse and I foolishly thought that would be “enough”. 

I was under the impression that we had a very open and trusting relationship but for the first time, I went through his phone without his knowledge yesterday.  I found screenshots of escort pages and archived messages to a few escorts asking for pay rates a few months ago. I confronted him about it a few hours after finding it because I was so LIVID and he knew something was seriously wrong due to my behavior. He was extremely apologetic and explained how it was during a weak moment of built up sexual frustration due to still being a virgin. He says he never went through with meeting any of these escorts and he was extremely ashamed and apologetic. He wanted to lose his virginity badly and saw getting an escort as a “quick hookup” to relieve the sexual frustration. He claims he is extremely satisfied and happy with me but didn’t want to further pressure me about sex and would never think about something like this if we were sexually active. 

It was only a period of a few days of looking at these escorts which he self reflected after that instance because it’s something so out of character and hypocritical. He has cut off a lot of porn/sexual (I was already aware of) from his phone since that situation and has since made apparent efforts to better himself. He says he was eventually going to tell me in the next month if we were serious about furthering our commitment to each other long term. We had planned a day in the next month to talk about the future of our relationship because my family’s approval him is initially unlikely due to his beliefs about religion. I will still be getting an STD check but I mostly believe him about the situation as I’ve come to learn over the years when he’s lying.

Another instance I’ve thought about past few days is how he’s taken sexual pictures of me without consent on two occasions. First time, I was sleeping in a “cute position” and he took pictures of my ass in my underwear. He showed me the pictures few days after and in the moment I shrugged it off. The last time, we were engaging in a sexual activity and after he asked to take pictures of me and I denied bc I didn’t feel up for it he continued to still take the nude picture when I wasn’t looking. I confronted him in that moment and I knew he was lying when he continuously denied it. I forgot about that situation and moved on and fast forward to yesterday, he admitted to that as well while coming clean about the escort nonsense. I know he hasn’t shared these pictures with anyone as I have thoroughly been through his phone and messages. 

I’ve been super emotional about this situation and I want to forgive and try to move on but part of me feels this a sign to end things despite our love for each other. Despite these situations, we really have been had over heels for each other these past 2 1/2 years. I’ve just been having a hard time wrapping my head around this and possibly forgiving him and moving on. He keeps stating that he’ll be completely honest with me moving forward nothing like this will happen again. 

How does one go about moving forward with this relationship?

TL;DR - My BF (22M) of 2 1/2 years almost cheated on me (22F) with an escort to lose his virginity and I don’t know how to move forward."	WildStallion1012	post	20.755436471614942	female	White	0.011992832645773888	na	na	na	4	relationships
"If you’re going through your partner’s phone in secret, the relationship is over, trust has already been broken if you feel the need to do that. 

The whole concept of virginity has done more harm than good, but if you feel it’s important to abstain from sex until you say your marriage vows, great! But I don’t think your boyfriend is actually interested in that, and to me, that’s a strong indicator of incompatibility. 

To be completely blunt, he isn’t the guy for you to marry. You both feel differently about sex and porn, and he felt entitled to take nudes of you without your consent, which would be a dealbreaker for most people. Trust doesn’t seem to exist in this relationship, and forgiving his transgressions and entitlement isn’t going to fix that. 

Not all the people we date are going to work out, and you’re still very young. There’s plenty of eligible bachelors who share your values.

"First of all. You have different beliefs therefore different worldviews. As someone who used to be Christian and turned atheist in my early 20s, I can tell you that many of my opinions and perspectives have changed a lot. In long term this will cause a divide between both of you, one of which will be on how to raise your children.

2. He hid it from you and only came clean because he was caught. What if you didn't find out? He probably would've gone through with his plans.

3. ""I was under the impression that we had a very open and trusting relationship but for the first time, I went through his phone without his knowledge yesterday"" so you trust him yet you webt through his phone? Doesn't sound trusting to me.

4. Taking nude photos without consent... Red flag. At least he was open about it and didn't hide it. Taking explicit photos against your will? That's a serious issue.

So you need to rethink this relationship. Are your values and worldvies compatible into the far future and familial commitments? Are you able to fully trust him ever again?"	WildStallion1012	reply	na	na	na	0.011992832645773888	weak	strong	no	na	relationships

"My boyfriend [30M] has a fun life but I [30F] don’t


I have been with my boyfriend for 3 years I would say I was pretty cool before him I did all these cool things went to all these unique places ect but then a year ago I realized I had a shitty job/career and went back to school. My boyfriend does not go to school but does have a career. 

My boyfriend is so cool he does things that are super cool to me such as fishing. He has all these cool pictures with these big cool fishes he also plays on a team sports and has all these nice friends sometimes I’m just jealous of him that he has such great skills, fun hobbies and friends while I don’t anymore?..

I know what everyone is going to say. Go get a hobby. Go do cool things. Go find friends

If it was that simple I would.

 Friendships do not come to me easily I been told I’m intimidating even though I really try to be friends with them nothing comes from it and it seems like people my age are just too busy with life 

I’m in school and full time work and it so hard to even try to have a hobby or to even do something!  

It’s so hard to be hyped for someone who had a great day while I had school in the am work in the pm and staying up to studying pass midnight 

It’s always work, school, workout it’s a 360 circle for me I feel like a loser? 

Our relationship is great tho I feel like he could be with someone cooler than me? He deserves a fun great life but duuuuccckk me I want to go back to having a life too

"Hello all, sorry to intrude on a subreddit where I don’t belong, but I (17M) want to send my friend (18F) a farewell card and a book from one of her favorite authors before we likely lose touch after this summer.

The only thing that concerns me though is that throughout the summer I've been busy with work and whatnot, so I haven't been able to hang out with her as much as I would have liked. As such, I've mostly just stayed in touch via text messages and two visits, which I'm afraid was most likely a selfish and annoying attempt on my part to make sure we were still in contact. 

TLDR: I guess what I'm trying to ask is whether or not I should respect her space and stop pestering her or if I should give her the card and gift because, at this point, I feel like I've just sort of unintentionally become a burden on her. However, at the same time, I feel like if I don't send her the card and never see her again, I'll feel this tinge of regret forever.

Thanks for making it this far, I know it's extremely petty and insignificant but it's been bothering me for a while now and I'm not friends with many women with whom I could get their perspectives.

"TL;DR My ex girlfriend’s sister is getting married Labor Day weekend. Months ago, she invited my then-gf and I, and we accepted. Last Wednesday, my gf and I broke up amicably. At the time of the breakup, my gf asked me to still attend the wedding with her, and after thinking it over for a day, I agreed. Now I’m having second thoughts.


Reasons for second thoughts.

1. Relationship with ex. The breakup, although initiated by my ex, was amicable and mutual. When I agreed to still go with her despite breaking up, it was because we were getting along so well. I can’t move out until this upcoming Thursday, so we’re stuck living together until then. I don’t feel like dating anyone anytime soon, but my gf is already talking to people on Hinge and went on a date yesterday. She talks about them a lot, even though I tell her I don’t want to know about her new dating life. She also been getting really pissed at me constantly, and the breakup is starting to feel less amicable. I can’t wait to move out on Thursday, and I don’t think I would enjoy a 6 day wedding trip with her anymore.

2. Relationship with wedding couple. My ex’s sister is the bride. I get along with the couple quite well and they like me, but we also aren’t close. We don’t have a relationship independent of our relationships to my ex.

3. Ex’s family. My ex’s family know we’re broken up of course. The wedding trip is 6 days long. That’s a long time to hang out with your ex’s family, and that’s a long time to hang out with your family member’s ex. We would be staying in the same Airbnb.

4. Money. We’re traveling from Illinois to Georgia for the wedding. I paid for my own plane ticket, and I was going to pay for my share of the rental vehicle. That sums up to $300. I’d gladly pay that for a gf, but it’s a lot for an ex, and she says she can’t cover the bill.

5. Time. I’d rather spend Labor Day weekend with my friends than as my ex’s plus 1 to a wedding.



My ex really REALLY wants me to not back out of the wedding. Her points are:

1. Logistics. There’s a large house some distance away from the wedding that has already been paid for where her family and I would be staying. I would be the only person there with a US Driver’s license. Neither my ex nor her family members attending drive.

2. Disrupting plans. The carefully planned wedding is mere weeks away. It would disrupt the wedding planning and damage the experience if I didn’t attend.

3. Sunk costs. I’ve already paid for my plane ticket. I can get a points refund, but not my actual money back.


EDIT: Thanks guys, I canceled my plane ticket and let her know I won’t attend."	raccoonadmirer	post	20.718781314074455	male	White	0.9977437257766724	na	na	na	22	relationships

"I understand that in some relationships, if you give up your romantic life you also give up your friendship. For me, sex and emotional closeness are completely separate things, so I don't think it will be emotionally complicated for me to stay friends.

Maintaining my boundary on not hearing about her new dating life is difficult until I move out on Thursday because while I can ask her to stop talking about it, I can't actually stop her. She's agreed to not bring up people from Hinge but keeps accidentally mentioning them.

Once I'm living on my own, it'll be easier to enforce that boundary.

"I get what you’re saying, and I want a good relationship with her moving forward, but I don’t want that relationship to be one-sided. If she doesn’t want to remain friends with me anymore because I won’t pay $300 and pretend to be dating her at a wedding for 6 days, I think that says something about whether she actually cares about maintaining a friendship or not.

But I don’t think she’d be too mad and it would really damage our relationship. I think she’d be pissed, and she wouldn’t enjoy the wedding as much, but when it came down to it, she’d still want to be friends and hangout.

"
Me (22F) and my ex (25M) broke up almost 2 years ago for the first time. Our relationship was a whirlwind, we met and instantly connected like crazy like nobody I’ve ever met, but I started to feel like he maybe had some commitment issues and the next thing I knew he was breaking up with me to move across the country. I was gutted. Eventually he moved back and we got back in touch, and ended up getting back together for a few months. He definitely wasn’t invested and was stringing me along, he took advantage of how much I cared about him, and I’m pretty sure only kept me around so he wasn’t lonely or to stroke his ego.  Eventually he broke it off about 16 months ago. I realized what a tool he was after we were done. I know I deserve better than the way he treated me, and I know that our lifestyles were never going to align. 

Fast forward to January, when I met my current boyfriend (23M). He is everything I could’ve ever asked for, and we click so well, but sometimes when we are arguing I can’t help but think of what my past relationship was like, the incredible connection we had in the beginning. 

I’ve also been having an increasing number of dreams about him recently out of nowhere, and saw yesterday that he has a new girlfriend, which honestly didn’t really make me feel any type of way, but I think it’s making my fixation worse. 

I’m also a highly sexual person, and sex with my ex was insanely hot, I wanted it all the time. I’m definitely more sexually experienced than my current boyfriend, and I’m never horny around him anymore. 

 I don’t want to feel this way. He is so perfect for me and I truly do love him so much. 

I have an anxious-avoidant attachment issue, and I know that because I was more into my ex than he was me, I crave that attention. Now that my current boyfriend is so loving towards me, it makes me push him away. (I’m going to therapy I know this is bad)

What can I do to move past this?

TL;DR: I still think and dream about my douchebag ex, even though I have an amazing boyfriend who I love."	Pale-Supermarket3680	post	17.383072178774196	female	White	0.9889264106750488	na	na	na	4	relationships
"Honestly leave this dude. He’s everything you want, but you still want your ex. That’s not fair to the current guy at all. You can’t be in a current relationship if you still love and want to be with your ex. That’s not fair or right at all. Comparing him to your past isn’t fair. 
I can’t say we all haven’t done it before. But you had a guy stringing you along for two years and made you question your worth and you knew he was using you. And you still have that love for him?
Don’t use this new guy as a ladder to get over your ex. That’s not cool. I say break it off with him and work on yourself. 
Attachment styles have nothing to do with this. Unfortunately attachment styles are more of an insecurity. 
You had that incredible connection with your ex because he was pretending to be everything you wanted. If it truly was amazing, he would have maintained it and been consistent with you.

"You’re fine, and this is a really hard issue. 

It’s normal to have difficulties moving from unhealthy relationships to a healthy one. The old one feels exciting to you because it was like a slot machine. Most of the time you’d lose but sometimes you’d win and it would feel like a jackpot. The sex wasn’t better, you were just more starved for affection so your brain painted it in a more special light. The other guy was also difficult so “winning” his affection felt like a prize, it made you feel more special. That’s why you are feeling weird about his new gf, you’re thinking what’s she got that you don’t. 

This new guy you have is stable, so he doesn’t make you feel that roller coaster. It’s not about “winning”. That’s okay, since the roller coaster isn’t good for you. 

One other thing… and be honest with yourself. Is your new guy honestly attractive enough for you physically and emotionally long term? I don’t mean compared to your ex. I mean do you think he is hot or is there some part of you that feels like you’re settling? If so, let go of him.

I completely realize that I have an amazing person in front of me. He’s not a ladder to “get over” my ex. I am over him, I don’t pine for him, the way he treated me makes me cringe. That’s what makes this all so much worse.

But I understand where you’re coming from. First I would work on understanding your attachment style more. Hats makes you anxious? What actions from your previous made feel that way? There’s an underlying cause on why that attachment style developed. Once you work on that you work on the healing process to move past your ex.

"My fiance really hates his brother, and its like a major red button for him.  
  
Whenever the brother is mentioned by his parents, he would shut down and just leave the conversation/ area. Im kinda worried about this and i really hope that this wont effect our relationship/ future family. He wont even tell me what happened between them, and we have been in a relationship for 5 years prior to getting engaged for a few months now. He only mentioned how he was bullied physically and emotionally by the brother, but never mentioned any details.  
  
He hates him so much to the point that he hates his brother's newborn son. Is this a red flag? but I do love him a lot and I really want to make this work, and I really want to help him, but I cant mention anything about it or he'll get really triggered. His relationship with his parents are good, not the closest its okay, but whenever the brother is mentioned by his parents he gets really mad and would react very emotionally.  
  
I come from a warm family, very loving towards each other though obviously not perfect. I myself was bullied emotionally but my elder sister but i moved on from it and we're fine now. I understand the pain of being treated horribly by an elder sibling so i dont want to judge him for having that grudge towards his brother.. but i feel like he has to let go and move on and not let his brother effect his life to this day. They dont even interact anymore and never see each other so i wish he could let it go and be more at peace with his life.  
  
Will this effect our future family together when we have kids? How will the kids feel about their uncle and cousins? will we really go no contact forever? Will he react the same way if he feels betrayed if I want to help him move on? I dont know what to do, I just feel very anxious of the future..

">Are there cases of people coming from toxic families, and have a loving new family that he made with his partner?

Yes. Among other things, this is the trajectory of most queer relationships prior to the past several decades. In general I think the need to cut off family members is much more common than what your experience has been, although this is clearly still a bit of an... unsettled situation. 

I concur with everything u/mawkish said. Please try to let go of the comparison between your own experience with your sister and his experience. It sounds like there is some serious trauma under this that he can't simply move past, and especially for men, that can seem impossible to talk about. He may react somewhat defensively at first. 

I think your future misgivings are reasonable but misplaced. It won't hurt your kids to have cousins they never see, and family rifts can be explained, if he can process it enough to do so without pure rage. (Actually, a family with no rifts or tensions seems pretty weird to me! I haven't met one yet!) But unprocessed childhood trauma can affect parenting, especially around the age they were abused. (Overprotectiveness, for example.) You should still talk to him about your concern for HIM before you start spelling out many anxieties about the future though. For someone who was a hurt child and is still all raw emotion, ""I'm worried you might hurt our future family or children"" can be pretty destructive to hear because it casts them in the abuser role they're scared of.

"You simply don't know enough to know what the right thing to do is. Admit that clearly to yourself and allow this ignorance to exist without trying to fill in any blanks yourself. Assumptions and presumptions can only hurt you. You're already going down too many paths of thinking about your children and their cousins and they don't even exist yet. You're WAY too far ahead of yourself here. Stop. Take a breath. 

You don't know. That's okay for right now. 

What you need to communicate to your fiance is that you are in a position of feeling anxious and unsure what the right thing to do is on this subject, because you are so in the dark. But I would caution against any pressure that he needs to ""heal"" in order to foster relationships with his family. Healing needs to only be for him. For him alone. 

Remember this is *his* family and *his* life, and very likely, *his* trauma.  How it is dealt with is up to him, and you are there to support him in it. That's what a spouse does. You have to be ready to accept that he might never heal. You have to be willing to accept that he does go no contact forever. They are his wounds. He gets to decide how to tend to them. 

But I think it's fair to say he's not in a place of healing if he is still reacting with so much anger. Perhaps you could ask him what he sees for the future with how he is responding inwardly to his brother. Does he want to be angry forever? Does he think maybe some work could be done in counseling or with self-help that might help him process and find some peace internally?

"I'm less concerned about the familial estrangement and more concerned with how he's reacting to it. 

> He hates him so much to the point that he hates his brother's newborn son.

A newborn child, even one related to an abuser, is an innocent party. It's disturbing that he'd express *hatred* towards an infant he's never met, just because of whom it's related to.

> whenever the brother is mentioned by his parents he gets really mad and would react very emotionally.

This is the behaviour of someone whom hasn't processed their trauma.

For the record, I'm estranged from my father, but I can talk about him in neutral terms. I don't wish him ill will, I just don't want him in my life. Even the people I've been really hurt by, I don't waste energy hating them, I'm just happy to not have to deal with them ever again. Estrangement doesn't have to be fuelled by permanent rage, and making peace/forgiving/moving on isn't the same as ""I will reopen a relationship with the person who hurt me.""

If your fiance is so consumed by his hatred of someone whom he has no contact with that it's *still* affecting his life on a daily basis, and he's now making a point of feeling hatred towards an innocent party just because they're associated with his abuser...this guy isn't processing his trauma, he's *nurturing* it. 

> Will this effect our future family together when we have kids? How will the kids feel about their uncle and cousins? will we really go no contact forever?

You should assume you will never met his brother or his brothers family. 

> Will he react the same way if he feels betrayed if I want to help him move on?

This is what I'm a little concerned about. Under no circumstances should you try to encourage your fiance to reconnect with his brother, but your fiance *should* be willing to let go of the anger. If he's going to hear ""I don't want you to keep nurturing this hatred"" as a *betrayal*, then I think you should be hesitant about tying yourself to this guy. 

Being married to someone means being with them through every dark part of life, and I'd be uncomfortable tying myself to someone who is choosing to maintain this kind of rage."	IntelligentThroat339	reply	na	na	na	0.9972568154335022	no	strong	no	na	relationships
"OP, I had a very similar experience to your fiancé, and do not speak to my brother due to prior physical and emotional abuse. 

Something else to consider is whether the brother in addition to being a bully was the favorite, which would explain your fiancés resentment towards his nephew and his anger when the parents bring the brother up.

There is no happiness or closure for your fiancé on this topic, and any time spent thinking about it is time spent feeling bad about himself and miserable. Don’t make him go there unnecessarily. People have no obligation to reconcile with their abusers, especially when that “reconciliation” involves behaving like the abuser expects you to. 

Will it affect your family? Yes. I have a happy, loving relationship with my wife of 20yrs and our children are generally happy and well adjusted. They do not have any interaction with their cousins however, and while this saddens me, I also don’t want my kids exposed to how my brother treats people including his wife and kids.

"I’m 20F, my boyfriend 20M, his friend 20M, and the friend’s fiancé I believe 21F.

A few months ago, we were having dinner with his friend group after a concert. They were reminiscing about a graduation trip from a couple years ago when my boyfriend’s best friend played a video someone took of him throwing frogs on said trip. He picked them up and chucked them as far as he could while the other guys (my BF included) laughed.

It disturbed the fuck out of me. Later I talked with my boyfriend about how upset it made me, but he tried to justify it by googling about frog’s perception of pain and quoted a link that said they feel physical pain but not emotional pain. He explained that it means they feel pain but have no idea whether it’s good or bad (which is wrong, emotional pain refers to rejection/loneliness/guilt). I argued that frogs wouldn’t exist anymore if they didn’t know pain was bad, and why would they evolve to develop pain receptors in the first place? It was a useless discussion and I left it feeling worse because it became a debate about amphibian physiology instead of my feelings.

Anyway, now his best friend is engaged. I was thinking about the frog thing again yesterday and concluded that if my boyfriend was the one throwing them instead of “just” laughing about it, I probably would’ve ended things. Then I realized I think I owe it to the friend’s fiancé to tell her, because I’d absolutely want to know. I asked a couple coworkers today who all agreed, and sent her a message from an anonymous instagram.

I made sure to reiterate that I wasn’t trying to mess up her relationship but thought she should at least know. She replied that she had a discussion about it with him and thanked me for reaching out, before asking my identity which I declined because I didn’t want bad blood with the friend for telling her. I think about a dozen people know what happened so I didn’t think I would be an easy guess.

But I thought wrong, because my boyfriend left me on read for an hour tonight despite being online, and when he didn’t answer my double text, then sent me to voicemail, he messaged me “I have to think about it some more before I talk to you.”

At this point, I’m disappointed that it’s a big deal to him. There’s been several things throughout our relationship that are kind of a grey area where I’m not 100% sure who’s “right” or if I should be feeling how I do. But this one is getting to me. How he can try to justify throwing frogs or not understand why I thought sending that message was the right thing to do.

I need some clarity, I’m struggling to get why he’s upset with me. Maybe he thinks me sending the message reflects him poorly to his friend, because I don’t share that sense of humor? Or maybe she broke up with him or postponed the wedding? If that’s the case, I would feel bad, but I’m just the messenger. I’m not the reason behind her decision, her fiancé’s actions were, no matter what brought them to light. I’d much rather she end it with cancelling wedding reservations than filing for divorce and changing her name twice and moving out.

Anyway, I feel lost and confused. What should I do from here? How big of a deal should this be to me depending on how big of a deal it is to my boyfriend?

TLDR; My boyfriend’s friend threw frogs as a joke a couple years ago during a boys trip and still laughs about it as of a few months ago. I anonymously told his fiancé because I would want to know before becoming legally bound to someone. The friend somehow knew it was me and now my boyfriend isn’t talking to me."	wonderouswanderers	post	29.92808528906224	female	White	0.9986454844474792	na	na	na	1	relationships
He's siding with an animal abuser over you, he's trash!!! People who abuse animals are often ASPD (aka sociopaths). The fiancee definitely needed to know she was marrying someone like this. If this wasn't about somebody hurting animals, my reaction wouldn't be this harsh but I'm sorry - he's being an ass to you because you were upset that he laughed at someone abusing animals. Because you warned the fiancee that she might be marrying a sadistic psycho.

If he starts stomping his feet and emotionally blackmailing you - you’ll KNOW where he can shove that blackmail - and you can tell him that. Run. He’s not ready to be friends (least of all anything romantic).

I talked about with him and he was offended and said that i didnt care about his feelings and in the end i said its none of your business what picture i like, then he said “fine do what you want. like all pictures of men you find thats what you want right. i dont want to hope for us anymore im just draining myself just to love you. When it comes to you u dont care about my feelings at all, im always the wrong one. I dont deserve this i hope you’re happy.

"It might not appear this way now, but this is progress! You took the crucial first step. He doesn't know yet either, but you did him good as well. All the venting and emotional blackmail he's doing now is to be expected. Let him stomp his feet, and I promise, that negative energy he's exuding will dissipate. He'll run out of steam eventually, like a child in a candy store. I'm in my late 30s, and literally every guy I know has had to learn this lesson from some girl who finally decided to stand up for herself (and vice versa).

I *know* it bothers you. That's natural. Accept it, like you would a nasty headache.  

Now, your second step is just as important. DO NOT undo what you've started by giving in and reaching out to calm him. I repeat: do not reach out. Stay in no contact! He's doing everything in his power right now for you to feel sorry for him. If you must - do it in your mind. Whatever you do, DO NOT let him see you bleed. This also means that you can't change your online behaviour. Whatever social media posts you make now (a song, a photo of a tree, or anything that doesn't fit your regular online behaviour) will be interpreted by him as victory: he will think he's breaking through to you. That is why I say again: don't change your pattern of behaviour. Carry on.

If (or once) he chooses to reach out in a mature manner, you can respond calmly. But do not be ""maternal"". If the situation were reversed, and you were a guy, my advice would be to not get ""paternal""... it's essentially the same thing. A child won't grow if they know you will come running when they start complaining. ONLY accept mature invitations to talk. You can even admit that you *do* feel sorry ""for the way things turned out"". But never make it sound like you are sorry for your actions. You can be sorry for the situation. Not your actions in it.

He can't sit with one butt on two chairs: that's the lesson for him here. You have as much right to like anything you want online as he does.

If he stands the test of time and comes back in 2-3 months a different person - you can continue. But if he tries to manipulate you again - say goodbye for the foreseeable future. It's best that you experience his behaviour now, than it is to prolong it by appeasing his emotions. Don't worry, this situation is as old as time, and happens to billions of people around the world. Nothing bad has happened, remember: it's just a regular stomach ache - a part of life.

Write back if he tries any shady manipulation tactics. I'll be here."	Timely-Twist-3583	reply	na	na	na	0.9985062479972839	weak	no	no	na	relationships
"Hi, he texted me.

For context, when we were together for 3 years he verbally abused me, he puts his friends first over me, he cheated on me with his ex, gbfs and he always liked pictures of girls and followed them and lied about his classmates who are pretty. This is only half of what he did to me. And the time we broke up, he said sorry for doing hurtful things to me and that he was scared to lose me, he didn’t talk to any girls he was constantly updating me and it looked like he changed so i said okay but i want to love myself first now and i want to focus on myself and he said he would respect it. 
Then after two months we became okay and he asked if he could court me again and i said okay but then he starts accusing and constantly says that im lying, that im talking to other guys, that he just wants me updating and sending him proof that im not talking to anybody because he says he is overthinking and he cant stop it and he says he needs constant reassurance for him to keep courting me, in his words “to energize him and inspire him into courting me”. 
This went on for two months, everyday. And no matter how i explain that im not talking to anybody. He still accuses me of it and when i got angry about it he says “so if we get back together its gonna be like this? You’re not gonna reassure me you’re just giving me false hope.” And that’s what we constantly fought about because he felt that ‘I didn’t care about his feelings and i was selfish it was supposed to be give and take and that he is always wrong’. 
The next thing was in a game he would make a big deal about ml and angela shit. And now this, because of a profile picture that i reacted on fb. 
It was too much for me to have this problem all the time and everyday so when we fought and he would say that im the bad guy and stuff for it and me “not reassuring him” (although i always reassure him i always say i never talk to any guy and that im not the kind of person he was) but he always want proof, and when he says i have no heart and i dont care about him anymore i would block him and then he says sorry very apologetically and he would promise he would be better i unblock him and the same shit of turning shit around happens again in the end I always look like the bad guy who doesnt care about his feelings and it repeats. 
Then last night before i blocked him we talked about it, i told him that he was just doing it because he was insecure about what he did to me and that’s why he thinks im doing the same thing he did before. And now he says “im soaking in my selflove too much and that i was giving him false hope”

Anyways this is what he said:

Him: Thats it? You will really just let me be? how can you do this? you are sick you never do anything when i go away you really just let me be, when you are the one walking away I'm chasing you, you are so unfair, I don't feel that you love me, you love me just because I'm always there for you, you dont care about me at all. you are very selfish. Your self love is too much you’re selfish. 
What’s wrong about you is you always give me false hope then im the stupid one who hopes again. What do you want? I can’t understand you. You know im a jealous person, you know me right? My overthinking is getting worse because of you. I want reassurance. before school starts, to reassure each other.
You say that I don’t change, but what im feeling is that i don’t want to get hurt it doesn’t mean im scared of my own shadow. Im not like other men, because when i get hurt, i hurt myself if only you knew. I hope you can understand it. I overthink, i get suspicious, and i get jealous because i love you, you know that im scared to lose you. I can’t say the things i want to say to you because I’m always the wrong one here.

That’s what he said, what should i do? Im sorry if the english is not the best its not my main language."	Timely-Twist-3583	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9985062479972839	no	strong	no	na	relationships
"Hi! 
What he’s doing is very predictable, but is also worse than I thought. A guy who flips back and forth between behaviors - his problem is not the lack of support he receives from a girl. He thinks your forgiveness is what he needs to get better, but he’s wrong. He needs you to bail him out. If you keep doing this, you’ll stall both - your progress and his progress. 

He will not grow unless you become strong very quickly. Sadly there is no other way. At my age, I still have situations in life when I realize that there’s no way back past a certain point: I have to do something very unpleasant in order to change a situation - such as talk to someone I’ve been avoiding; or do something I’ve been putting off. Without that, I can’t move forward.

Consider yourself lucky: you are now at that point. 

The closer you are to doing what needs to be done (ignoring him) - the more he will try to manipulate you. The more it will hurt. And he can’t stop. Nor will he. 

Three years is a long time, I understand that you are in the habit of seeing and speaking with him, so all of this must be really hard (for both of you). Unfortunately, one of you has to be stronger. And from what I see - you are already that person. You just need to believe it. 

Also remember: progress happens through unpleasant growth. Big decisions are scary. Being stern and strict with him is scary. But he will NEVER learn unless you take control of the situation. 

You say he cheated on you with his ex? That’s not OK. If he still believes that you need to make his insecurities ok for him - there’s your answer…Because grown men DON’T ACT THAT WAY. A grown man accepts his mistakes and moves on. But after all his errors in judgment, he’s still emotionally blackmailing you. So it’s now more clear than ever to me: you can either choose to give him the lecture… or you can ignore and go into no contact.

Phrases like “I need reassurance” are a TELLTALE SIGN that he wants you to solve his problem. You can’t, even if you wanted to. And you shouldn’t want to. The only appropriate response is to say: “Reassurance?! After all the shit that you pulled?! GROW THE F*** UP!” That should be the emotion in your mind. If you can say it in those words - great. Whatever words you choose, you need to get in touch with your anger. I promise, standing up for yourself will feel good. Like ripping a band-aid: you only have to do it once, and the pain is gone. 

Remember: emotional blackmail is not OK. It’s immature. I almost laughed when you wrote the word “reassurance”. The fact that he just expects you to bail him out is incredible. This is not a man whose feelings you should be considering at all. Because he’s not considering yours. He keeps saying things like “because of you”, as though he has no free will of his own. So, either you go into no contact, or you give him a Royal ass-kicking over the phone. Him saying “I’m a jealous person” is NOT YOUR PROBLEM. Especially after his piece of shit behaviour! If you must have that conversation - do it. But let it be the last one. He is even worse than I thought. Or simply ignore. And stop going on his Instagram and Facebook. Just don’t check it. Exclude him. Those are your two choices. But to LISTEN to his bullshit about how YOU must consider his “fragility”….. no. That is the last thing you should be doing."

So yeah i dont want him to shift the blame on me again, i still havent put his message on “read” yet. Can i just block him and not respond to the message i talked about earlier?

"You’re doing great. In fact, each detail you provide actually shocks me a little bit more. For example, he is the one who unfollows you everywhere first… then he COMPLAINS that you don’t chase him: that is a new low. I’m having trouble remembering the last time a man had this little self-respect. Seriously, as serous as I can say it: you’re really better off without. He needs to find his own source of strength. Otherwise, he will bring both of you down - which he has already been successfully doing. It makes me happy that you could follow through on no-contact: not many people can at your age. It really takes courage. I’ve been having similar discussions with a friend who is 28, and it wasn’t easy for her either - it was a huge mess. But if you stick with it now, you’ll develop a good habit much earlier than many of us did (including myself).

By the way, where are you guys from? This is helpful to understand the culture of gender relations and ownership in your particular case. Different cultures accept a different level of possessiveness as “normal”. For example, if you have Asian roots (e.g. Pakistan), it’s more understandable, because men get treated as “special” there. However, if you’re French or German or Polish - then it’s a different story.

Also, what words did he use when he said that you “shouldn’t do silent treatment”? Did he talk in a recommending tone, did he plead, or did he simply block you everywhere and then begin to complain that you’re wrong? All three variants are bad, but some are worse than others… Bottom line remains the same though. He needs to grow up fast. I would ask him “How dare you even talk to me? Go away. We’re finished.” Or simply ignore (they go away faster that way)"	Timely-Twist-3583	reply	na	na	na	0.9985062479972839	weak	strong	no	na	relationships

That’s no problem, happy to help. I can understand better now. I’ve worked with many people from the Philippines - some of the best people in the world. Not as cynical as people in Europe (I’m from Russia). Remember, the most important thing: consistency. Stick with it. Patience wins everywhere - be it the stock market or fitness or relationships. Nothing beats patience. You know everything you need to know now, so nothing should surprise you. Just ignore and that’s it. In my culture, things would already be long over. This is just to give some perspective: you come from a very kind place, so you suffer a little more with these things. No need to. Just continue the silent treatment, you’ll be feeling great soon, with a sense of achievement that you did this. Your ego will be restored. Good luck!

"We got to know each other and went on dates, until now it's almost 7 years.

3 years ago I (22f) had to separate from him for my study aboard. He became extremely moody about it sometimes, despite our schedules were both really really busy, and because of that he didn't see my message for many times, yet he still somehow got the thought that he was sad because I could not stay by his side physically, and he said he was scared of one day he might lose his feeling about me.

I don't exactly understand why he felt that way because I never had that experience before. I do missing him and our happy memories, but I just don't have any concerns like I could lose my love for him because of time and distance. I wear our ring everyday, that even made a white impression on my finger. Whenever I feel sad and exaggerated, I look at the ring that represent my boyfriend to ease the misery. He's the one who always makes me feel save and relief just by thinking of him, even when he doesn't stay by my side.

I am so sure and believe in our relationship, but what my boyfriend feel is just the opposite. I tried to cheer him up by talking to him, texting him, sending him photos. After that he said I didn't need to care about it because he would be OK soon. But I'm starting to worry because this isn't the first time I try to cheer him up from the same reason. Texting, photos it's just not enough for him.

I can only meet up with him 2 times a year because if it's more than that then the travel expenses (12hrs flight) will be financial problem to me. I still got 3 years ahead to finish my bachelor. 

Tl;dr: I've heard many couples broken up because one of them had to study aboard, I'd thought that's a bullsh*t reason. But now I'm pretty uncomfortable to think this ridiculous story might happen to me. I don't want to loose my boyfriend, I need to do something different but I can't figure out what should I do.

"As someone who tried to do long distance during my bachelor's, I definitely recommend breaking up.  


We went through the same situation you describe. Pictures, videos, many hours of video chatting, and a couple of visits but each of those just made it harder. Especially the visits. They were reminders of how nice it was to be together...  


Trying to maintain someone's happiness from so far away takes so much away from your university experience, go have fun, drink, party, and make new friends without having to worry about someone that you can't see. The vast majority of couples in my university either broke up or ended up cheating. The reality is you guys will grow up so much that the odds of still being together are slim.  


If you guys truly mean a lot to each other you will see each other again for sure. I can tell you in my case we have met 4 times in 4 different countries. It just didn't work out between us  


I understand this isn't the advice you were looking for, but all I can tell you is that you both need to figure out what you need out of this relationship.

"I (23f) think I'm going to finally break up with my bf (32m). We live together. I also  have terrible rsd so this is going to be extremely painful, and my first ever break up where I'm consciously not going to jump straight into another relationship afterwards in order to stop myself from feeling heartbroken. I'm trying to be a better person...

Anyways, I live with him in Scotland, but my whole family and support system is in Ireland. I moved out of Ireland because I could never really see myself living here permanently, but I do of course miss my family and friends. I went to uni in Scotland and just ended up staying afterwards. My dilemma is whether to stay in Scotland after the break up or go back to Ireland.

 I recently got a nice job offer in Scotland, starting next month, for at least 3 years. I still don't know what I want to do on my life, and this job seemed like a good starting block to figuring it out. So if we break up, do I stay there, find a room to rent for a good bit of money (yay Edinburgh) and start my new job in September?

On the other hand, I could move back in with my parents in Ireland. I could get a job in a pharma company here without an issue, as it's a huge sector here and I have a relevant course completed. By moving back, I could save a good amount of money but I will also feel like I took a step back in my life, instead of forward, if that makes sense? My parents have no problem with me moving back here - in fact, they always wanted me to come back to Ireland after uni. 

If anyone has any great words of wisdom, I would be forever grateful.

"I've been with my bf for 3 years and I can never decide if I want to become more serious or not. Is it possible to have a really great, positive, healthy partner, but just not like them as a person enough?

My bf is a walking contradiction.  Sometimes, he does anything to make me smile.  He can be very in tune with my feelings, and act on them to make sure my needs are met.  He can be respectful, secure, stable, flexible, mature when needed.  He keeps me stable.  I trust him. He's logical and honest. He lets me be independent. We have similar lifestyles and mentalities on many things. With him, I love and accept myself more. I relax more. I laugh more.

Other times, he couldn't care less. He can be oblivious or indifferent. He forgets anniversaries and birthdays. He scrolls on his phone instead of being present with me. He will do what I want to appease me bc he ""doesn't care"".  He says that about everything.  ""I don't care"", so it just ends up being my way. Which, I love getting my way on things, but I'd also like a partner who I felt was actively engaged with me and has more date ideas than just co-op video games (I enjoy video games, but it's not my only hobby). He does care about the bigger things, though.  But still, I want to sense the emotion behind it, the genuineness, the warmth. And I rarely do.

I can be mean to his face and he just laughs.  And I don't even feel bad doing it bc that's just our dynamic. He is mean to my face and laughs about it, too.  He loves to annoy me or my cat bc he finds our reactions funny. Sometimes it's fun and light. Other times I find it off-putting. I do feel lucky though that someone who has good social skills accepts me for being blunt and inconsiderate myself.  I usually don't mean to be rude, but I just am by accident.  Meanwhile, he and his family know they're rude, they just don't care, they find it funny.  But they also know how to be considerate and have good social skills when needed.

I just go in circles lol I want a partner I adore and love and want to be present for and want to compromise for.  Someone I feel proud and excited about. Someone I'm sure about. But with him, it is so easy and nice, he's a good balance for me, and I always hear how hard relationships are, how hard dating is, and so I think, why would I give something so good and easy up? His presence in my life makes my life better.  At times, he can be a picture perfect partner. What if I'm just completely numb and detached to everyone and I just can't see how good I have it?

Now, we are moving in together and I'm so confused.  I never wanted to move in or deepen our relationship.  But I'm not 100% confident in breaking up with him either and we were at a crossroads  I'm angry, depressed, and in denial.  My move in date is literally less than 2 weeks away and I keep thinking if I don't think about it, maybe it won't happen.  It feels like my life is just happening to me.  Idk what to do. Sometimes I feel so upset that I'm moving out of a place I love and doing all this hard work moving for him when I'm not even excited or confident in him/us and wasting both of our times.  Other times I think, I need to do this to get more clarity.  I have to at least try it. I don't want to lose him as a friend. It's just a year, it's just a move, I'm never stuck, it'll be fine for now. I already told everyone I'm doing it and I'm not doing anything to stop it, so I guess it's going to happen.

Tl;dr: Can't tell if I'm deluding myself into liking and committing myself to someone I don't even like or if I'm just being way too picky and delusional about the dating pool itself and I should instead have a gratitude oriented mindset that I have someone who accepts me, helps me feel more confident, and stable etc."	Confused-5431	post	24.990713733422407	female	White	0.0027552626561373472	na	na	na	5	relationships

"We've been exclusive for over 3.5 years, we're both in our mid 20s. Yesterday he was trying to show me a post he had saved on instagram and I saw a post saved there that was just nudes. I asked him who it was then and he said he didn't know. I just thought ""ok, we all watch porn"" but was a little peeved. Hours later, I asked again to see the post and through my own research found out this is a local musician girl who he played a show with 2.5-3 years ago. He says he didn't remember her or playing a show with her, that he just though it was a local musician and saw boobs and then stupidly click save, then didn't remember the post was there until I saw it, and that he doesn't use that instagram account that much. I don't know what to do. I don't think he's cheating, we spend most of our time together. It just feels weird that he saved a naked post of a girl he knows, then said he didn't remember who it was or that he played a show with her, even though he has been following her on instagram?


I'm trying to figure out how to trust him and move past it but it just feels awful. I don't know what to do.

"when you find saved thirst traps, “i don’t know who that is/i don’t remember” is probably the top excuse next to “she’s a childhood friend” and “idk how that got there” 

don’t be gullible, he remembers her. 
did you ask why he still follows her when he has nudes of her? 

if you confront him about it, don’t let him turn it around and talk about you being “insecure”. this is about him being pathetic. who saves nudes of a girl he couldn’t even get? creepy.

you trust him, (a lot. i can tell by the way you defend his actions) and he’s an asshole for taking advantage of that. my respect for him as a boyfriend would drop.

That’s fair. He’s not a musician full time and only plays 1-3 shows/year, all local and with local musicians.

I went to a party 2 days ago and one guy from previous work place was there at the party and I didn’t even talk to the guy not even a word. But I had a crush on this guy like 7 months ago and I told my boyfriend that the guy is at the party. My friends were like go talk to him(the guy from work) I said I have a boyfriend I’m not doing that! And I just sat in the corner looking at reels and texting my boyfriend how much I miss him the entire party and I texted my boyfriend even when I reached home I also sent him snaps from the train station! But my boyfriend got mad when I told him what my friends said about talking to the guy. I assured my boyfriend I didn’t talk to anyone and sat in the corner and I was texting my boyfriend the whole time and went home immediately in like 2 hours. But next day my boyfriend said how should I trust you? I don’t trust you or believe you that you didn’t do anything at the party and he also called me a sl*t and wh*re. And I LOST MY VIRGINITY TO MY BOYFRIEND. I’m a person who doesn’t even look at anyone else but my boyfriend. I’m so in love with him that I can’t even look at anyone else no matter who it is! My friends always tell me I’m super loyal. I was loyal even when I just started seeing my boyfriend that I stopped talking to this other boy I was talking to that time. My boyfriend’s friends told him I’m playing him and that I’m seeing multiple people. HIS FRIENDS HAVE NEVER EVEN TALKED TO ME OR MET ME! and he listened to his friends and not me. I am extra extra loyal and actually loved him and give him reassurance all the time! I’m heartbroken and don’t know what to do?

TL;DR: my boyfriend broke up with me because he doesn’t trust me because my friends are different and his friends told him that I’m playing him but they don’t even know me!"	Vast_Strawberry_9683	post	20.995371147732634	female	White	0.9982702732086182	na	na	na	2	relationships

"Is there anyone here that has a platonic friendship with their ex but is also in a relationship? 

My (22F) boyfriend (25M) has a platonic relationship with his ex. We’ve been together for 7 months now and I’m kind of afraid to ask him about it because i fear he’ll take it the wrong way. 
They were together for 4 years and they broke up almost 3 years ago now but they’re still in touch and they text from time to time and meet but not that often. However I don’t how to feel or what to think about it because I’ve never been in this kind of a situation before and it makes me feel very uncomfortable sometimes 
So I have a few questions that i would like to ask because i keep getting second hand answers that are not really the answers I’m looking for so i would really like to talk to someone first hand.

TL;DR: i would like someone that has a platonic relationship with their ex to answer these questions:
How do you perceive the connection with your current partner, do you compare it and feel like the connection is not as deep?
Do you think or hope that someday the relationship would be romantic again with better timing?
Would you marry someone that you don’t have such as a deep connection with or do you feel nobody could be as good?"	2upk0	post	27.71406683295376	female	White	0.6932463049888611	na	na	na	7	relationships
"So I fell in love with this dude. At the time that I caught feelings, we had known each other for about a year. They were intense feelings. Felt like he was the one and everything, which hadn’t happened before. 

Things happened, don’t need to go through the whole story, I moved away but we stayed in contact off and on. He dated after I left, I got involved with a guy, etc. 

I saw him last year for a brief visit. When I saw him, I didn’t have feelings. I didn’t feel anything other than hey, this is fun. I wasn’t in love anymore, I wasn’t self conscious. It just felt like I got to see an old friend. It was amazing to me that I could have such intense feelings for someone and they just disappeared, it was a good thing for me because he never liked me that way. So by losing those feelings, I could actually be genuine friends with him without worrying about my ulterior motives. 

So I now know it is possible to be actual friends with someone you used to be in love with. It takes time and space and sometimes it can take a lot of effort. But it is possible. 

The real question is here; you obviously are insecure about this connection he has and are worried about not measuring up to his ex. Have you ever asked him about his relationship with her? How it ended, why it ended? How do you think he’d respond to your fears? Would he reassure you and make an effort to be transparent about his current relationship with her?"	2upk0	reply	na	na	na	0.6932463049888611	no	strong	no	na	relationships
"So I can answer this a little indirectly.  My spouse is platonic friends with her ex.  His is her second closest friend.  My spouse and I have been together for almost 30 years and they have been close friends that entire time and has never been much of an issue for the three of us.  I can explain the circumstances and why I think it worked, but also I admit it's rare.

My Spouse (M) and her ex (S) got together their freshman year of university.  They both did gaming and I arrived at the university 2 years later.  (Went to a different school my first year).  M was overseas my first year so I didn't meet her then but I was into gaming so joined in the same social circle as S.  I met M when she returned the next year.  That November M and S broke up and Me and M started dating that January.  When they broke up S really wanted to remain friends.  And M agreed.  They really didn't work as a romantic couple and the only reason they remained together past the first 6 months was that they had a very strong friendship chemistry that kind of confused them.  They loved hanging out and spending time together.  S had trouble making friends so this was very important to him and he insisted he would work to mitigate the awkward as much as possible.  Things were awkward still when M and I started dating.  We had strong romantic chemistry.  So I can imagine how tough that must of have been for S.  But he never really made that our problem and since we were all in the same social circle we hung out together a lot.  And so I could see how M and S interacted.  They were close friends and I could see that, but I never thought she was romantically still interested in him, because she was very different with me, even different with me compared to how they were when I aw them as a couple.  There was some odd feelings for me in the first few months, mostly about how they would always have longer history or something but that kinda faded away after a few months.

So after M and S graduate he moves back to his home city and M remains with me in the city we went to university at.  They are still friends and from time to time she would visit him and it never bothered me.  This is were I know thing are different for other poeple.  I think it never bothered me because I had seen the two together before that a lot, and also some them together if I was also visiting down there (M's family was from the same area).  These visits continued even after me and M got married.

It did start to shift when S got married.  M was part of the wedding party but I think S's spouse became uncomfortable with it at one point.  Since that point M has never visited S on her own.  That jealousy seemed to mostly fade away eventually but cropped up again about 7 years ago when all four of us travelled overseas.  I think S talked to her about it and it got better.  We've see them every year though for the past 20 years as we go to the same gaming convention every year (baring that year we went overseas together and the COVID years).

Currently for me M's friendship with S is treated like her other close friendship with H, the woman she met in high school and they have been best friends ever since.  If M would do something with H, then I don't have a problem with her doing it with S.  I know for S he has more boundaries, he doesn't talk about his relationship with his spouse with M.  M doesn't mind and understands it's different for him and does not push.

So at this time S and M have been friends for over 30 years, and it's a source of happiness for both.  And now M has actually become pretty close the S's daughter who she got to spend time with during those convention trips I mentioned.  So I think there is value in remaining friends with an ex, but only if the circumstances can allow it to work.  Not all ex's are the same.

So, I think the reason this worked is this.  I saw them interact a lot.  I think I just don't feel as jealous naturally as some other people.  I think this runs on a spectrum for people.  M, my spouse, is similar.  I have had several female friends, not super close like her and S but close.  One M even suspected my have had a thing for me, but she never asked me to pull back.  In her mind it was on me to make sure nothing happened.  Also, I think M not making S's  different boundries a problem, because she understood that for him because his spouse is more jealous a different approach was required.

Thanks it, hope that helps."	2upk0	reply	na	na	na	0.6932463049888611	no	strong	no	na	relationships
"I talk with one of my exes. I gave her advice that led to her getting her current longterm boyfriend. She recommended a picture or two for my dating profile. There are some boundaries like how deep we might talk about stuff although neither one of us had to establish a boundary specifically. I don't ask about stuff that isn't any of my business or could affect current relationships. Currently single but was dating at one point. Nothing ended due to talking to an ex as far as I know, she talked to exes too.

I don't really like to compare people like that. In general I avoid comparing my current partner to a previous partner or other women. The question isn't necessary, ""who have I ever had the deepest connection with at its peak."" Having an ex or talking to them didn't affect how deep my connection was with a current partner. If I'm with someone that will be the deepest connection/relationship at the moment. When I break-up that connection is essentially downgraded.

I wouldn't date if I want to be with an ex or wasn't over them. I wouldn't date someone that wanted to be with someone else or wasn't over an ex.

I would only marry if I was absolutely in love and compatible with that person. That would include them being that best friend life partner deal.

You can talk to your partner about how he feels about his ex and what they talk about. Him having a deep connection in the past doesn't have to take away from the connection you two have now."	2upk0	reply	na	na	na	0.6932463049888611	no	strong	no	na	relationships
"Yes I remain friends with 2 serious EXes.  Has gotten closer over the years as friendship in middle age is more difficult.  Both feel more like sisters now with so much shared history.

When hanging out always choose something obviously platonic like lunch, never drinks or dinner.  Life is easier and happier with a little up front effort."	2upk0	reply	na	na	na	0.6932463049888611	no	strong	no	na	relationships
"I have had a platonic relationship with all my exes, excluding one. For about a year after the breakup, usually there has been little or no contact. Afterwards it's just meeting up and chatting, as we have shared experiences and we know each other's friends and family. It's like having an old friend. We don't meet up often, but get in touch every so often, maybe to chat about places to go on holiday, work stuff or recommendations.

I don't compare exes. It doesn't even come into it, they're all different people and we were different ages, so it's more like they were a period of my life that is over. I'd never get back with an ex. Definitely would never want to, it would be weird. Occasionally one might say or do something which will remind me why we broke up, but oddly enough I don't think I've ever had the thought come up of why we were together in the first place.

With my current partner, I feel that this is who I want to be with, and that is why I'm with them. Obviously you don't go into a relationship looking for your next ex, so each time it feels like this is the final chapter of my dating life and I'm ready to start a new book with this person I am with. I am not the same person who I was with with my previous exes, and I don't want to go back there. I'm making my future life for myself right now, and I want my current partner in it.

With each relationship I learn more about myself and how to recognise and communicate my needs. This means that the latest relationship is nearly always the deepest (when that hasn't been true, it hasn't lasted long). Whilst I might have married someone in my past, again I wouldn't go back (I wouldn't want to go back).

My relationship with my exes has no bearing on my current relationship, save for the things I have learned and the ways I have changed through having them in my life. I don't really properly remember how I felt at the time I was in those relationships, save for general 'good' or 'bad'- although I am aware of how much they mattered to me when I was at that age. 

I would hope my current partner does not compare themselves to an ex of mine. I wouldn't want them to be influenced by what they think I want. I want my current partner the way they are now.

"So I (29M) met this girl (23F) on hinge at the beginning of May. We had a first date at a restaurant and slept together the same night. We both said we wanted to take things slow but agreed to see each other again. Fast forward to now and we’ve been seeing each other continuously around once a week and sleeping together everytime (with a 5 week break in between where we both went on separate holidays).

At the beginning, communication in between dates was pretty much non existent apart from setting up dates. It’s gradually increased where by she sends a couple of low effort texts a couple times a day. However for me this really seems to trigger me. Historically I’ve always dated girls who’ve wanted to text me, tell me what’s going on in their life, things that have happened in the day etc. All she seems to text is sending me a funny video or writing 1 or 2 word responses and that’s only ever in response to text I send. It’s not that I’m wanting her to constantly text me every second but a bit more effort in the texts she does send or a quick “how is your day” would go along way. I feel there’s such a lack of effort from her part in communicating to me when we’re apart that it feels like she doesn’t care.

On top of this, she never asks me to meet up. It’s always me initiating and asking her when I can see her.

Im fully aware that people have different communication styles but her lack of effort/enthusiasm in reaching out to me and trying to see me makes me feel like she doesn’t really care that much. I raised this to her about a month ago and she said she acknowledges my feelings and will take it on board. To this date, texting has increased however the quality of the texts has not and she’s still made no effort to reach out to see me and instead waiting for me to ask. I also noticed that she’s been updating her Hinge location recently, which means she’s still active on it. Fair enough, we haven’t spoken about being exclusive but having dates for so long since May, just adds to the feeling of her not being that serious about us.

However on the other hand, when we’re together, she’s very affectionate and will always agree to see me, usually once a week (I wish it would be more). We also just went on our first holiday together abroad for 4 days and had a great time. Whiles on holiday she hinted at me (for the second time) and asked if we’re going to be in an official relationship. I just replied of course I see us in the future being together. She’s also introduced me to her friends and told her siblings about me.

I know it’s been a while since we started dating but at the beginning we really did take it slow and also had a bit of a break whiles we were on our seperate holidays. I really just don’t want to make things official if I feel the enthusiasm/effort/communication/seriousness from her side is not there. Maybe we just have different styles in communication or maybe she’s just unsure how she feels?

Friends I’ve discussed this with say that if she’s willing to go on holiday with me, see me regularly and be affectionate towards me that should be enough and that the rest will come when I make it official. However in the past with girls that’s always been there before I’ve made it official. 

I’m so confused, because on the 1 hand I love spending time with her and I want her to be mine. But on the other hand something just feels off and I don’t want to commit to her until I feel like it’s right and I’m comfortable.

Should I commit or talk to her about it? If so what do I even say?

Tldr; Dating a girl from Hinge since May. We meet weekly, have a good time, but her texting is low effort and she rarely initiates. Unsure if her enthusiasm matches mine.

"I'm so sorry. Heartbreak fucking sucks, and you're co-workers on top of that, *and* she's dating another co-worker? That's rough. On the bright side, it's pretty unlikely that they'll last. Rebounds rarely do, and dating co-workers is often a messy nightmare, for precisely this reason.

Honestly, I'd look for another job. If you can afford it, take some time off, go somewhere relaxing, maybe just go home, but the sooner you get out of the environment they're in, the sooner you can start to heal. Go no contact for your own sanity. Try to have as little to do with them as possible. She's hurt you and lied to you, and while she doesn't owe you anything, it's incredibly shitty to start a new relationship right in your face like that and have it affect your work life. Maybe ""calling her out"" wasn't the smartest move, but it sounds like she's treated you pretty badly, and trust me, I went through a similar situation recently and I understand the impulse.

I've known people who've been hurt by a relationship and moved to another country. Some of them seem okay, others seem like they're just lost. Walking calmly away from your problems and keeping a dignified distance is one thing, sprinting full-pelt and going soul searching in Vietnam or Chile is another.

"My boyfriends sister is overly involved in our relationship

My boyfriend (31M) and me (27F) have been dating now for 5 years and are now discussing marriage. We’re both South Asian but grew up in the US.

My boyfriends sister (27F) has consistently caused rifts and has been overly involved in our relationship for the last 5 years. From reading our texts, opening my presents to him to offering opinions on how “her” family operates she has done it all over the years. I’ve cried because of the way she’s spoken to me and my boyfriend has tried his best to address the issues we’ve had and stepped in as much as he can. 

This last weekend, she unprovoked went off on the both of us about how our PDA, the most of which has been his hand being on my leg, is something she gracefully tolerates and if we were ever to kiss (peck) in front of her she would never speak to us again. This is a strict boundary / value for her and she would never ever be ok with it so we need to follow it. She yelled at us for over an hour to the point where her friends and family asked her to stop repeatedly but she was too drunk to realize it. Keep in mind over the last 5 years my boyfriend and I have kept each other in check and are very aware about our PDA to the point where I’m scared to act normally around him when she’s around. 

She’s over the years also made comments on our relationship calling it names, and consistently has disrespected me by being cold and then blaming it on an excuse such as being tired, annoyed etc and then apologizing. She did the same regarding the PDA blowup but I don’t think I have any forgiveness left in me due to how harshly she has treated me for the last 5 years. WTF do I do to move forward in this situation? Is it insane to consider ending this relationship due to these accumulated issues that don’t seem to be getting better?

TLDR: boyfriends sister is causing me repeated stress due to her opinions and boundaries in my relationship. What do I do?"	Mysterious-Belt-7365	post	40.798961451365386	female	White	0.9991359114646912	na	na	na	20	relationships

"You should have kissed him that second. Maybe you'd have some peace and quiet for a while. 

In all reality, it doesn't sound like anyone is actually stopping her. I'm not sure why no one actually told her ""that's enough"". Or even tell her to leave. She sounds unhinged. 

I think you're at a point where you should no longer visit the home where she's at and uninvite her from your own home, permanently. If she's going to be at an occasion, don't go. Both of you. If she makes that a problem, someone needs to tell her that she's disrespectful and you no longer wish to see her or speak to her.

"
I feel insecure about our relationship because of many reasons - he had sex with a friend he’s had for years (who also was friends with both of his exes) and was still talking to her during our relationship but she sorta cut him off. He also liked a picture of a meme posted by her where she was saying that she was hot and stuff.

He had a female best friend he was cuddling with and also sleeping in the same bed with while we were dating who I later found out was someone he wanted to have sex with and they made out a couple of times 1-2 months before he met me. They are no longer friends as well after a long and messy incident but I had to fight for boundaries and defend myself a lot during those times.

When he was drinking alone at home, he messaged me and I was out but I was replying to him. The next day I went out on a date with him and while showing me something on IG, I saw that he had his inbox full of girls from the night prior. He was texting them while drunk and telling me they were just friends and that he was just feeling chatty. He only initiated conversations with girls despite having male friends as well.

I also recently found out that he has only talked about me to his group of friends where he is the only guy one time - when we started dating. We have been dating for almost a year (about 11 months) and when we are out on dates, he fails to mention me to them. Or when I asked a question to one of the girls (a link for a product they are using), he didn’t mention my name. One night when we were out the girl messaged him wanting to vent and he said he was outside and busy but not busy with me. He has another group of friends that he talks about me a lot to like when we are out or together but he says it’s because “they ask about you and talk about you”

He says I’m special and none of these were intentional and that I am important to him. I am the only one he talks to about everything in his life and he is most comfortable with me. The thing is - I feel insecure still. I don’t know what it is but a lot of these feel to me like I an not really important because of how I operated in the relationship. He is important to me so I bring him up a lot with friends - male or female. I don’t have the desire to drunk text anyone else but him, or just texting in general apart from my closest group of friends.

He says it’s only because the girls never ask about me so he never thought to bring me up to them. I don’t know anymore if my insecurity is irrational or is it because my trust has been so damaged. 

Now I ask to see his messages, I ask for frequent updates, and am anxious a lot but he has changed and is trying to make changes. He tweets about me now and is trying to bring me up more with his female friends and says to stop liking girl’s selfies or says that he’d start interacting with them less.

TL;DR Is my insecurity something that can only be cured by therapy? Am i still rational? I feel like I’m not special when I see how he forgets me when talking to other girls and I just know it’s not true and I’m cool too but my self esteem is kinda tanking."	icca1019	post	20.20056919839985	female	White	0.012492404319345951	na	na	na	1	relationships

"So just for some background I am a university student majoring in music. I’ve gotten pretty close with the others in my curriculum over the past year. There is one guy who I met through a mutual friend & we became pretty close over the semester. It was really nice to have another close friend but the more and more I kept hanging out with him the more I realized something was wrong. He started criticizing my performances for my music class, and criticizing the way that I dress. I would get pretty upset with him because I dress just like everyone else and there are even days when I dress up. he always brushes it off as if I’m being too sensitive so I decided to just let it go. Then one day he approached me about changing his major to mine, and suddenly wanted to be apart of my musical performances and claimed that he always had the passion. Through coming closer, he found out that I was involved in a hip hop dance crew at my university then expressed that he also wanted to join. There’s nothing wrong with being inspired by your friend, so I didn’t pay much attention to it. Then when it came time to pick our classes he picked his schedule then days later told me he changed it. This change included him switching into 3 out of 5 of my classes. One of which is not required for our major. Then he found out that I was going to a series of cheerleading open gym tryouts at my university’s with 2 of my other friends, and suddenly expressed interest in going. 

Eventually I started noticing that this was getting a little strange. I understand being inspired by your friend but it was becoming a little strange to me that he was suddenly interested in everything I was doing. A few weeks later, a friend of mine told me to watch out as he had confided in him that he liked me. I am in a relationship, and do not have any sort of feelings for this friend and never have. But finding this out confused me, because this friend helped me get with my current boyfriend. Why would he help me get with my current boyfriend if he likes me?  But then very quickly after my boyfriend and I got together, my friend became very hostile towards me and giving me the cold shoulder. Needless to say, I am very confused with what’s going on here. Does he like me? Want to be me? Both? Neither?

He is definitely projecting something on to you and he is now stalking/shadowing almost everything you do. You should bring his schedule changes at school to the awareness of admin, and show how much he has shifted things around to follow you around and it's not okay. It is up to them to handle this, not you. They have permitted this issue unwittingly and are the only ones who can undo it. You do not need to confront this person yourself unless the situation escalates. Edit: Stop socializing with them, as well.

He wants to be with you. This isn’t that complicated or confusing. He only helped you get with your current bf because he was stuck playing the part of a friend and that’s what a friend would do but secretly he resented it and that’s why he’s also moody and distancing himself then suddenly trying to get close again. Keep your distance from him if you’re feeling uncomfortable. You don’t have to make any declaration, you can simply start distancing yourself from him and it can be as gradual or abrupt as you need to be. There is no real explanation required. The only thing I strongly recommend you do is that recognize when your personal boundaries are being crossed (like commenting on your attire) and that you nip it in the bud and actually address things on the spot when you feel uncomfortable by his actions: “OP, you need to dress better than this”, “actually, your comments about my appearance or choice of attire are not welcome and I won’t tolerate them. Either you respect that boundary or we can stop hanging out”. Be assertive, set clear boundaries and recognize when someone is doing something that makes you uncomfortable then address it appropriately.

"this is gonna sound like a gd soap opera so just stay with me: 
I (32f) was seeing someone (38M) let's call him, Rob, super casually. We were pretty good friends and then it got friendlier roughly two years ago. He never wanted to label it and I was down being casual because I had gotten out of a long term relationship and was just looking for a good time. Literally yesterday, found out that Rob has been seeing someone, let's call her Kat (37F) for the last 6 months. Kat and Rob have posted on social media about being each other's significant other (National Girlfriend Day was August 1st if you didn't know) and I just figured out that he blocked me from seeing any of that. 

A mutual friend of ours (well, just mine now) showed me everything and was shocked I didn't know because Rob hadn't been shy about showing Kat off on his social media. Rob and I messed around as recently as last week. I want to tell Kat what he's been up to because I know enough about her to know she also just got out of a terrible divorce where her husband was cheating on her. 

For context, Rob had brought Kat around before and we aren't exactly friends but I know enough to care about her. I have decided I'm going to try and tell her because I don't know if he's doing this with another person and she doesn't know. Should I not be getting more involved or am I actually doing the right thing here?

The emotional hurt it will cause her is not on you for telling the truth; she has a right to know; and eventually she is going to be hurt by him anyway & the more time she has invested in him, the worse it will be.

"i'm(23) in a relationship with a really great guy(25) and i've been with him for a few years. he's always been really understanding and patient with me, which has been really helpful for me as a very traumatized person with a lot of mental issues. i know i have issues identifying my own emotions and communicating them effectively because i am autistic. i'm also in a very stressful living situation with no income. i have a lot of things that make me reliant on people, and i am always thinking about it because i don't want anyone to feel like they have to take care of me. 

&#x200B;

at an increasing rate lately i've been running into a lot more situations where i don't know what to do anymore. it can start as something small like feeling bad about what i'm eating or something stupid in a video game, and it just spirals. it gets out of hand so fast that i don't even realize it until i can't do anything. i know i get self destructive, and when i hit this point i very seriously consider breaking off my relationship and all of my friendships just to isolate myself. 

&#x200B;

what i need help with is how i should handle these, and how i should communicate better with my partner about them. he's stressed out and its very obvious that he has lost his patience with me because he will snap at me. in recent instances he's threatened to just leave so i can cry alone, he's asked if we should just break up because i'm clearly unhappy with him and he feels like he just makes everything worse, and sometimes he'll just say some really not great things in the heat of the moment. it often feels like i'm purposefully misunderstood when i try to talk, but i also am aware that i will twist things when i'm in a bad spot to make myself feel worse. i feel guilty for feeling bad when he is trying so hard to help, and it makes me feel like i'm being manipulative. 

&#x200B;

i know i'm a pain to deal with. i know i'm not his responsibility. but i have trouble communicating what is upsetting me most of the time because i don't know what it is without some serious introspection (and sometimes even then i don't know the underlying reason). a lot of the time when i reach the point of being upset for hours on end, i'm nonverbal. i've had a lot of times where i've had to tell him i'm not his responsibility and that he doesn't have to put so much effort into me, and he always insists that he does it because he wants to—but then it always feel like i'm making him angry for being upset about things, even when i know i'm allowed to be. 

&#x200B;

i've tried talking to him while in this situation, but it turns into me feeling very dismissed or misunderstood. i've tried pushing those feelings down and pretending things are fine and that just upsets him too. and because he feels frustrated and upset about it, that just makes me feel more guilty and frustrated with myself. sometimes it feels like i need to punish myself just for being upset about something trivial. 

&#x200B;

i know a lot of this toxicity is coming from me. i know a relationship shouldn't feel like this, where i feel too scared to feel anything out of fear of upsetting him. and i know its unfair for him to feel like he has to tiptoe around everything to keep from upsetting me. 

&#x200B;

unfortunately therapy isn't an option for me right now, and i haven't had success with therapy in the past. the things i try to suggest when we talk about it haven't seemed to help at all. i don't know what to do anymore. i don't know what else i can try besides just giving up and breaking up. is there anything i can do to better communicate or to handle these kinds of situations better?

&#x200B;

TLDR: i keep having breakdowns and getting upset, and i don't know why most of the time. i don't know how to communicate with my partner about how to handle it or work through it, and it is turning into both of us feeling very apprehensive around one another because of it. i don't know what other approach i could try besides just giving up on all of my relationships because i know i am a burden to deal with.

My grandpa has been caring for my grandma who has dementia since 2021. But sometimes, he takes his stress out on me. Here’s the best way I can put it: 
He nitpicks on everything I do. Everything. I wanted to donate one of my cars to the local school (the title is in my name) and he went off on me, because it wasn’t “common sense” to do that. 

He’s been doing that 2x a week since April, and it caused me to just explode after holding in my pain for so long. I tried so hard to pretend like I was fine that I eventually just blew up. When I finally said “You’re stressed, and grandma needs to go to a nursing home so you can find balance in your life and stop taking everything out on me.” He went off on me. 

He told me how I had no right to say that, he’s doing the best he can, he doesn’t appreciate the lecture, etc. Just the absolute meanest things he could think of. It will never make sense to me how I’ve taken so much shit from him since 2021 and I say one thing and he blows up. 

And some would say that I’m disrespectful to my elders, however I willingly sat in the COVID ICU with my grandma last year when she had no one else. (Please keep in mind as you read this, my parents live out of state and she’s my step-grandma. Her kids from her first marriage don’t help her at all). 
I feel like I’m overreacting but I’m heading to the point where I’ve wished more than once to just go to sleep and never wake up so I don’t have to deal with this situation anymore.

It’s really tough to care for someone with Alzheimer’s. It’s this constant heartbreak to realize that they are forgetting everything (and even eventually you). And right now she is his world.

I think you need to separate the problems. For the nitpicking, you should probably have a heart to heart about that. It could just be that he’s trying to have any kind of normal conversation. It could be that he’s a nitpicky guy. I think you should tell him that it’s bothering you - but then also, just kinda say “Thanks for your opinion” and do what you want anyways.

For the stuff re: your grandma - maybe you can look into community supports. My aunt with Alzheimer’s recently started an outpatient program with a home. She goes there a couple of days a week for programming, which gives my uncle a much needed break. As a part of the deal, she will eventually move in there when there is space available - which gives them both a transition period to get used to the idea.

"We’ve been dating for several months and live an hour apart. He is divorced, for about 3 years now. Things between us are good but some things that have happened have me wondering. 

His ex wife (40F) has severe depression, and from what he said it was a bad pairing. They were married for about 10 years. They fought often, she’d kick him out often, dead bedroom, etc. IMO it sounded toxic AF. They decided to try to be friends post divorce. The divorce was amicable, there were no children and no property to divide. 

At a point she declared she didn’t want to be in contact with him for 30 days. Eventually she got back into contact with him. She blamed it on her mental state, and they continued the friendship. 

A few months ago while we were dating, she did it again. Gave him a 30 day span where she didn’t want contact. His grandma was dying at the time and he didn’t take her ask very well, due to the general circumstances. He did respect her wishes. He did not take his grandma dying well at all. 

A few weeks after his grandma died, his ex wife texted him to stop by in the evening while I was visiting him. I cut my visit short so he could go. While driving back I got a distraught call from him, she was home but refused to open the door. He was upset and mad at her. A week or so later she shows up at his job, and he read her the riot act. She apologized. Since then they text occasionally but nothing more that I know of. 

Tonight he was texting me and I answered back. Then nothing. He didn’t respond for over an hour which is unusual. When I called after I got home, he had been at her house watching TV with her. I don’t feel good about this. 

He has tentatively talked about moving to my area as he thinks ‘I’m the one’…but I’m not so sure. I think he’s got a ex he can’t and doesn’t want to shake. He brought up me meeting her but after everything that happened a few months ago, I really don’t want to.

They're divorced. There's no kids. There's no lingering property or assets that they co-own. There's no reason he should be this invested in her life. Sure, she may have severe depression but she should be seeing medical professionals for that, not calling on her ex to help her through her struggles when she feels like it.

Do yourself a favor. Look up ""sunk cost fallacy"" and then take some time to decide if a relationship with both of them is what you want.

Hi, I'm a 24 year old female here for a bit of advice. I met Joe (24  M) on Tinder and we hit it off. A month later, I confessed I might start to have feelings for him as I was genuinely into him. We just had so much in common. We spoke the same language, we had little inside jokes, we spoke every single day, we coudnt wait to spend time together. We clicked really well. However when I confessed he made it clear he wasn't looking for a relationship as he wasn't over his ex. I respected his stance and we agreed to remain friends. Over the next few months we got super close. We spoke everyday, we spent hours together watching movies on his couch, we spoke about everything under the sun, we made plans every week. I haven't spent this much time with any of my other guy friends and made him a priority. It felt like a relationship just without any
intimacy. Maybe a part of me hoped he would eventually see what a great pair we made. I went out of my way to make him happy. I sent him food, invested my time and energy to meet him, traveled a lot just to see him for a short period, gave thoughtful little gifts and more. After a few months he confessed last week that he has fallen for my best friend whom he has met once. I'm broken. What can I do? I don't want to loose the friendship but I feel so hurt.

So I've been dating my boyfriend for 7 months. I really do like him and I personally feel like he shows his affection through actions (acts of service). So far I haven't minded that he doesn't compliment or tells me he likes me but now that we're around 7 months of dating, I'm just thinking it's odd that you can't tell your girlfriend that you like her or compliment her. He follows some pages on Facebook where half naked girls are posted and he's got no issues saying they're good looking. Sometimes I'll tell him that I like him or that he's looking good today and he'll just respond with ""thank you"", ""that came out of nowhere"" or just not answer at all. I've brought this up a couple of days ago and he just said that he wouldn't be with me if he didn't like me, he wouldn't be spending all his weekends with me either. He said that's also not something that he says so he'll probably never say it (or saying that he loves me) and not expecting him to say it either. I told him it would be nice to hear it once in a while and he told me not to worry about his feelings towards me and that he's just an odd person in general. I feel like it doesn't help that he's not a physical person either and doesn't like kissing so we never kiss unless we make out.

I'm just having a hard time understanding this cause in my mind if you like someone, you want to tell them, no? I'm not expecting him to tell me every single day but hearing it once in a while would be nice. Is this a red flag that I'm overlooking?


TLDR; I've been dating my boyfriend for 7 months and he never once complimented me or says he likes me. He's not physical either so sometimes I feel like I'm more like a friend than a girlfriend.

Sounds like he's not a good match for you. It is an issue that he has no problem complimenting on Facebook, but can't bring himself to tell you a nice word or kiss you. Regardless of why he's doing it, why keep being in your head against the wall with him? Kim saying he's just an odd person isn't really an answer... He's not telling you the real reason, right? It could be that he likes to withhold affection from people he dates in order to keep them guessing/begging, or that he grew up in a family where that was not customary and he's deeply uncomfortable with it, or that he really is settling for you.

"I (I’m 38f) he’(41m) was with my ex for 15 years. Most Everything was fine- I think we had normal like disagreements and ups and downs- for the most part as in we got along great, always traveling together, having lots of good times together.
1 broke up with him out of no where after his mother asked me in a Skype call hey when are you and my son going to finally get married - something about the way she asked triggered me like hey when are we going to get married? I have heard over the years people ask this and it made me so sad knowing that I have brought it up so much and there was just no real response. I struggled for so many years to get him to talk about anything serious or even bother to express any concerns or deeper thoughts. I'm 38 now. I wanted kids and wanted to get married. He has never allowed us to have a serious conversation. He had never said I love you once until I broke up with him 4 months ago.  We didn't have sex for about the last 3 years and he told me after the break up he was addicted to porn and had an intense fear of commitment and making decisions in general. We got engaged about 2 years ago and I stopped telling people once I realized he wasn't telling anyone. I had tried for many years to have more engaging and serious conversations with him, but he would shut down and just turn everything into a joke- although it was fun it was not satisfying for me on a intimate level.
I asked and begged him for so many years to go to therapy to help him manage his emotions and anger a bit and now he's finally going after I break up with him. I feel so frustrated and do miss him and I know everything could be fine again- but also I feel resentment towards him like why do I have to go to so many years without getting what I wanted and all of the sudden he's read and now I'm just supposed to just now start working on us and each other now.  
I’m lmost 40 now. But at the same time, sometimes I feel I can give him another chance, does resentment go away- will I be able to forgive him?

Even if he's working on those things, if you get back together you are going to fall RIGHT BACK into the old patterns of behavior, I guarantee it. 

I can understand that you feel like you put all this work into him and now that he's MAYBE starting to improve it's unfair that you don't get to reap the benefits but that just isn't how it is - it's not how relationships work, and the damage is more than done.

"TL;DR: I am struggling with insecurities regarding my looks and I consider my gf to be more attractive than me. I am not sure how to deal with the issue and I am considering breaking up with her so I can work on it by myself but I really love her and I don't actually want to leave her for any other reasons, I feel like I will ruin the relationship if I stay anyway.

&#x200B;

I started seeing my gf about 8 months ago and we have been official for about 5 months. I've always struggled with body image issues but I went to therapy for a long time and I was able to work through a lot of it. However, these are things that can easily come back. In general I feel like I am attractive but not as much as my gf, she gets a lot of compliments when we go out and gets hit on by men very often. I don't care that people say stuff to her because we're both lesbians and I know she won't go through with anything (even if it's a woman). So my worry is not her cheating or something like that, it's more so that I never get this kind of attention, I never really have.  
I am heavier than her, she's never shown any dislike for my body and I don't really think I need her to be more reassuring because she always tells me I look good or that she thinks I'm beautiful, etc. My real issue is I just think she is quite literally the beauty standard and while I feel okay about my looks seeing her is a constant reminder that I will never look like that. I wish this wasn't an issue for me and generally speaking I don't think it should be, I think it's unfair to her and I don't really feel comfortable telling her how I feel. I think this is grounds for her to break up with me as well so I'm not really sure what the best thing to do is.  
I really love her and we have an amazing relationship, she likes my friends and I like hers and our personalities mix really well together but I have been struggling with this and she doesn't really know, other than this issue I think we have a pretty healthy relationship. Even if I compare myself to her a lot and feel a little envious I have never made any mean comments about this, in fact we went out Saturday night and this was bothering me all night to the point where I wanted to say something but I stopped myself. Again I just don't really know what the right thing to do is, I already contacted my therapist and asked to schedule a session. I am not sure I will have the ability to overcome this soon enough while in the relationship but I don't have any other reasons to want to breakup with her, I am really happy otherwise and she is a great partner."

"The other day, my best friend brought up how she thinks I should have a conversation with this girl I don’t like. Let’s call her Hannah. Hannah previously dated my BF(years ago) and has been dating someone new for 2 years. Her new bf just so happens to be good friends with my bf and some people in my close friend group. Hannah and her bf used to come around our friend group until she was getting very inappropriate and disrespectful towards me. 

A few examples are: whenever she would be around my bf, she would comment to me saying how cute he is, how much she loves him, etc. Then I caught her sitting on my bfs lap one time, she also will constantly have her arm around his shoulders. She also made several inappropriate sexual comments to him IN FRONT of me. The final straw was she pulled me aside one time to ask how our relationship is and questioned me on what “we even do for fun together” and then proceeded to try and get info on our relationship. 

I told my bf a year ago that I was done hanging out with her. He agreed and is on my side 100%. I don’t feel the need to have a “heart to heart” with her and let her know she bothers me. I feel like it will give her power over me and I’ll be seen as a weak, jealous girl. I’d rather just ignore her, and act unbothered. I do sometimes run into her at group events and I’m always cordial. 

My best friend however was saying she thinks I need to tell Hannah how I feel because I can’t avoid her forever. I understand that, but none of the girls in our group like her. We feel bad for her boyfriend because he is really sweet, but we cannot stand Hannah. She’s not a girls girl. My friend apparently feels bad for leaving them out of group situations and was kind of blaming me for it. She says they’re questioning why they haven’t been invited to as many things. 

I feel hurt by her making a request to me. I don’t want to be Hannah’s friend regardless if I tell her how she’s made me feel in the past. I don’t want to mend things with her. 

My best friend is threatening to tell Hannah herself because she feels caught in the middle, even though I’ve never asked her to not invite them places. 

How do I handle this situation?

Tl;Dr my best friend wants me to have a hard conversation/mend things with my enemy so she feels better about the situation."	ThrowRA8164819	post	17.64799673477803	female	White	0.9992744326591492	na	na	na	2	relationships

Your friend is welcome to hang out with Hannah on her own. It's your choice whether you decide to make amends with Hannah or not, or invite her to your socials.

Just know that it sounds like the way you're treating Hannah seems to be influencing your relationship with your best friend, but as long as you know the consequences of different options you take, we're not really in a position to say what you should choose."

"I’ve been having quite a rough time this last year & i’m starting to go crazy, constantly otherthinking, lonely and upset. 

So last year me and my partner were together for roughly 2 years, she broke up with me because she didn’t see a future together. I later found out that she had been actually sleeping with my best friend of 24 years, not just once either - for a whole year. I was betrayed by them both, and 2 of my close friends knew about it the whole time and they didn’t tell me. That fucked me up, it still does to this day. 

A few months later I started dating a woman I knew, everything was going so great. Constant texting for weeks and weeks then we finally met up but after a week she called it off. She didn’t really give me a reason, but she had just come out of a 5 year relationship so what I can gather is that I was a re-bound. Okay so that sucked but it’s fine, i’ll take a break & heal. Probably too early for me to start dating anyway, but it just happened. 

5 months later I meet a woman off tinder, we date for 3 months & then we make it official, 3 months later she dumps me. Her reasons were because she doesn’t think we are compatible, I later found out she was actually cheating on me with her ex, who she still worked with. They were back in a relationship the day we split up. Okay another blow, this one doesn’t bother me as much as i’m already pretty damaged from before. & Also the relationship wasn’t great I knew it wasn’t going anywhere, I just went along with it because we was having fun at the time. I’m glad it ended. 

2 months later, I meet the literal girl of my dreams. We hit it off and I really fall this time I didn’t get this feeling with anyone else before, this one is different. However she just came out of a 5 year relationship, still lives with her ex in an apartment but sleeps on the sofa, & she is very very close with her ex from before the recent one - who constantly texts her and asks to hang out, which she does. This stuff didn’t used to bother me but even before these last 3 girls I just spoke about, ex’s and male friends have been a constant repeating factor, & I can’t not get worried about them anymore, it keeps happening. Anyway so we’ve hung out a lot & had some really fun times but somethings changed & I can start to feel it shifting. I am expecting the “it’s not you, it’s me” text coming very soon. 

I’m not getting any reasons for what’s happening, it actually hurts so much more not knowing WHY they don’t want to be with me. I’d rather someone would just give me the reasons instead of the whole ‘trying not to hurt my feelings’. The not knowing is what keeps you up at night. 

I’m really at wits end & I don’t know what to do anymore, I just want to be happy with someone & I can’t seem to seal the deal. I don’t know what i’m doing wrong & nobody is telling me what i’m doing wrong! 

What am I supposed to do? I know maybe I should just take a break from women & focus purely on myself. But the thing is I am not actively looking for it, I just naturally end up getting into these situations, I like them, they like me and then ? I just don’t understand. I cry a lot these days, not even over the specific reasons of what’s happened, just everything is piling up and exhausting.

TLDR; Dated 4 women in 1 year, 2 cheated on me, 2 just failed dating. Don’t understand what i’m doing wrong & not getting any answers.

First, let me say I’m sorry for the frustration you’re feeling right now…and many of us know that frustration firsthand as well, so you’re not alone. More importantly, you’ve already brushed on the answer, though you’re having trouble accepting it…focus on yourself. Do things that make yourself proud, whatever that may be…and the satisfying relationships will follow. When you know your own self-worth and manifest it in outward confidence, the ladies will come knocking. Relationships should COMPLEMENT your life, not be the focus of it. Everyone gets involved in relationships for their own reasons, including you…and the cracks don’t usually show for a LONG time. Every one of the relationships you described are too short. We all know how amazing it feels when we meet a new person and things appear to be clicking…only to fall apart soon after…every one of us. Don’t beat yourself up about it and continue to focus on being the best version of yourself you can…soon you’ll be dismissing others that don’t fit what your looking for, or better yet, finding the right person for the new, confident person you are.

I’m in a similar boat as you, except I’m a 28F. I was in pseudo-relationship after relationship with men who didn’t want to commit to me. So I made a promise to myself to focus on me, not to even have casual sex, deleted all my dating apps. It’s so enlightening. I was not secure with myself and just with these men so I didn’t have to be by myself. People pick up on that kind of thing, even subconsciously, so I was attracting men who wanted to prey on that weak part of me. It’s been six months and I’m still healing.

"Sorry if this is a bit of a long one. I just need to see if it's all in my head or if I'm warranted in the way I'm feeling. 

I met an Australian farmer almost 4 years ago whilst backpacking. In that time we've been together, we've been a few hours away and we've been apart for a whole year when I went home to England during the pandemic. We spoke every day and it seemed perfect. I had no hesitation in making the move back over here to be with him when the borders opened back up and was so excited for our future. 

Fast forward a year and a half and we are living together (with a house mate also 36M). I'm on a student visa and have spent a lot of money on the course to enable me to stay in this country but still work towards (half) my life goals. I will need to study further to get to where I want to be but I couldn't afford the full degree with no student loans for international students.

So we are living together. He's great, he's awesome, he's kind, he's a farmer... He barely has time for himself let alone me. We have no quality time together. I feel like a 26 year old house wife. I get minimal support in the house from him or his house mate. I spend most my free time tidying the house, cooking meals, looking after the pets and studying. But I still make time for him. I make time even to do the little things that I know make him feel loved, happy and appreciated. 

After having (minimal) conversations with him, it seems he's taken from that that helping cook the dinner one night or emptying the dishwasher is an act of love and appreciation or being a present partner. I just can't see that it is. I feel like I'm ready to just cut my loses, lose all this money I've spent on studying in this country and just go home to my family who I miss every single day. I feel so alone out here and like I have no one to fall back on. 

I am so aware of massive communication issues in our relationship and I am trying to get better at it myself but when I do get vulnerable and reach out he's not very receptive. He keeps so many things in his head and often makes plans and tells me about them at the last minute. 

I just feel lost and confused and I don't know what to do about it. He doesn't seem to get it and how could I expect him to when we are so awful at communicating. I am actually starting to miss our long and longer distance relationship when I felt so much closer to him and more in love than I do now. We talked more because it was all we had at points. I miss missing him and looking forward to being around him. I'm more worried about the future than excited and it's really worrying me. 

TL;DR: I moved to Australia for a man. Spent a lot on staying here and the relationship is just not going the way I imagined/ dreamed/ expected it would with a lack of communication, affection and quality time spent together. I miss my family in England and I'm feeling so alone. How can I fix this?

"Communication is key. If you can't have a frank conversation about how you're feeling, then you're just prolonging the inevitable.

Scenario 1) You talk, he listens, he talks, you listen. He changes, things improve.

Scenario 2) You talk, he listens, he talks, you listen. He doesn't change, things get worse and you leave knowing that you tried.

Scenario 3) You don't talk, things get worse and you leave, not knowing if you tried enough.

It seems like you're at your wit's end, so talking about it can hardly make it worse, right? Seems like you might need to go back to England for a while anyway, but it would be good to have your relationship either stabilised or over before that happens.

You made a massive change for this man, and from the sound of it, he isn't making much of a change for you. You don't want to be controlling or cause him hassle, but you do deserve to be valued and respected. I'd recommend writing your thoughts down, processing them a little (but not too much) before you talk with him. Maybe have a small list of talking points if there are multiple things you want to address, I find that in the moment I can be quite forgetful.

"This is my first time posting and I came here cos I don’t know where else to go. 

I’m 33(f) and I got married recently (4-5 months back) and we moved in together. It’s been going great, we both love each other’s company, have great intimacy and are really enjoying the honeymoon phase. 

I have a friend who lives in the same city, she was initially planning to move to a different city to save some rent. 
But offlate she’s been implying that she wants to continue staying in the same city and doesn’t want to pay rent. She’s been subtly implying me to offer her to stay at my place. 
I do want to help her out but I kinda feel pushed into this. The other day I did mention that you’re welcome to stay a few days in my place if you like and she immediately said “yes that’s what I need to do” without any hesitation. 
I’m not super great at confronting so I’m not sure how to ask what this means? 
How many days or weeks or months were you thinking? 
She has a boyfriend who visits her every now and then from another state, so is she expecting that her boyfriend will also stay at our place? I don’t think I’m okay with this at all. 

TLDR: I don’t want to be a bad friend but I really don’t know what to do here. I also feel this will impact our ongoing honeymoon phase. Am I being selfish?"	Glum-Introduction506	post	22.07670615818562	female	White	0.9902695417404175	na	na	na	0	relationships

TLDR: Ten years ago, we went on a few dates, but our insecurities got in the way, so we stayed as friends. We discussed the past and our feelings two years ago. We regret it and want to be together, but my divorce isn't finalized yet. Initially, when I told him about the divorce, he suggested no more flirty banter until I'm divorced. Then, he brought up sexual topics for the first time. After I rebuffed this, he apologized and said again that we should not flirt anymore because if we do, he won't be able not to escalate our conversation. Since then, our conversation has been less, low effort, and uninteresting. Should this worry me? 

We met through a mutual friend over a decade ago. We spent time with our friends, then started going on dates.  After a few dates, I asked what was going on between us. He said he was figuring that out. I took that as disinterest and started dating other men, then entered a relationship with someone else.

 

A year later, I was single and told him about the breakup. He asked me on a date. We went on dates for a few months before he started half responding to my texts and not returning my calls. He began trying to make last-minute plans, so I told him I was too busy and needed more notice. I also found a new boyfriend and moved 2 hours away before becoming single again. 

 

After moving five years ago, I told him I admired him. He told me he was not yet the man he wanted to be. I started dating my now-husband, and my friend visited me occasionally.

 

I announced my engagement four years and things changed between us. He started contacting me more. He told me he finally landed the job he'd always wanted and would build a home soon. He started referencing our previous dates, which we hadn't discussed in years. When I asked for clarification, he would say, ""We shouldn't discuss it since it was from one of our dates."" I was happy with my fiancé despite some struggles we had overcome, so I ignored my friend's hints and thanked him for respecting my relationship.

 

After I married my husband, my friend still occasionally referenced our past. After two years, I confronted him. He revealed that he had always deeply cared for me, but pushed me away because he worried, I wouldn't like him anymore if I knew him more because he had dropped out of college and still lived with his parents while I had my own apartment, was finishing grad school, and had started my career. He said he believed I deserved better than him.

 

I told him I never viewed him or his circumstances that way. Instead, I saw he was working toward the career he wanted, which didn't require a college degree. I saw other things in his character and how he courted me on our dates that I valued. After the discussion, we felt like fools and regretted not communicating our concerns previously. We grew closer and he noticed the shortcomings within my marriage, although I tried to hide them. He kept asking if I was happy, if my spouse helped me, and participated in various aspects of my life. I deflected these questions with praise for my husband and talk of gratitude.

 

Some months ago, he visited, and we went to lunch, but this time it felt like those old dates. He insisted on paying for my meal, opened doors for me, hugged me goodbye for a long time and kissed the top of my head. He asked if I still had romantic feelings for him. I told him I do, but that I didn't plan to leave my marriage and didn’t want to give him false hopes. He said he knows I would never lead him on. I told him he should find another woman to make him happy. He shared that over the years had had only briefly dated one other woman. He said he has little interest in dating around and hopes we’ll end up together.

 

Later, he told me he wants me completely, and he knows it's selfish, but he wishes things could change so we can be together. I told him the situation is what it is, blowing him off because hearing him directly undermine my marriage made me angry.

 

After this, something suddenly impacted me financially, and my spouse refused to help me. This has happened before. So, I requested help from my family, and I decided on a divorce.

 

Recently, I shared this news with my friend. He immediately wanted to know if I wanted to be with him. I said I would once I am divorced. Then, he called and asked many questions, laying out a whole game plan for the transition together. He reassured me that the last thing he would ever want to do was hurt me. Then, he said he would not continue flirting with me while I'm still married, but that we could continue talking as friends. 

 

However, he started bringing up sexual topics for the first time. I suggested we not talk about it. He apologized and agreed, but after backsliding into some flirty exchanges, it happened again, so he said no more flirting until I’m divorced, so he can do what is right for our situation. He said he knows he will escalate the conversation if we flirt. 

Now, we talk only once a week, but we used to talk almost daily. The conversation is dry and low-effort. After a month, I worried he had moved on. Then, he asked for updates on the divorce process and how I'm doing. I don't know how to take our current situation. Why is my friend acting the way he currently is? Should his newfound inability to not escalate flirty chats into sexual conversation be a concern since I want more than sex from him?"

I (23,F) stay with my boyfriend (25,M). All is well between us. We both have our flaws and have accepted each other fully (over the 4 yrs of our relationship). He loves me, takes care of me, he doesn't want me to tire myself when he takes 1 hour walks to and from work every day, taking night-shifts just to make sure there is food on the table. He always wants to satisfy my cravings even though he doesn't make enough money for both of us. We hardly make ends meet. My parents want to sponsor me to go back to university school in order to make up for the missing credits which I need for graduation. My parents are not that well off either, they just try their best to help me build a good future for myself. Now I know that after they sponsor me for school all my expenses are going to increase as I am going to need money for transport and lunch at school. Currently I just stay home playing games all day and night. My boyfriend even does more cooking and cleaning in the house while I do small tasks.  I have no income, I am 100% dependent on him and my family.

If I continue this way things are never going to go well for me in the future. I have attempted working before but at first my boyfriend rejected the idea saying he will do his best to make things right and that I should not stress myself [nothing changed]. I then pushed the matter a few month's  later (Nov 2022) and he agreed with the condition that I do not do any mini jobs like being a waiter, a guard or anything of that sort saying the jobs are way beneath me. I applied to those jobs which he agreed to but those jobs required experience and specific qualifications.  None of them called to this day. So this means I still did not work even after our agreement on 2022. I want to bring up this issue again but I know there's going to be another cycle of arguments and him sulking (he always sulks even with the smallest of things like me not agreeing that X owns a car). This time though things are going to be worse because I want to apply for night-shifts which he is TOTALLY against. The way my dad is adamant about me going to school I know there are high chances that they will sponsor me for school this coming month of September. So I want to attempt going to school during the day and take night-shifts to cover the expenses. 

My boyfriend is going to be totally against me being a waiter and even worse that it is a night shift. He always says we will manage but there are those times in which I have to use toilet paper as sanitary pads as we could not afford them. I am  and have always been lazy. I want to change but I do not know how to convince my boyfriend. I don't want him to sulk as it hurts me.

How do I convince him? He says night-shifts are not safe for me. Please don't be hard on me

"Hey! First off, I'm sorry that your boyfriend is not being helpful as you work to improve your life and your situation. I want to start by saying that you are awesome for wanting to go back to school, work, and improve both your situation and your work ethic.

There are partners who don't want their partners to work out of a controlling place (they want their partner to depend on them so they don't leave them). But it sounds like your boyfriend is a really caring and loving person, so I will assume that his resistance to you working comes from a good place.

My guess is that he feels that if you need to work, especially something he feels is risky or ""beneath you"" like a night shift at a restaurant, then he has failed to provide for you. This may make him feel like a bad partner, or ""less of a man"" if he is someone raised with traditional gender roles. He is probably already insecure about things since you are both struggling to make ends meet.

When you talk to him about it next, make it clear that you are doing this for you, and the growth that you want to achieve. Not because he failed you (because it sounds like you really appreciate him!) If he says he is uncomfortable with it, tell him that you have made your choice, and that if he wants to protect you and take care of you, that includes taking care of your dreams and goals and supporting you as you make a change. 

You don't have to compromise, but maybe some of the jobs that he originally felt were ""beneath you"" do have openings during the day. Or maybe he can drop you off and pick you up at your night shift job.

I encourage you to help your boyfriend open his mind to different roles in the relationship, even if it's tense. It will help both of you live your best lives!

"TL;DR I’m stalking my ex’s ex-girlfriend and I need some advice on how to stop

My (33/F) ex (33/M) cheated on me with this girl he worked with and ever since then I have been obsessed with her. Instagram, Facebook, Googling her, anything I can find. I had created fake IG and FB accounts to follow her friends and family in case they posted as well. In the beginning it did have a lot to do with my ex because he dated her after we split. It was a horrible breakup and I wanted to figure out why she was so special to my ex. Anyway a few years later they broke up, she moved on and met her now-husband immediately after and they have a house and now a baby on the way, perfect life for her.

Now I am just obsessed with her. I always want to see new information and pictures of what she has been up to. I also envy she was able to move on from my ex and I have been so damaged by his abuse that I am still stuck all alone (I have not spoken to him in 3 years though, that relationship is completely over, so yay me?). I recognize all of this is unhealthy and I am terribly insecure and have low self-esteem.

I would be in therapy right now but I have no health insurance and cannot afford it. So I want to try what I can on my own first.

So I am finally posting here because I was doing ok for the past couple of weeks but then I ""relapsed"" again tonight and just went on a binge. I just feel ashamed of myself right now.

I would love to hear your suggestions on this, thank you!"	advertising809	post	45.13541947891401	female	White	0.9965364933013916	na	na	na	4	relationships
Lol my abusers tried to make me jealous by manipulating dating algorithms and other techniques to match me and introduce me to people that looked like them.

It's tying you down to a past you don't want any part of, and I'm sorry that he hurt you so much that you've been a little obsessed with this person.

It seems to have become something like an addiction, and judging by your use of the word relapse I think you can see that, too.

So I guess the play is similar to other forms of addiction. Put obstacles in your way, unfriend, unfollow, block, anything that makes it harder for you to slip into the old habit.

"How do you stop?

By understanding there was nothing special about the girl who he cheated you with. The only thing she offered him was that she was easy available person to cheat with, who had no morals. There is nothing else of her that's different or that she would be special. It's more common for people to ""cheat down"" for this same reason, lower quality people are easier, more available and have no morals or values.

"So, I'm extremely sensitive to being interrupted while speaking. I understand that interruptions happen in everyday conversation, so I try and be patient about it when they do, and I explain to my friends it really upsets me when I'm saying something and someone else talks over me. Most people around me understand, and do their best to respect this particular sensitivity, much like I do my best not to get too bothered when someone slips up about it.  
  
My mother is the exception. She interrupts me, talks over me, even finishes my sentences for me literally \*all the time\* that we're together. Moreover, she does this only to me - the only person in the family who is going to get really angry over it. I'm pretty sure she's not trying to abuse me - I think it's rather some psychological thing, like subconsciously flipping exactly the switches that will anger me as a call for attention, I don't know. She absolutely adores me and when she speaks with me she seems to get over-excited, like a child who really wants to blurt their words out and can't wait for the other person to finish.  
  
I tried talking to her about it, and calling her out when she does it, and she gets really mortified and apologises profusely. But it doesn't serve to change her behaviour. Within 24 hours she's back to talking over me, like she doesn't even realize she's doing it. In recent times I've really lost my patience with this and several of our evenings together have been spoiled.  
  
It's really deteriorating my relationship with her, which is a shame, because I love her and would enjoy her company otherwise. But more and more I'm beginning to feel like I don't want to go back home at all, because I don't want to put myself through this.  
  
Talking to her doesn't work, and if at all possible I'd really like to avoid having to take measures that will wound her (yelling, getting furious and making a scene). Is there anything I can do to make her correct this bad habit?

tl;dr: My mother has a habit of interrupting me all the time in conversation, which she knows I am especially susceptible to, and I don't know how to get her to stop."	Judge_T	post	21.078964873687177	female	White	0.9994949102401733	na	na	na	8	relationships
"Just. Keep. Talking.

Normal voice, at a normal rhythm and volume, as if she isn't speaking at all. If you're not finished, just *don't yield*.

However, also realize your mother is getting older and there *may* be new limits to her ability to control impulses, process language, or hear... All sorts of things could be contributing to a *genuine limitation.* Encountering these for the first time with our parents is really upsetting, and she's young enough it might not be the case, but nevertheless, I think you need to allow for the possibility that she is coming up against new limits that weren't there a decade ago. 

And realize you've become hyper-sensitive to her doing this, as opposed to anyone else. You're naturally going to react more strongly, if you're always anticipating and watching for this boundary-bust. Some greater calm would serve you well, even if it doesn't stop her.

I agree with this method.

I suggest that at the same moment she interrupts and you continue speaking, you also gently hold your hand up, palm out, in the Stop position.

You could also try this.  When she interrupts, immediately stop talking and let her speak until she has completed her thought. Keep your body language and facial expression calm and neutral.  Say nothing.  Nothing AT ALL.

You are training her to realize that when she interrupts or finishes your sentence, there is an immediate consequence.  She wanted you to stop talking, so you have stopped talking.  

Wait.  Wait quietly and patiently.  She needs to experience discomfort, discomfort she will want to avoid in the future.

She needs to say she is sorry, and ask you to finish what you were saying.  If she laughs or tries to make a joke, continue your silence, looking at her neutrally.

"Apologies in advance if any of this is incoherent, I'm struggling to put it all down in words right now. I know that my girlfriends (30) and I (28) love each other, but it feels to me that we're in a cycle of abuse/hurt that isn't close to getting any better.  
  
I'll try to keep our backgrounds concise, and say that she was abused by her parents physically, verbally, and emotionally up until her early twenties. She was in therapy for years, but a few months after us dating her therapist left her practice. I grew up around in places where domestic abuse was prevalent, and my mom and I got out of that situation by the time I was in my early teens. We've both had struggles with mental illness, but are in general well-adjusted, functioning adults.  
  
We've now been dating for a year and a half, with her moving in 2 months ago, and our relationship has never been worse. She was priced out of her previous apartment and had big feelings about the forced move. I empathized as best I could, and showed up daily the week that she had to move so I could assist with the moving process. During the move, I felt like I was the object of her resentment and that nothing I could say or do was enough for her. In later conversations, she admitted that my feeling was true, that she had displaced her negative feelings onto me, but maintains that it's ultimately my fault that she was upset because I got angry/upset/disappointed with her for being sad.  


  
I'd say this is the largest part of the cycle that we're in: I take issue with a piece of her behavior (saying mean things about me, a lack on her end of the kind language she expects from me, not giving us space to process our feelings, etc.) which she then tells me is my being upset with her for having feelings. I do my best to validate that she feels like I'm upset with her, and then express that it's her behavior that I want to talk about. In the midst of these conversations, she will bring something up (my tone, my face, words I chose, a previous conflict) and get very emotional, start to cry or hyperventilate, and we'll continue this back and forth until I give in and say it's all my fault or she tells me that I'm being abusive by not listening to all the things that she has to say.  


  
Things came to a head last month after a string of fights. I pleaded that we take some time apart, and provided 4 different options of one or both of us staying somewhere else to provide an opportunity for self-care away from each other. She refused all of them, telling me that I was effectively making her homeless by telling her where to go. In that week, she would tell me that she would only talk to me if we went down to her car, and then proceed to tell me that if I wanted to fix our relationship I had to listen to everything she said without talking back. I would be told by her how abusive I am, about my patterns of abusing her, and how I cause her to be traumatized and triggered by my treatment of her. I would cry heavily inside of these conversations without speaking up, and then be told that my crying and not wanting to be touched by her is a tactic of manipulation on my end to make her comfort me after I abused her.  
  
At the end of that week she stormed out of our place after telling me that I make her feel constantly unsafe. When she left I thought that that was the end of our relationship. A few hours later she started calling my phone and texting me non-stop, begging for me to take her back and not make her homeless. I assured her that she had friends that could support her, and that if we gave it time we could talk about our relationship, but right now we needed space. I bought her a hotel for a week, and in that time she wrote me a touching letter, walked back her claims of abuse, committed to getting herself back in therapy and opening up to her friends about her struggles. I was really moved by the letter, about how affectionate and kind it was, something that I had been asking for for months, and took her back.  
  
It's been a month since then, and none of the above happened. She made an attempt to get back into therapy, but navigating America's atrocious healthcare system makes her too anxious. She relies on me financially, which I know is a cause of anxiety, and is waiting for a contract to renew before attempting to move back in with her former roommate. I can count on one hand the kindnesses that she's tried to pay me, while I'm still being expected to cater to and sooth her daily.  
  
This week, she's read through Lundy's ""Why Does He Do That,"" and has picked back up her claims of being abused. She's been showing me screenshots, and making pleas that I acknowledge how much I abuse her. I've read the book too now, and see her sulking, refusals to eat, lack of commitment to promises made, reversals of cause and effect, and tendency to not let a conflict resolve until I admit to being the only one to blame as signs of abuse. She tells me that because I interrupt her when we're in conflict and speak with authority, saying things like ""this is how things are,"" that I'm being controlling and abusive. Last night, she told me too that she didn't mean what she wrote in the letter because she hadn't eaten in days and was homeless. I've asked gently for over a month for her to reread some portion of it, which is something that the first paragraph of the letter says she would do.  
  
My friends, family, and myself have all said that it's clear that the relationship is not working out. I don't have it in me to break things off when she tells me that I'm making her homeless, and now I've been told I'm abusive so much that I believe. I feel like I can't keep my head on straight anymore, and my friends have told me that I don't seem like myself anymore because of all my misgivings.  


Does anyone know what I should do to figure out if I'm as abusive as she says I am?  
  
TL;DR  
  
Relationship has been bad since June, and my girlfriend has gone back and forth on whether I'm abusing her. I don't know if she's right, and think she may be manipulating me to have control in a chapter of life that has afforded her very little. Really just need insight, thoughts, questions to figure out what the hell is going on in my relationship.

"I'll copy my comment from your deleted post:

""I don't consider myself abusive, but if you do, then we're done. Clearly dating an abusive person isn't healthy, and since you don't seem to be willing to do what's best for yourself, I'll do what's best for both of us and end the relationship. You have 30 days to move before I evict you.""

The eviction part is based on whether she has tenancy (likely, if she's been living there for more than a year).

But yeah, what are you doing trying to stay with her? If you're abusive (and I have major doubts, but let's be overly trusting of her intentions), then you can't be in a relationship with her and certainly can't be living with her. So end the relationship and tell her to go get her own place ASAP.

Most likely she's manipulating you, but frankly you should take NO chances if she's throwing around claims you're abusing her. Take her at her word and get her out of your life before she starts collecting evidence for the police.

People flee abusive partners without having housing lined up *all the time.* It's why women's shelters exist.

" My SO has a history of lying about things we have clearly discussed when on trips with his friends. It’s happened on every trip he’s been on with his friends in the last 13 years which is really about 5-10 trips. I once caught him in a BIGGG lie via Life360. 

We’re trying to work through this stuff but when I asked him if he would be open to downloading Life360, he said absolutely not. I was confused at the strong stance considering we both have find friends on our phones (originally downloaded when we were long distance).

When I asked him why find friends was okay but Life360 isn’t he said, “Find friends is native to the iPhone where as Life360 feels like it’s for a ducking 10 year old. Life360 is an invasion of privacy.”

I told him I felt more comfortable with Life360 because it’s actually accurate but he refuses and I’m obviously not going to force him.

What would you do in this situation? I’m unsure what to think.

i have been talking to this guy for a few weeks. he 13M, and i am 13F. yes, we are young and i am aware. he  is really sweet, funny, and understanding. he always wants to facetime me. he also goes through the trouble of talking to me whenever i can because i am currently grounded. on the first day of school (a few days) he wants to match shoes and outfit. he also wants to go on a movie date or something like that. he’s pretty considerate and decent. i like him, but, there are lots of things i am constantly worrying about.
-he talks to so. many. girls. he’s a total ladies man. he says they are all just his friends but this still bothers me a lot. 
-he still talks to this girl who i will call addy, 13F, who is creepily, crazily and disgustingly fking obsessed with him. he will not remove her from his life whenver she comes back because he says its “funny”. he also repeatedly calls me addy on ft instead of my name. (my name also starts with an a, but still???)
-in the last relationship he had, they fked. (she is also 13F) we are fairly young, so this is major ick for me. apparently, at his school, it’s a big drama ridden thing, and somehow his ex/that situation always comes creeping back into our conversations on his behalf.
-he gets mad at me for the stupidest things. he always gets mad when i get jealous but then i can’t be mad when he gets jealous. 
-he has a big attitude. and it’s not a very positive one either.
-he’s not really someone who you can vent to or write paragraphs too, because you ain’t getting s**t back. 

i really like this boy, but he’s such a handful. at the same time i get why he is like this, because his mom is extremely rude to him and mentally abuses him and favorites his little brother. he is also hated by a lot of the school and people do not like him very much. the other night he was crying on ft after i told him some girl added me telling him she said he was a b***h and unloyal and a cheater, etc. i rlly want to make this work between me and him. how do i communicate with him better? what should i do?

"Is he a red flag? Yeah. Sounds like it.

  
You wrote \~4 sentences that you find are positive things about him (or rather, why you like him), and then a paragraph and a half that are negative.  
\- he's a handful  
\- he brings up his ex  
\- gets jealous but doesn't like it when you are  
\- a negative big attitude  
\- calls you by a different girls name (huh? have you asked him to stop?)  
\- something he's done is a major ick for you (do you feel he expects do want to do it with you?)  
I wonder if the list is even longer than this in reality.

Let him know that him calling you by the wrong name hurts, and see how he responds. I think that may be quite telling whether he's actually listening to you and respectful of your feelings.

If he responds with something like ""It's just a joke"", ""Not that big of a deal"", etc. it would indicate he doesn't understand the impact his words or actions have. Or doesn't care.

You like him and he might like you, but is he good for you? Not just good \*to\* you. Relationships should be like an equation, but where the sum is larger than the parts combined together (if that makes sense). Do you think you'd be happier with him in the end, or would the negative sides about him exhaust you?

Your feelings may take over and you want to give it a try with him anyway and that's okay! Just be careful :)

It's not wrong of you to want him to cut ""Addy"" out of his life, if he were to be your boyfriend- you should also ask why he keeps calling you her name- is it a thought association thing and he slips up? Regardless, yeah, it's an issue.

TBH, if he keeps interacting with you and making you his ""go to"" girl, and you are into him.. chances are, the relationship will develop anyway. I would just try to communicate, not through text, the boundaries you have and the red flags you've come across. Don't expect maturity from him, though, he's only 13.

Anyways, guys don't like naggy girls especially in the ""talking"" phase, so it's best you probably just chill and take the relationship for what it is and go with the flow."	rand0mstranger_	reply	na	na	na	0.006334117613732815	weak	no	no	na	relationships
thank you for giving me something to think about. yes, i have asked him to stop and have hung up the phone multiple times whenver he does it. ig usually ends with him being like “fine, be mad then”.  i have not gotten a chance to communicate with him because his dumb**s got grounded for sneaking out. tomorrow, i’ll see him at school. and i am very, very nervous. i feel like i want to give him a try but i fear it’ll get tiring  very quickly.	rand0mstranger_	follow-up	na	na	na	0.006334117613732815	weak	strong	no	na	relationships

"Should I be forcing myself to stay up late, or should my partner plan to have things to keep him occupied at night? Or just any general advice would be great.

Background info: My boyfriend 37m and I (37f) live about 90 miles away from each other and we trade off between me driving to his place and him coming to mine. We are in our late thirties, I am divorced and have three kids who I have primary custody of (youngest just turned 4). I'm in grad school and work and he has a FT job. Sometimes when he comes over all my kids are there, sometimes I have just my oldest there, and sometimes I go to his place on my own. On this particular weekend it was just my almost-13 year old.  
We have been romantic for about 10 months but have known each other (and even used to be roommates) for almost 20 years.  
He typically stays up super late (he has insomnia and also prefers to stay up), and I typically go to bed around 10 or 11 but on weekends I do my best to try to stay up later. There have been several nights where I've stayed up with him until 4 or 5 but it taxes me and I have a hard time sleeping in. Also if I don't get 7 hours it really messes with my mental health and wellbeing. Being a divorced/single mom is incredibly difficult and my four year old still wakes up some nights several times a night. Needless to say, I'm tired a lot.  
Friday when he came over, I did my best to stay up and fell asleep around 11. He told me that he ended up falling alseep on the couch because I was sprawled out on my bed with no room for him and that I had stolen the covers. I asked why he didn't wake me up, but out of politeness he didn't want to wake me. He couldn't find a blanket so he slept on the couch after doing nothing all night by himself. I felt terrible and reassured him that next time he can wake me up or take the covers anyways because I want him to be comfortable.  
Saturday night we spent the whole day together at 9:30 I could feel my eyelids getting heavy. I warned him and said I'm so sorry, I don't want to be tired but I can feel it coming on. I asked him what he was planning to do if I fell asleep because I felt bad that I was getting so tired so early. I reminded him that he didn't have to be quiet, and that if anything I WANT to be awake so make all the noise he wants. My 13 year old was awake and stays up until midnight on summer weekends. I asked him twice and he didn't really give me an answer and he finally said to not worry, that he wanted me to get rest. I said well maybe I'll just sleep for an hour and then have a second wind.  
At 11 I wake up to him sitting on the edge of my bed in the dark and I said hey what are you doing? And he said he was thinking about leaving. I was surprised and I said what!? why!? And he said ""Because I'm literally just sitting in your dark room doing nothing"". And I said I'm sorry but you can watch TV or make yourself at home, like what do you want to be doing? And he said playing music but all his music stuff is two hours away. He said ""What sounds more fun for me? Being at home with my music and cable TV and being able to take bong hits or sitting alone in a dark room?"" and I said well obviously the first. He pointed out that on Thursday before he was there, I stayed up watching TV and drinking wine until 11:30 and he felt offended that I was able to stay up later on a Thursday without him than with him being there. He said ""I want to be having fun and on Saturdays I'm usually just getting my night started at 11:30. If I drive all this way I want you to be conscious.""  
Anyways I said OK well I will stay up. I had some anxiety that if I drifted off he would just leave, especially because we both have separate plans the following weekend so we won't see each other for two weeks. I stayed up until 3 (aided by caffeine and anxiety) and woke up at 7 because I can't sleep in. I feel that it wasn't kind to put me in that position and he completely disagrees. When I told him I felt hurt that he had threatened to just suddenly leave after me falling asleep, he said he thought I was being controlling for not letting him. (Although I wasn't trying to stop him if he actually wanted to, and I ended up staying up anyways)  
Ideally I want to be able to stay up but sometimes I just get super tired and I value sleep a lot. He says he thinks the fact that I stayed up Thursday effected me Saturday and I disagree. When I'm at home without him there I fall asleep even at 9 or 9:30 often. But I truly do make an effort to stay up when I'm with him - we've gone to many late-night concerts and other situations where I've stayed up very late to accommodate his schedule. But my life is not fitting for long, late nights and I need sleep to do all of the things that are required of me to parent solo.  
tl;dr my boyfriend thinks I should stay up much later when he's there and I think he should understand if once in a while I'm too tired to stay up late.

"Sorry, did you say he is 17 or 37?

It’s hard to tell.


On a more serious note, a partner who doesn’t value or support the health of your ‘mental health’ is going to wear you down and wear you down and wear you down, until you are questioning your sanity. Been there. Watched a friend do it too. 6 months after she left him, she looks 10years younger. It’s amazing what sleep does for you ;)

Edit: basically both men wanted a buddy, a mummy and a lover rolled into one. Something where all their needs where met while we were worn down and depleted.

My husband and I are the reverse. He's the early morning person and I'm the night owl. However we don't expect or make each other change, which is what your boyfriend is trying to do. Husband gets up early and does whatever. He goes to bed early and I do whatever. Which is actually great as we get our own alone time. Again it's not the sleeping difference causing an issue here it's him trying to control when you sleep. It's not like he doesn't have a phone or couldn't bring a laptop or a book or whatever he likes to do. He could put together legos or a jigsaw puzzle if that's what he's into.

"I've been having a really tough day, I'm really tempted to break up with my boyfriend, but at the same time, I love him and the thought of a breakup really saddens me. We have a great relationship, we've been together for a year and we're each other's best friend and partner. This may sound like a really stupid reason to end a relationship, but please try to understand.

When I was a child and a teenager, my parents taught me that showing weakness and vulnerability is wrong, my father taught me I had to be someone people could look up to and/or rely on, no weakness allowed. I know this is unhealthy, I'm not a robot and I'm allowed to be weak at times, but this is what I was taught as a child and getting rid of that mentality is really difficult. Additionally, my mother and my father died when I was a teenager. After their death, I basically became my younger brother's mummy, I had to protect him, look after him, reassure him... this reinforced my father's ''teachings'' even more.

My boyfriend really likes this characteristic of mine, because I tend to be like this as a romantic partner too. I don't expect my man to be my emotional punching bag or my provider, not at all, I'd be uncomfortable with that because of my upbringing, I tend to help a lot, I support emotionally, financially.. I don't want him to pay for my stuff, I actually tend to want to pay for our stuff, because that's what I was taught and what I eventually had to do after my parents died when I had to be my brother's mum, it just is instilled in my brain at this point and this is what I believe makes me valuable, being like this is all I've ever known.

Long story short: my boyfriend has always literally worshipped me because he thinks I'm really attractive, sometimes he goes as far as saying ''if Taylor Swift ( my favourite singer and my idol, that's why he mentions her) is a 10 out of 10, you're a 15'' or ''you're as beautiful as Megan Fox, except Megan Fox is plastic while you're natural''. I'm not trying to brag, he literally says those things all the time and he enthusiastically compliments my looks every day multiple times. Two nights ago I crumbled and became insecure for no reason... I literally acted batsh\*t crazy for an hour or so and I called myself ugly in front of him. Obviously, he tried to support me, he said ''omg what are you saying no, you're so beautiful!''. But after this event, I've become extremely uncomfortable in our relationship, I feel like I'm not valuable anymore as a person and as a partner because I was weak for an hour. I told you the story of my life before, what I was taught and what I went through and I think you understand why I'm totally uncomfortable in our relationship now. I genuinely love my boyfriend a lot, but I'm so uncomfortable in our relationship right now that I have genuinely lost interest altogether and I want to break up.

In an attempt to fix things, at least in my own mind, after lunch I told him about a man who hit on me this morning (it really happened), I almost made him jealous, I wasn't trying to brag about being able to attract men, I was trying to show him that I'm aware of my good looks, which means I'm confident, strong and therefore valuable.

I know this is fcked up and stupid, but I had a very particular upbringing which I explained before, and additionally, I had life experiences that reinforced that upbringing. I'm trying to get over what happened two nights ago, but I can't. What am I supposed to do? We have a really perfect relationship, we're each other's best friend and romantic partner, I don't want to end it.

Tl;dr I'm uncomfortable around my boyfriend and I may want to end the relationship for this reason, I exposed my vulnerability two days ago and I'm not fine with that."	throwaway8810_	post	14.410784493210118	female	White	0.003596496069803834	na	na	na	5	relationships
">When I was a child and a teenager, my parents taught me that showing weakness and vulnerability is wrong, my father taught me I had to be someone people could look up to and/or rely on, no weakness allowed.

The problem with this upbringing is that you are not allowed to be an honest person, not with yourself or with anyone else. Because your parents died before you could go fully outgrow your parent-pleasing identity and embrace your adult self, you probably got stuck back there. Most of us have to go through a period of rejecting our parents' visions for us, but you never really had the chance. Plus, caring for your brother reinforced their teachings.

At some point, if you want to outgrow the kind of reaction you describe in your post, you will have to go through rebelling against their stuff. It's normal, it's natural, and you missed it. A therapist could really help with this, and it might not take long.

"Real talk: How exactly does being so emotionally constipated that you can't cry in front of your boyfriend without feeling the urge to abandon your relationship translate into ""strength""?

Speaking as someone who was taught similar values growing up, I can tell you that it doesn't. What you're describing is not strength, it's denial, and I guarantee that if you keep it up all of those emotions you keep walling off will come out sideways sooner or later. Plus, even if you were to dump your boyfriend and start over fresh with someone new, he's going to see you cry, too, eventually, assuming you stay together long enough.

It is admirable that you feel the way you do about being strong. Showing 'weakness' is not a sign of being weak. How you handle your weakness and let it affect you, determines how strong you are. You are doing your best to be his rock all the time. Shouldn't it be ok for him to be yours, when you're worn down, exhausted, and burned out? If you are looking at him to be your husband in the future, wouldn't you want some you can trust to cover your shortcomings and reassure you like you try to do for them? You want to throw him out for wanting to protect his strong queen?	throwaway8810_	reply	na	na	na	0.003596496069803834	weak	no	no	na	relationships
"You showed a moment of vulnerability and humanity to your boyfriend, and your solution is to push him away and run away? That’s the real weakness, not crying in front of him.

You’ve rightly identified that what you were taught about weakness as a child is wrong, yet you continue to let it guide your actions. Either you break the cycle or you allow it to change. 

It sounds like a childhood issue you need to process in therapy of some sort, but don’t break up with your boyfriend until you seek the help you need, otherwise you will probably continue to play out this cycle over and over again."	throwaway8810_	reply	na	na	na	0.003596496069803834	no	no	no	na	relationships

I would stow away in the bottom of a shrimp boat on the Bering Sea without a life jacket if I had to.  Now I am saying all this because I have found myself in a sexless, please believe me when I say that I mean if it were not for my hand and a very good battery operated friend, I would have to be sent to the old time doctor and be treated for hysteria. It is way too much of a risk in this age group.  If you were in your twenties I would say no problem horny men that age are a dime a dozen.  Matter of fact if you dont end up staying with him, maybe you could hook me up.	scorpioinheels	reply	na	na	na	0.0017761107301339507	no	strong	no	na	relationships

"I’m gonna come in way on the opposite side of the field from most people.

I have been there before with my then boyfriend leaving for the Air Force. We had been on and off through high school and we got back together after he enlisted but before he left. Not just the sex but everything about being with him was awesome.. favorite person in the whole world. And I did not want a long distance relationship. At the time I didn’t want to get married or have kids, ever.

But I stayed. I don’t even really know why aside from that it was the best relationship we’d ever had and we were both incredibly happy aside from the Air Force. I wasn’t even seeing him once a month. We would go months on end without being in the same room. But we Skyped, we texted and called and sent letters and presents. When he was “home” he still had 6 years of leaving for a few weeks at a time. I’m not going to lie to you, it was really hard. It took a ton of perseverance. But I couldn’t walk away from him because he is the love of my life. And I wasn’t loving the situation but I love him.

Now it’s been 10 years married and 5 years since he was discharged. We are still very much in love. The long distance is probably our easiest adversity we’ve faced in our relationship. The infertility (and the pandemic) were the worst. Now I’m lying here scrolling with my 6 month old sleeping on me and my husband sleeping next to me snoring. We have our own business and work great together as parents, lovers and even professionally.

So if it helps. If you want to give it a shot. I say go for it. You don’t always get what you *want* and sometimes it can be a good thing.

But none of it will work without some serious open, meaningful and serious conversation. Everyone needs to be on the same page."	scorpioinheels	reply	na	na	na	0.0017761107301339507	no	strong	no	na	relationships

TL;DR: How much frustration/annoyance is tolerable in a LTR?

We’ve been dating off and on for over a year and a half. He wants to be with me forever. He paid part of my flight for me to come with him to a very cool city abroad (I had done him a big favor before so it’s not totally undeserved!). 

I love the city. But I am struggling with him. We aren’t connecting that well. He and I seem to have very different tastes and ways of being. I don’t like sharing a hotel with him. I don’t like having him around me 24/7. I find him annoying as he’s so awkward and bad at fitting into this slightly different/new culture and I am finding it really easy for myself. 

But then he does sweet stuff like buys me a gift at the gift shop, pops out to get late night snacks, is agreeable about everything I want to do. He’s easygoing and ultra kind, but also a little (ok, a lot) oblivious and unaware and it drives me up the actual wall. Plus sometimes I think he’s too young/inexperienced for me and I thirst for someone more sophisticated and aware. I’ve had that before and it’s been great, but unfortunately often the guy is also taking me for granted or not able to commit fully. This current guy is fully in, but now I find I am not sure I am. It’s so frustrating. 

I am in a stage of life where I don’t want to break up and start over to find my person because I don’t have oodles of time to do that….

 but is it supposed to feel this frustrating and annoying at every turn with someone you’re supposed to spend the rest of your life with?"	designsun	post	18.84974921708884	female	White	0.9990930557250977	na	na	na	1	relationships

"TL;DR Seeking advice on whether breaking up is a good idea, just scared of the consequences


So I (M22) have been dating my gf (F19) for about 20 months now, but over the past couple months or so I just haven't been feeling the same as I did with my ex, with my ex it was always fun and new, like a full time honeymoon period. But with my gf it feels too....normal?


I still think she's gorgeous and I still think she's an amazing person, we met a long time ago (about 6 years or so) but have only really talked to one another for the past 2 years. She helped me pick up the pieces after my ex broke me and things grew from there. 


I guess I do find her a little annoying at times but aren't we all? I'm scared of a couple things, I'm scared of being alone, I'm scared of our joint friends leaving (tbh I wouldn't want them to cut contact with either of us as she doesn't have many friends and I wouldn't want her to be alone) and I'm scared of regretting it. I still think she's amazing and funny and gorgeous and I don't want to break up and just regret it for years, she's not really done anything wrong I'm just not sure if it's just me being irrational or if I'm losing interest idk


I'm starting to ramble now so I'll leave it there and answer any questions anyone has

"I (34/F) am in a relatively new LDR with a guy (27/M) that I met gaming online. We chatted for 8 months casually and progressively flirtatiously and have been exclusively dating for the past two.

It’s his first relationship, ever. The age gap is something I was worried about, but his lack of emotional intelligence and sometimes even his lack of empathy and patience — is proving to be the bigger issue. We argue frequently and both started our own individual therapy to address our attachment styles (I’m anxious, he’s avoidant) and the way we communicate with each other, among other things.

I recently caught him talking about me behind my back with his group of online friends (saying that every time he tries to break up with me, it makes me a better person) and that was incredibly hurtful and a deep betrayal. He laughed with his friends about it, who have never met me and don’t like me. He gets upset with me that I want to be prioritized over gaming, he frequently gets irritated with me when I want to talk through our relationship issues, and he’s really defensive when I bring up that online group of friends and say he should cut back his time with them. And then he always comes back saying he wants to change and be better, take steps, make strides to improve all of these things and then makes the same decisions over and over, demonstrating that he either has no intention or self-discipline to actually change. 

Example: He’ll decline my phone call if he’s in a video game session. 

I’m at the end of my rope, I used to think this relationship was something special and worth saving because we talked about a future together, we’ve made all these trips back and forth to see each other and we’re very happy when we’re together. But on the flip side, lately it seems like no amount of happiness, great sex, or shared memories is enough for him to stop obsessively focusing and dooms-daying over every argument we have; he lingers on them for an undetermined amount of time, always telling me that he’s unhappy, just overlooking all of the really nice things we’ve shared, done, and learned about each other along the way. 

I know I need to end it; I turn 35 at the end of this month and just have this sinking feeling that I am going to end up alone. I thought that being patient and reassuring and a place of support for him would make him understand, but it’s just feeling like a futile effort now. We never had a honeymoon phase, he called me clingy. He’s said and described things about me that no one has ever said to me before, and I think it’s just because he never actually knew me, nor does he care to.

Just looking for some encouraging words, experiences, or other sentiments, I guess, because it’s hard for me to comfort myself right now.

"TL;DR: My wife suggested to me tonight that maybe she should go to school full time while I work full time, which is ok and all, except that  she wants to go to film school. Which is my lifelong dream

I genuinely need help. I'm concerned that my wife not only isn't someone who wants what's best for me...sometimes I think she wants what's worst for me. Now this is a woman I've been married to for 6 years. And my heart tells me that if she is still convincing me from time to time that she actually enjoys punishing me, starting fights for no reason, messing with me, making me feel small, unimportant, irrelevant -- no matter how mad she is at me -- well, maybe that should tell me enough? Anyways, here's what happened tonight...

Preface for context:

My dream since I was 7 has been to go to film school and be a filmmaker. It's what I wanted more than anything in the world. I made endless short films with my brother growing up, I watched behind the scenes of every movie, I watched every movie...this was my DREAM. I also have always loved editing videos and producing them and everything about it. But film school... films... that would make me the happiest man on earth. Needless to say, she has always known this.

My wife randomly decided last year that she might want to make videos, come to find out. Now, she didn't even nod to the fact that i had been obsessed with that my whole life. That kinda hurt. But whatever. She didn't talk about it a lot, though. Not like any amount  someone who is genuinely obsessed with it like I am would talk about it. Then one day fairly recently she mentioned she might want to go to film school. Again, something about it felt off... It hurt but I didn't quite know why. Regardless, of course I encouraged her and said yeah, maybe we can make films together one day!

Ok, so tonight, in a text, having not spoken about film school basically since she said it, she literally asked if I would be ok with, starting January, she went to film school full time, and I worked full time. Whoa.

At this point, I KNEW she was being, at the very least, incredibly insensitive. But I hoped that maybe it was accidental and that she didn't think about it I guess?

So I told her, baby, of course I support you...but you know that's been my dream since I was a kid. Don't you think you going to film school full time while I work and watch you literally fulfil my lifelong dream... Telling me about the amazing courses, the people, how much she's learning, all of it... Would quite literally eat my soul slowly. I asked her if she could at least see how that notion might seem insensitive? Like why couldn't we both do it part time at least? I asked didn't she understand how that would get my feelings?

She said ""No."" I said ""Wait, what? You can't even SEE how that would hurt to suggest that?""

She said ok, fine, she'll do something more practical. Something along those lines.

Showed no empathy, no remorse for hurting my feelings...it sucked man!

Why would my wife be doing this to me? She's been hurting me, quite dramatically, just like this... Confusing me, messing with me, lying to me, just hurting me on purpose, a lot lately, and here and there most of our relationship.

For example, when I tell her she has done something that hurts my feelings, literally EVERY TIME, she gets either upset or mad. She doesn't want to hear my reasons or how I'm being the victim again. Which hurts even more.

I've got to the point several times, especially lately, where I will literally beg her to make me feel loved. When I tell her she makes me feel small, or invisible, or irrelevant, or annoying, or unloved... She either ignores the texts for a long ass time first and then makes me feel even more of all those things with her response, or she just lashes out at me.

Am I being gaslighted? I have never been in more emotional turmoil in my life. She will profusely apologize eventually in some way, at some point, then she will build me up and make me feel so loved and I'll somehow forget all the ways she hurt me, and then right when I feel safe again, she'll randomly do something like this. What she did tonight. We were good. She asked me if I wanted to spend a bunch of time together tomorrow and basically stuff that just made me feel so special and excited. And then she did this tonight. And now she's ignoring me and is mad because I asked her to see how that would hurt and basically said I couldn't be on board with that.

So now she'll blow me off tomorrow. After lashing out at me and making me feel like crap probably tonight. Actually she just texted me. But I'm shaking so bad and don't want to read it. Please tell me what to do. 

P.S. The hardest part about it all? We have two amazing little toddlers together. 😞"	awakenedimagination	post	20.31919211078736	male	White	0.9984108209609985	na	na	na	8	relationships
"Without other concrete examples, it's hard to say whether this is part of a pattern of manipulation on your wife's part, or genuinely just you being oversensitive and personalizing something with no malicious intent behind it. You say she often hurts your feelings, but you give no examples as to how. And without further details, it's hard to understand why you see her desire to attend film school as something she's doing *to* you versus a benign goal she set for herself. Like, did your relationship somehow stop you from studying film? Is that a dream you sacrificed for her sake, or for the sake of your children? And if not, is it not equally plausible that an interest in film is something she acquired through her relationship with you and wants to study just because it brings her pleasure?

If you have other examples of her going out of her way to hurt you, by all means share them, but based just on what you've written here it sounds to me like you're jealous that she's pursuing a goal you haven't taken action to achieve for whatever reason, and you're letting it color your perception of her."	awakenedimagination	reply	na	na	na	0.9984108209609985	no	no	no	na	relationships
Genuine question- Why can't you work on films together? Because based on what you've written, the issue isn't really your wife, but your feeling sabout not fulfilling your dream of making films. And I know jealousy is hard, but it may actually benefit you to try and bond with your wife over a shared interest. Even if you personally can't go to school, you could ask her what books or other media she assigned and follow along.

Your wife has manipulating you and using you. And you need to wake up and realize that fact. She obviously has no concern or care for your feelings or your dreams.

Nothing I do is ever good enough for them

I started seeing someone last year and we both decided to take things really slow. 

They were going through a severe breakup and I’ve been going through grief due to my partner’s death. We both agreed that it would have been just sex. They explicitly told me that they didn’t want to have a relationship ever again and I said the same because I genuinely cannot see myself with anybody else.

2 to 3 months in, they started wanting more eg - hour long calls. At this point, I was still under the impression that it was just sex but they also wanted a friendship which is why they’d call me multiple times during the week. During one of these calls, they got mad at me and ended the call. The next day, they didn’t talk to me for the whole day so I got concerned and messaged them to see what was wrong because I knew that something I must have said during our call, had upset them. Ofc i was right and they said it’s because they expect a little bit more from me and for me to match their love language- I kept asking what “more” meant but they kept dodging the question so I let it go. I explained that I’m not big on physical touch as a love language due to sensory issues but I had been honest about this from the beginning. I apologised for upsetting them and told them I’d try to match their love language more. 

A few months later, we take a trip to Morocco and they tell me they’re in love with me. I’m honestly shook because I didn’t know how to react but I start reflecting on my feelings for this person to see if I also loved them. It took me a whole month to say it back but I don’t think I truly meant it, I said it because I didn’t say it back the first time (I’m a huge dickhead for this). 

A few days after, they tell me they want a relationship with me to which I reply that I can’t because I’m not over my partner and I don’t know when I will be. They drop the issue but it comes back up again in the following weeks to the point they’re crying and telling me I give them nothing and they never know what I’m thinking. I apologise and tell them that I try so hard to tell them how I feel but it’s hard for me to talk about how grief affects my relationships. 

Then we had another fight because I didn’t give them enough reassurance about an insecurity their ex had left them with (I was unaware of this but tried to find out during the fight) and they accused me of not caring about it but turning the convo sexual which wasn’t true at all. I was so perplexed by this. I explained that it wasn’t true and pulled out receipts but I still apologised for making them feel insecure. 

By this point, i was so drained. Something that was supposed to be easy, turned into something where I’m scared to be myself in fear of offending them . We solved the issue but I still felt like I can’t be myself anymore. We agreed that they’d communicate their feelings openly instead of waiting for me to guess how they feel. We also agreed that i need to go from “trying to solve issue straight away” to “listen before asking loads of questions”.

Then yesterday, they flew to china- we talked normally the whole day but they knew I was out with friends so limited replies from me. I wished them a safe flight, to get loads of sleep and to text me once they land. They reply with a really sarcastic answer to which I don’t respond. Then I get another message 15h later to say their flight wasn’t until the afternoon and I reply immediately to see how things were but they asked me “if I hadn’t messaged you, you wouldn’t have messaged me?”. I knew their flight was in the afternoon, I knew they were with their whole family, I knew how stressful they find going to the airport and driving there, I knew the sarcastic reply was a stress response so I didn’t want to make things worse and just left it. I replied saying the above and they just said “ok, see you later”. Literally just implying I don’t care about them.

I’m autistic and I know that I can miss out on some social clues but I’m actually hyper aware of everyone’s emotions and NVC so it kills me when I miss something and I hurt people. What am I missing here? I’m trying so hard to be a good person and to understand their needs and match them but I can’t help but feel that it’s never good enough and that they don’t get me. I don’t need this kind of stress in my life rn and yet, I can’t let them go because they remind me too much of my dead partner. 

I guess I just need some internet strangers to tell me I need to let them go and that the person I’m seeing right now is right in constantly getting mad at me.

Tl;dr got into a sticky situationship due to unclear boundaries but now I feel like a horrible person for always doing something wrong to this person. I think I should end this but idk how to. Am I a horrible person for having put myself in this situation and for missing clues that this person is giving me?"

You aren't missing anything except there is manipulative abou the way your partner treats you. You are falling for it by not having a clear enough sense of self to understand that this person is playing you, for whatever reason.

"I sure hope you didn't type what you typed here, which is  ""thanks for an outstanding week away my true love, it’s made me realise that I **could live a day without you** by my side.""

I'll assume you typed to her that you couldn't live a day without her by your side.

Communication IS the answer to relationships. It is the crucial answer. So what do you do now? You straight up ask her why she didn't acknowledge your message. Always be ready for a one minute conversation or an hour one, and whenever you are confused, don't let stuff go, continue to pursue an understanding. Approaching communication just from the romantic angle is a long term disaster, so you need to always remember frank and honest discussions are key."

"I’ve been with my girlfriend for the past 2 years. A year into our relationship I was hanging around her hometown group of friends she sees a handful of times during the year. 
I have been nothing but respectful to this group of friends and one time while we were on vacation playing cards with her friend group,  one of her friends says in another language that I didn’t understand that she doesn’t like me in front of me and the rest of her friends, who understand the language.   

This same girl would step on the back of my shoes when we walk and did it multiple times and would grin at me when I looked back so she deliberately was doing it. My gf confronted this girl and told her how disrespectful it was and that she can never do this again, in regards to the talking in another language incident.

In this same friend group her female cousin’s bf exists too. He always make passive aggressive jabs at me and asks me if “i’m happy to be in a relationship” and he said in front of me and my gf that “I don’t seem too happy to be dating you” even though that’s not even the case. He says this pretty much every time i’ve met them so like 4 times total. Keep in mind i’ve only met them 4 times. My gf just brushes off these jabs and she clearly sees her friends as people who can do no wrong 

After that first incident with the girl expressing her dislike to me to my face in another language i can’t understand in front of everyone, I told her that I don’t want to hang out with them. I also explained the jabs the other friend makes and I told her i don’t want to be around people who disrespect me like that. I set the expectation that I would not hang out with her friend group at casual outings but if they happen to be at her birthday, graduation, or a bigger event then i will be there as I am there to support/ celebrate her and couldn’t give two shits if her friends are there. She agreed to this expectation 9 months ago. 

She is on vacation now with a few people in that group and I obviously didn’t go because of the previous incidents. She is tipsy and she told me that me not hanging out with her friends is a dealbreaker for her and basically went against what she previously agreed to. Am I being too harsh by not hanging out with her friends anymore due to these incidents even though they are clearly so disrespectful to me?  Am I in the right for standing my ground and not allowing her to change my “boundaries” on this even though she explicitly said this is a dealbreaker now ?  Would you do the same thing I did and no longer hang out with her friends after they constantly disrespect you ? 

TL:DR My (M20) GF’s (F20) friends have been disrespectful to me and i set a boundary she initially agreed to. Now she’s saying i have to hang out with them or else it’s a dealbreaker"	Next_Mix_2263	post	30.274473210223405	male	White	0.9993128776550293	na	na	na	6	relationships

The very definition of a deal breaker/boundary is that it's a requirement or they walk. You don't want to hang with some immature jerkasses who are acting like they're not mature enough for junior high, but she demands you do. Just refuse, and if she doesn't like it, then it's time to walk. If she just wants to berate and demand and argue over it, then you need to be the one to end it. That's, again, what a deal breaker is. Make sure she knows that as you dump her.	Next_Mix_2263	reply	na	na	na	0.9993128776550293	no	no	no	na	relationships
"Hi redditors,

To start this off, after being just friends with this girl [18F] i [18M] caught feelings. I started to really like her around the time college decisions came out. I knew where she was gonna go, a school hours away and I am staying local. 

During the end of high school - summer we gradually started spending more time together. we would go out to the beach together, we would go to all the grad parties together, we would go play volleyball it was always fun when we were together there was never a moment where i was unhappy around her. After a while all her friends told me she liked me as they knew i felt the same way. BUT they said she is not really willing to do long distance nor was I. I kept my feelings inside i never told her because I knew it would probably end up in rejection. It was a lose lose situation.

As her going away party came around I really felt like telling her how I felt. But there was never a time I could catch her alone and to be completely honest i was kinda scared lol... ik great going right. I went to go see her off days later with some other people, and I wanted to tell her but she was still packing everything up we were all helping her and as soon as we finished she had to leave.

What should I do? should I text her how I feel? Leave it as it is? this is really a ""right person wrong time"" type of situation and i really hate it. Im gonna miss having her around but yeah thats about all. Looking forward to the replies!

TL;DR:
The girl i like left for college and after knowing we both liked eachother an always going out together. She wasnt willing to do a ldr and neither was I. Though i continued to like her I knew it was a lose lose situation and rejection was inevitable. I still havent told her how i feel and I regret it and dont know if i should still tell her or not."	boywithacrush1	post	11.335773291412643	male	Hispanic	0.9907838106155396	na	na	na	6	relationships

"I never thought I would be one to write one of these, yet here we are.

 I (33F) married my husband (30M)  just over a year and a half ago. We dated for six years before that, living together pretty much that entire time. We helped each other through some pretty difficult moments, and celebrated each other through the good. We may not have a ""perfect"" relationship, but I honestly feel like we have a pretty strong one. Or had a strong one, at least.

Before we got married we talked about future plans - where to live, where we saw ourselves professionally, travel, a family. I thought I heard him, and he me, and that we had a pretty parallel  projection. Over the last year or so we discussed a timeline of when to try for children, which always seemed to get pushed. He started a new job, I was finishing school, we wanted to spend time together as a married couple. Then, in February I heard him say for the first time that he didn't think he wanted kids. It was a pretty difficult conversation to have, because I have always imagined myself as a mother at some point. We talked it out and spent some time with it and ultimately decided (I thought?) that we both wanted a child after all, but would try next year. 

Then tonight happened. Seemingly out of no where he told me he doesn't want kids. Ever. And I feel so lost. Part of me can't imagine life without him. I love being married to him and the life we have built together. But I don't know how to process the loss of motherhood. How do you even grieve something you've never had? I don't know what that feels like, and I never will with him. I understand that with counseling and time, perhaps this can be worked through. Ultimately, it comes down to do I love my husband more than the idea of being a mother? The other part of me is angry. So, so angry. At the time I don't have left now to grieve the loss of a marriage and have a healthy child. The stupidity of it all is that I don't just want a kid, I want a child with him. I don't even know if I can really explain why, because every time I try the reasons sound so stupid. It feels so incredibly selfish to want this and to throw away something good because of this. 

I'm not quite sure what I'm looking for here... I'm not going to ask if we can get past this or if he will change is mind. I reached out to a therapist to hopefully help me with all that. I guess I'm just hoping to hear from others about their experiences with similar situations?

All of those things are worth consideration if the alternative is a happy marriage built on trust and honesty.

Hey there. This is a tough tough road. Genders reversed I am/was in your position. I felt so hurt I ended the relationship after her revelation. We'd been struggling with this impending decision for some time before she fully realised it wasn't just no IVF but no children. 6 months on it still hurts enough to make me feel I was too rash, didn't canvas alternate life options with her post her realisation.

" Without giving much detail, I know my husband has a very fractured relationship with his parents. Then, a couple years ago my family went through a pretty significant unexpected loss. And then my husband and I's dog suddenly died in January. When we talked last night he mentioned he thought he wanted kids at first. But, after reflecting on his relationship with his family, and loss over the last few years, and a few other things, he kind of came to the understanding a few days ago that he only wanted a kid because I did. I may be paraphrasing, but that's the general idea.

The delivery was out of the blue and coated. Almost like he couldn't quite say it, maybe because he didn't want to hurt me but most definitely also because he anticipated divorce by admitting it.

I can forgive questioning. Or changing your mind. Even if it means compatibility is no longer there, everyone can be sad but amenable and considerate and as kind as they can be as they go their own way.

 These things happen, but you were open and honest, and no one can ask for more.

But to repeatedly put the decision off, giving no hint whatsoever that you might have doubts, that this is less about timing than about having them *at all* until, finally, 18 months after marriage, 6 years after you first got together, and by the time she's verging on mid-30s and so is up against the fucking wire on time left on her body clock, you just go 'bam!' out of left field?

Nope. Nu-uh. That is not only am I leaving, it will be an acrimonious divorce and I will fucking take you to the cleaners out of *spite*, you deceitful piece of shit.

"'ve (26F)  been meeting people on online dates,and about a month ago I meet this guy (27M), our first date went very well , we had many things in common and we had the same relationship goals, we kissed on our first date and already on our second date we had sex and it was great, and we met each other 5 more times all was great , but he was going to his country for two weeks and after that I would be away for two weeks as well so we were a month apart. On the first two weeks I tried my best to keep in contact with him but I came off pushy and he sent me a message saying I was going too fast and wanted time to think so I backed off because it made me feel unappreciated, so I started seeing other people, I even saw another guy for a couple times which I didn't feel much for but we also had sex but things faded off quickly. 
Eventually I heard back from the first guy and we ended up keeping in touch every day, and when I came back we already marked a day to see each other but he called me telling me he was sick and was asking me to help him guide him on how to get better, which surprised me since he was so quick to say that we were not in a relationship.. either way once he got better we saw each other, had sex and had overall an amazing time and he asked me if I could sleep at his place and I told him I would next time I saw him , but when that day came , he felt a bit different, was more quiet , when we went to his place we started watching a movie and he looked distant, then midway we had sex but this time felt distant and right after he said that he regretted inviting me to sleep at his house and that he thought we were not right together and we should end things so I went away.
I feel so pathetic, I don't understand why things changed in literally one day, I know we were not that close but why would someone invite you to stay at their place, have sex with you and right after tell you that they don't want to see you anymore? 
On our first date he told me about how the exact same thing happened to him and how much it hurt him and yet he does that to me as well ... I told him about that and he said he did nothing wrong, that he has the right to choose if he wants me or not and I understand that of course, but why would he use me first ? Why ask me to sleep at your house then tell me in the middle of the night to leave? I don't understand how I am supposed to feel, I'm very inexperienced when it comes to dating, my most serious relationship ended terribly and it makes me wonder if I was ever supposed to be in a relationship

"We've been dating for a bit over 3 years now and we've known she's asexual for a little over 2. It's something we figured out together and I've been supportive of it. I've never tried to push sex on her or guilt her into it, and we've had a bunch of conversations about how her boundaries and how we can manage my sexual needs within those boundaries 

She is (or maybe was now) a sex-positive rather than sex repulsed asexual, so while she wasn't able to get aroused as easily, we used to have a somewhat active sex life. She's also got vaginismus, so penetration never was or will be on the table. For the first few years we made that work by just sticking to oral and hands. 

The issue is that over the past few years what little drive she had has been lost. We used to use kink to add excitement for her, but everything we tried would only work for a short while. After a while she ended up doing things with me that she didn't really want to do because she felt obligated.  It really spoiled the idea of sex with a petter

Now she can only get off if she's masturbating with no distractions, and all I can really do with her sexually is masturbating while touching her and some forms of outercourse. I have no intention of ending this relationship because it's absolutely the best I've been in, even with the sex problem. It just hurts knowing that in order to be in it, I have to accept that I'm not going to be satisfied sexually, nor wanted sexually again. It also just feels like such a huge thing to give up at a really young age. I miss the feeling of being wanted like that. It feels lonely in a way that I wasn't prepared for. 

We have had a lot of conversations about this, so don't worry about communication being an issue. It kind of was in the past but it's better now. I'm making the reddit post on her suggestion cus it's a difficult conversation to have with other people in my life, and it's hard to be fully honest with her without feeling like I'm complaining or begging I guess. 

TLDR: I'm deep into a good relationship with a really big downside of no sex, and that's a sacrifice I wasn't fully aware I was making when I got into it. Now it's kind of hard to cope with, and the idea of giving it up so young hurts.

"I'd just like to commend OP for how emotionally mature they are, starting this relationship at 19 and now still only in their early 20s and really seeming to have a fairly positive outlook on all this. This is a challenge for many relationships, having a difference in sexual desire and drive. It's certainly not exactly the same as being asexual, but it does bring about a lot of the same conversations.

I think this could just be an incompatibility that you two will have to work on throughout the lifetime of your relationship. Putting sex up on this pedestal as the most important thing (or one of the most important things) and keeping it there might further drive a wedge in the relationship, so try not to put so much pressure on it. It sounds like both of you really love each other, you don't want a non-monogamous relationship, and you want to work to make sure both of you feel secure and satisfied. 

Sexuality and desire can change throughout your lives. I know in my 20s it fluctuated like a rollercoaster. Maybe consider working with a therapist or counselor to help bridge this gap in the relationship?

I know a lot of people here are saying ""You are incompatible"" and are insinuating the relationship is doomed to fail because of this.

She'll be happier with another asexual person and you'll be happier with someone who wants to be sexual. If you're still young it's even a better time to move on and find someone you're compatible with.

"In my honest opinion, I think the people saying that you need to break up are jumping ahead. 

I've read people saying that sexdrives change over time and that's true. I, myself, have times where I don't have a need for sex, for weeks, and other times I want it multiple times a day. 

You said that she had no need to fix vaginismus and that's valid, I fixt mine in the wrong way and I still have troubles with it. Not saying that this is true but maybe look into why she has it? Some people have it because of trauma, but some don't. 

I have a feeling from the way you're telling things, that you guys have spoken about it, a lot and have found many different ways to work around it and I need to say that that is really really great and I applaud you guys for it because that's hard!

Overall I want to say that your feelings are valid, if you want to keep the relationship, maybe look into couples (and maybe individual) therapie also don't rush the ""she has no sexdrive at the moment"" it can change. Maybe also, look into spending real 1on1 time, romantic things, fun things, cosy things.. without giving the feeling that sexytime is expected or needed at the end. Maybe she has extra stress? Idk. Maybe the answer is smaller and more right in front of you.

I am a sex positive demisexual guy, my ex for 6 years was an asexual. I did not even know what these sexuality are but only after where she told me that she is an asexual/aromantic (no sexual/romantic attraction but is aroused when she sees herself getting pleasured). The boundaries was discussed on our first year. I would have sex with her but I need to be quick. Man... I thought, is this sex? REALLY? WHY AM I DEPRESSED AFTER? like it really traumatized me. I really love her and she knows that she can't give it to me that's why she suggested an open relationship but I hated the idea. I was like a zombie at year 3... I thought we could make it work but I was just miserable. It's much better to be alone than to be with her cause she's not giving any effort on our relationship as well. She was my bestfriend in highschool that's why I pushed through. So if I were you, cut your losses even if it will devastate you and  find someone compatible.

A lot of people are suggesting you should leave this relationship because you're sexually incompatible. The latter is probably true, unless you have observed an ebb and flow and you think she will regain some enjoyment of sex with you periodically. Either way, you're signing up for at best long stretches of being sexually unsatisfied. You could try non-monogamy of some kind if you want to have a sexual relationship without losing the love you have with this partner, but it would need to be well-communicated and fair, and I am not sure how possible that will be with the imbalance you have. You probably will end up leaving this relationship, especially because you two are both so young and have plenty of time to find someone more compatible with you. It can be painful to let go of someone you love, especially when neither party has wronged the other, but you can still maintain a friendship with her that preserves the best things about the intimacy you experience now—how well you know each other and happy you are spending time together—once you let the dust settle and you both move on from your romantic feelings.

Vaginismus is completely treatable. 

It honestly sounds like more is going on here than just being asexual. Asexuality is about attraction, and libido is often unaffected. I'm ace and partnered sex is still enjoyable and fun! I don't initiate as often as my partner because sometimes it simply doesn't occur to me, but once initiation is done it's not different from being with an allo partner.

So we've just had to agree to accept that one day when it just isn't enough for me, well have to seperate.	altaccountaa	follow-up	na	na	na	0.02235293574631214	strong	no	no	na	relationships

Asexuality can absolutely involve plenty of masturbation. Not for all asexuals, of course, but most certainly for some. Asexual just means a lack of sexual attraction/lack of desire to interact sexually with *other people*, not an absence of sex drive entirely. Not trying to invalidate your post, just thought I'd point that out.	altaccountaa	reply	na	na	na	0.02235293574631214	no	no	no	na	relationships
Sorry that you got hurt man, but no need to talk shit about someone you don't know.

"No, that's not an option really. At least not anytime soon. We have kind of talked about it, and it's not something she's comfortable with. She may not be able to feel sexual attraction, but she understands that for people who aren't asexual that sex has a level of intamacy that she's not comfortable with sharing with another person. She's mentioned she may be open to the idea in the future, but it's unlikely and I'm not counting on it. 

This isn't as much of a reason, but she does also really resent the idea that if you're asexual that you just need to be okay with your partner fucking other people.

Actually this is probably a story you should listen to. A good gauge of how much you are pressuring yourself to accomodate her is how well you would handle if she met someone else after you and became more sexual with him. What if you spend a few more years like this and then she finds someone that she feels is worth the effort to treat the vaginismus and have sex with.

The reality is comprising is at the core of any relationship, but there is a point where there isn't a compromise you're or they are about to make.i believe they call it a boundary.
That is when you're not able to maintain the relationship.

Me M23 and Gf F23 , she wants to break up, what should I think

Hello, 
 So quick recap , we’ve been together for 2 years , we had our ups and downs but we managed to stay together even if it wasn’t always easy and correct, but I love her. 
 This week I got a phone call , an employer wants me to work for them as an engineer, great salary, great opportunities , work car etc . There’s a thing though, it’s an hour drive from where I live actually ( me and her don’t live together yet) . It’s only an hour drive and maybe on of the best career opportunities I may have, I instantly thought that we may finally live together. Told her and she instantly said that I chose a job over her , that I want her to leave her job for mine , that idc about her etc. She said that she would never join me there that I’m just an egoistic piece of shit and that I did not think about her at all. I wanted to go there and just live with her finally us both. “I will not go to this shit city”
I feel bad cause I love this girl , and I do not have this opportunity in my city as I’m currently unemployed. My friends told me that she’s egocentric as she may have been before but she changed in my opinion. She doesn’t want to continue and said that we will break up when I leave …
 What should I think of it ? Is she correct ? I kind of understand if it would be on the other side of the world but it’s only an hour drive. I don’t and can’t force her but I feel if your not willing to make an sacrifice for your partner it tells a lot , I know it’s a big one but still. It’s not 5000km away we would visit friends and family every weekend. 
Thank you for your advice or opinion 

TL;DR!
Gf wants broke up with me because I got a job an hour drive away from where we are currently staying. She considers me selfish, and said that she would never join me there…"	kerkasmokecrack	post	22.471563935775695	male	White	0.9973931312561035	na	na	na	10	relationships

"TLDR: I need some guidance on ending a relationship that I am no longer as emotionally connected in. 

I'll start by saying my partner (29M) and I (27F) have been together for 6 years. We rent an apartment (the lease is up soon but the landlord may offer us an extension). 

I haven't been happy in a while, mainly due to my own mental health. I have been struggling , and so has my partner. 

We have had many uncomfortable talks in recent times, mainly about the state of our relationship. I felt there were many more problems in it than he did. I won't go into it but I have come to the conclusion that my feelings for him have faded, and I can no longer really see us together long term. I guess this isn't really surprising considering how young we both were when we got together, but it is still surprising nonetheless. I never thought I'd be in this position. 

This is through no fault of his own, as he is a wonderful man who has always tried to make me happy, and I feel so guilty and ashamed of myself that I can't love or support him in the way that he deserves. I feel like stringing him along in this relationship when my feelings are no longer there isnt fair to him. He deserves to be happy. He deserves to be able to focus on his goals. He deserves a partner who can appreciate and love him for the person he is, better than I can. I almost wish he would just do something horrible to make this easier. 

Breaking up with him would devastate him and I would be really worried how he would cope in the aftermath, and I'm really not sure how to approach it. I'm also really struggling to come to terms with the fact that I will hurt him, as this is the last thing I want. I have always tried to be considerate of his feelings and and this at times has led to me putting him before myself, which in turn isn't fair to me. 

Can anyone offer me any advice or something because I really just don't know what to do here."	ThrowRAStore5477	post	17.994908312661067	female	White	0.996651828289032	na	na	na	1	relationships

"My girlfriend and I have been going out for about 5 months. 

I have had feelings throughout our whole relationship that made me feel insecure about the fact that she has way more male friends than female friends and talks to them far more often than she does her female friends. A lot of these friends are my friends too and I don't have anything against that, it's just that she stays friends with people that are clearly into her and trying to make moves on her, and she doesn't put them down she seems to lead them on more and more as she has a bit of a flirtatious personality without realising it. 

I have managed to mostly get past that but recently she was added by a guy on snap and said she just wanted to know where he got her snap from then she would unfriend him, but she has decided not to unfriend him. It was clear that his intention when adding her was to make a move as he sent a thirst trap to her immediately, but then he found out she is 16 and he is 24 and it makes me feel weird it seems a bit wrong for them to be talking when that's how it started out. When I told her it made me uncomfortable she told me he was just funny so she wasn't going to stop talking to her, but their humour is like calling each other daddy and stuff and it makes me feel awful. 

I feel bad for telling her how I felt about it but she had spent so much time on her phone talking to him when she was out with me and our friends, and it made me feel like she'd rather talk to him than me.

I don't plan on asking her to make female friends or ditch female friends but I can't help these feelings and I just want to know if I'm a bad person for feeling like this.

"If she’s a woman and straight or bisexual. Male friends are a big no if she ever hangs out with one alone or talks one on one with one. 
Male acquaintances or friends in group settings are OK. 
Texting 1 on 1, not cool unless it’s about a specific topic she’s passionate about, and that’s it. Or if it’s just a quick comment or something that’s fine. But long paragraphs about eachother’s day? NOPE.  

Really it just comes down to how much you respect eachother. It’s never respectful for a couple that is straight, to go hang out alone with someone of the opposite sex (unless you’re in a open relationship). 
There’s just no real reason for it, unless it’s a group setting because group settings are different. 

If you feel uncomfortable with her talking to someone, and she just dismisses it right away without either making a compromise or reassuring you enough  to make you comfortable. Then it’s your bad if you stay in that relationship, instead you should just leave because that’s not going to end well. 

It’s not that she’ll cheat or flirt, but men typically have ulterior motives when talking to women even if they know they’re taken. And it’s not even a real friendship at that point anyways so it’s pointless for her to talk to them. 

If she had male friend before you guys got into a relationship and you knew about it, then you have no right to say anything about that, but if it’s a ‘new friend’ and it makes you uncomfortable and no change or reassurance is made to make you feel comfortable, best to walk away."

"6 months is quite early. It takes about three years to get to know each other. But here are some points.

You will be closer to each other than before. While love seeks closeness, desire needs distance and mystery.

Take enough time for yourself. The things which drew you to each other, you saw from a distance. Being self-reliant, truly enjoying yourself, being in your element...

Communicate. A lot. And then some more. Almost every emotion, anything you feel is a chance to learn more about each other. Stay curious. Just because you see each other every day, doesn't mean you know each other.

Express appreciation. A lot. Take nothing for granted.

Learn the love language of your partner.

Take enough time to learn about each other's day. Whenever you come home, kiss. At least seven seconds.

You talked about the finances. Be very clear. Don't hold back. Have three accounts, one joint account for all your shared expenses. Pay into it depending on how much each makes. Keep an account for yourself.

Make an effort to ask what you can do for each other. Feel comfortable with asking for something. The other person will be happy to be able to do something for you.

Have a lot of sex.

"6 months is pretty quick to move in together, but if you're gonna do it... 

Best tip is to be honest if something is bothering you. Don't ignore small irritants thinking ""oh, it's not that big a deal."" Small irritations pile up to big arguments, and the best way to avoid that is to nip problems in the bud ASAP. And it goes both ways! If your boyfriend says something is bothering him, take it seriously and don't just dismiss it if it's something that doesn't matter to you.

Second piece of advice? You're a team, and you approach problems as a team. Your goal is to work together on issues. Even if the issue involves your partner, it's not ""you versus me,"" it's ""us versus an issue."" If you turn problems into ""you versus me,"" it becomes about winning, not resolving things. And if your goal is to remain a couple, there's no real ""winning.""

Last tip? You both still need space. Make time for yourselves. You may not have a ton of physical space (depending on your living situation), but you two still need your own areas and time to relax alone.

6 months would be way too soon for moving in together for me personally, but since you’re doing it, i recommend having your own space somewhere in the apartment where you can do things alone and still have time with yourself. alone time is important. also discuss how much time you’d want to spend together while in the house. definitely talk about your wake up and going to bed times, noise level you’re comfortable with, tidiness/messiness level, and split up the weekly chores. as long as you discuss your issues that may arise with kindness and patience all will be okay.	marianasartdesigns	reply	na	na	na	0.0015387784224003553	weak	strong	no	na	relationships

We had such great times together, never fought and we always enjoyed each other's company, and it really seemed like it came outta nowhere.

"This is the third part of the post that I made if you aren't aware of what happened the TLDR at the bottom sums up the first part pretty well. First of all, I want to thank everyone who has been following along and providing their insights – your support has meant a lot to me during this incredibly challenging time.So here's where things stand now. After a series of heart-wrenching turns, my girlfriend dropped another bombshell on me: she's pregnant, and it turns out that the child is my cousin's husband's. We were both shocked and devastated by this revelation. We decided to take a DNA test to confirm the paternity, and the results confirmed that the child isn't mine. We then reached out to my cousin's husband, and his DNA test confirmed that he is the father.This whole situation has pushed us to the brink emotionally.

 My girlfriend is considering terminating the pregnancy, but if she decides to keep the baby, she wants me to step up and be the child's stepfather. While I do still love her, the idea of raising a child that isn't biologically mine is a heavy burden to bear. I'm torn and confused about what to do.After much reflection and reading your comments, I'm seriously considering breaking up with my girlfriend. The weight of all these revelations and the emotional toll they've taken on me have become almost unbearable. Even the potential of moving forward with the relationship feels like too much to handle both emotionally and mentally. I've expressed this to my girlfriend, explaining that I need space and time to process everything.

Her reaction was heartbreaking. She said, ""That really hurts,"" and began to plead with me to stay by her side. She professed her love for me and her belief that we can overcome this together. She kissed me and assured me that we'll find a way to work things out. While I acknowledge that she's trying her best to salvage our relationship, I can't ignore the fact that I'm struggling to see a way forward.As she cried and apologized, telling me how sorry she is, and expressing her love, it was a gut-wrenching moment. I still have deep feelings for her, but this situation has taken a toll on me that I'm not sure I can fully recover from. I'm left feeling emotionally drained, and the prospect of continuing our relationship feels like too much to bear.

TL;DR of Initial Post: Dated my girlfriend for 2 years, broke up briefly but still talked, decided to give the relationship another shot. Discovered she had an affair with my cousin's husband during the break. Uncertain how to feel – technically not cheating, but the family involvement is upsetting. Wondering if I should tell my cousin, who doesn't know about the affair due to her husband's secrecy. Family is religious, making it more complicated. Looking for advice on handling the situation."

"She sure didn't have love for you when she was rawdogging your cousin's husband.

If you attempt to help raise this child, you will be reminded of her infidelity every single time you look at them. There's absolutely no way that would be healthy for you or the child.

Yes, you should tell your cousin. She deserves to know she's been betrayed.

You should also break up with your GF, because her asking you to help raise a child made by her cheating is WILDLY inappropriate and basically proves she hasn't learned her lessons here. She'll cheat again. Might actually be smart enough to use protection next time, tho.

Edit: not her cheating, technically. Doesn't actually matter. If she's willing to destroy one marriage, she'll destroy yours too."	Ok-Mortgage-3903	reply	na	na	na	0.012211641296744347	no	no	no	na	relationships

"My “fiancé” (24M) and I(24F) have been together for 5 years and have three young children together. Having been through three pregnancies all very close together, and having to deal with PPD, while also growing into my role as a mother, has been pretty hard on me developmentally, and on our relationship. I love being a family and I think he is an amazing father. He’s attentive to them, we make a great team, and we both have the same priorities as parents. We take our kids out all the time for adventures. We also never disagree about finances, which I know can be a big issue for couples. 

A big issue of our relationship is that we don’t get enough time to just be a couple. I know this happens to pretty much all couples when they have young children, and it will likely get easier with time as the kids get older. By the time the kids are all asleep at night, I’m usually ready to pass out myself. We don’t go on many dates, but I’m trying to work on that now that I’m a month post-partum. 

While pregnant, I was not very interested in sexual intimacy. I had a pretty bad umbilical hernia, and severe anemia. On top of that, I was just exhausted from chasing after toddlers all day when I wasn’t at my (physically demanding) job. On Mothers Day of all days, he asked me to look something up on his phone. I accidentally found porn open, which was a big deal to me because we both dislike pornography and he had told me he doesn’t watch it. (If you watch porn, no judgement here! It’s just personal preference.) I wasn’t snooping, and didn’t bring it up until he asked why I seemed upset. We talked about it, and he explained that he had to watch it because I’m not- y’know, providing for him. Men have hormones and needs. I felt pretty heartbroken at first, but I understand why he was watching it and I’m not holding it against him. I believe he’s loyal to me and would never actually cheat on me, plus as I said, he’s a great father and life partner. 

The main issue I’m having that makes me write this is that, around the time he was watching porn, he started making comments about how “tons of women are constantly checking him out”, flirting with him, giggling to their friends, etc. and that it seems like women think it’s weird that I’m not giving him more attention? I asked him who he was talking about, and he wouldn’t tell me. When I pressed, he told me he had made it up to try to make me jealous so I would give him more attention. I just felt bad after he said that and reassured him that he didn’t need to do that, and apologized for not giving him enough of my attention. 

Now he still brings it up though, and he has never told me who is supposedly giving him all this attention, but he has indicated it includes some of our female friends. It only makes me uncomfortable because he seems to like the attention and focus on it too much. I feel like generally, even if a guy did get a lot of female attention, he wouldn’t be bringing it up to his girlfriend or even paying so much attention to it. He actually said to me “I can smell their pheromones, it’s an exchange of pheromones.” Idk if that’s supposed to be gross to me, or if I should appreciate his honesty. I also wonder if he could be simply reading too much into girls giving him platonic attention or just being nice to him or something. I know I might come across as immature, but I really just want to get a better understanding of I guess the male psyche, lol. Should I be worried about the way he seems to obsess about female attention? Is it harmless, or a serious indication of his dissatisfaction with our relationship? 

Sorry if this post is too long or doesn’t make a ton of sense. If anyone has questions for clarification just lmk!

TLDR; my fiancé seems dissatisfied with our sex life and keeps bringing up attention from other women- any advice or insight is appreciated."	princess_seren	post	32.87790253617817	female	White	0.0014412582386285067	na	na	na	6	relationships

"Probably should consider couples counseling or something if you want to work on things. He isn't really communicating his needs/concerns in a healthy way. Maybe he doing things with bad intentions or maybe he is just a bit slow. You would know better than we do.

He should probably understand why sex isn't the same at the moment but might need it explained more bluntly to get his head straight. Maybe knowing it's a temporary state or something you two are working on would help. Healthy ways to work on it or deal with it would be very important. He isn't doing anything well about it right now.

Him getting out his sexual frustrations solo can be reasonable and he can do so discreetly within whatever bounds you're comfortable with. You can establish some boundaries about his behavior in general. You can tell him that his behavior hurts you and the relationship when you and his future child needs his support. Also that you want to work on things together to improve the relationship.

"To start, I’m really close with her, she’s my best friend. (Since we were like 5 or something small). We were hanging out over the weekend and she told me some really concerning things about her ex and it really upset me. I wanted to cry. I don’t remember how we got onto it but she told me fairly casually like I had already been told how her ex had restrained her twice when they were in a relationship. Once she realised she hadn’t already told me her demeanour changed and she kinda looked down and said “Oh… I thought I told you”. I asked her more about it obviously as I was concerned. She basically told me that on two separate occasions he had restrained her and by holding tightly onto her wrists -leaving red marks - when they were both arguing. He apparently wasn’t angry but said it was to “calm her down” (( WTF)) but it’s not like she was trying to hit him in any way so I don’t see how that’s right at all to do that. I asked her if he ever was physical/ angry at her another times and she said no she has never been hit. And he was never angry at her except one time he broke her string lights by yanking on them in a rage while in her face . Obviously I found this all very disturbing and feel like a bad friend for not knowing any of this and stopping it. 

I’m glad she broke up with him but I’m worried she will go back to him eventually as they seem to have an on and off relationship and he owes her money that he is slowly paying back. she told me he would agree to pay for things/ split things but she would pay and then he didn’t pay back, only now paying back after they broke up (or shortly before?) I’m not sure what my friend said exactly I can’t remember but I think he might be doing it so he stays connected to her longer. She also told me he would take her bath products without asking and then when she asked him about it he would lie about it until she asked him many times (she said she could tell as he would use large amounts)and she told him it was hurtful but apparently he kept doing it. with drinks and food etc as well, even after expressing her hurt. I know he would call her emotional and was mean about her crying more than half the time. She says that he had good qualities too though and that he was never bad to her in any way when it came to “the bedroom”. I believe her about that especially as we talked in length about things, but I also think she might be in denial about how bad he is overall. He might not be all bad but it sounds like the beginnings of something really dark. I’m worried she doesn’t think it’s as bad as it really is.

I don’t know how well written this post is , I just needed to vent because it’s just a lot And to get outsiders opinions/advice on the situation. I think it doesn’t paint a very good picture… I’m still processing what she has told me and I think she seems to be processing is all still even though it’s been 6 months since they broke up. They were together this time round almost 2 years. They were together for about 5 months at around ages 18. she was the one who broke up both times if it matters.

 Am I right to be concerned?

"I was your friend in a relationship like this once. This is how my friends and family helped me:

[1] ""He has good qualities:"" By emphasizing that a relationship can end for any reason. No one has to be a villain or a bad guy or evil in order for the other party to justify breaking things off. This means he, like everyone else (although admittedly for him it will be more exaggerated), will have a mix of bad and good qualities, and it's ok. It's ok, and it's possible, to find someone who will be great between the sheets and care for her when she's crying.

[2] ""I'll never find someone like him again:"" By agreeing with me; probably not. She'll find someone different, but she is a loving person, and a good person, and she will find deep love again for someone who she probably hasn't met yet. If she doesn't want to be single, she won't be.

[3] ""I still need money/stuff from him:"" By helping me out with new stuff if needed, but sometimes I just had to pay the convenience charge of removing someone from your life. She might never get the money back, and that has to be ok.

Just be there for her, always. Always have an open door. 

I also had to help myself:

[1] I had an amazing therapist.

[2] I went completely no-contact. Blocked and deleted on all platforms with zero ""cheats"" (after the day of our breakup, I never spoke to him again).

[3] I went on a bit of a dating spree so I could see what was out there -- and this really helped me sustain #2. After seeing how many decent people were out there, it was easy to stay no-contact.

Not at all. It's completely reasonable (and in fact, mature thinking) to want to built a relationship before having sex. A year may be a bit unrealistic as a timeline for sex, but 3 to 6 months (waiting until you are completely comfortable and ready) is not out of line.

"want a relationship where I get know a guy for 4-5 dates before anything physical happens. I don't want to have sex before I know him for a year or so(I'm a virgin). I want to know everything about him. His childhood, his dreams, what makes him happy, what kind of music he likes, whether he likes cats or dogs, his hobbies. I want to buy him gifts and make him happy. He should be the center of my world(not in an obsessive way). I like holding hands and giving or receiving flower. My friends say this is childish and rare to find. Is it true?

No, it's not childish or immature. It's actually pretty normal to want to know the person you sleep with. However those type of people might be harder to find on apps and places where hookup-culture is more popular.	ResolveSilver9430	reply	na	na	na	0.001495801261626184	no	no	no	na	relationships
"Me (15f) and my boyfriend (17m) are in a long distance relationship. He came up with his sister for a week, and I've been seeing him every day.

For past context for our situation, since the very beginning of our relationship I knew he didn't like my bodytype. I'm not ""obese"", but I am overweight. At the beginning of our relationship, 5 months ago, I was around 165lb, so I was overweight and quite chubby. He has said he prefers skinny girls, but he still loves my body. He knows how insecure I am about my weight and body, and knows I have self-harmed because of it. My boyfriend is quite small, he's reaching underweight for his height.

So onto now, yesterday we were together chilling on the couch. He gave me his phone, and we were looking through it together. I was NOT snooping without him knowing, he was watching it with me. We were looking through his messages with his best friend, they talk quite a lot and my boyfriend often talks about our relationship. I came across a message.

He asked his friend how to ""hypothetically"" tell a girl to get skinnier (talking about me). My boyfriend said ""its not my fault shes unhealthy""...they went back and forth and my boyfriend decided that saying ""he wants me to be healthy"" is the best bet. 

Now I remember this exact conversation me and him had. He said to me that he wants me to be healthier how he is and to eat better foods and maybe go outside a bit more. I was upset, but after a while we made up— this was 2 months ago, late June. 

Yesterday, after seeing that message with him he immediately grabbed his phone from me and I knew he felt so bad that I saw it. I kept hugging him and told him I'm okay (I was hurt.) When I got home though, my emotions just came out and I argued with him and just told him how I really felt. We made up, he said that his preferences doesn't matter anymore and that he loves me no matter what. I told him that I'm trying to lose weight. He sees that I eat less, and I barely eat when I'm around him. I said I've lost 6lb after the 5 days of seeing him, and honestly I think I have an eating disorder. He says he wants me to eat, and that he doesn't want me to starve myself but I just got even more upset with him. I know he loves me, but I just don't know if he loves my appearance like he says he does. 

I don't know if I want help or advice on this, or just to tell someone and let this off my chest.

TLDR; saw a message between my boyfriend and his friend asking how to ask me to get skinner."	jly_fsh	post	13.213613439355651	female	White	0.008182436227798462	na	na	na	3	relationships
"You don't have to be with someone who doesn't make you feel attractive. Nothing has to even be wrong with a relationship for you to decide it's not the best one for you. You're way too young to spend your time with someone who makes you feel crappy and encourages you to pick up poor eating habits. 

If you want to lose weight because YOU want to lose weight, that's one thing and you can do it in a healthy way. If you want to lose weight because you feel insecure over someone who makes you feel crappy, that's not a space you should be in. Six pounds is a lot to lose in five days. ED is a really slippery slope and I encourage you to talk to your parents or your doctor about it.

"These ppl telling you to leave him are crazy. He went out of his way to try and find a way to express something he felt in a way that would be best received by you. If he was rude about it that would be different but he clearly prioritized how you would feel in the conversation and tried his best to get his point across without hurting you. 

It's ok that you are upset and that's a normal reaction to finding out this information but I'd suggest focusing more on the fact that instead of being an asshole or even just telling you without regard for your feelings he went out of his way to try and be respectful and gentle with you. 
You can ask that he not have conversations about your body with other people in the future i think that's a fair thing to ask if you truly don't want that (although unless he was going into detail i don't think anything he said was wrong to say to a friend). But i really wouldn't break up over this like others are recommending. 
By asking/telling people on Reddit how you feel right now you are basically doing the same thing he was trying to do with his friend which is asking how to go about a tricky situation in the relationship."	jly_fsh	reply	na	na	na	0.008182436227798462	weak	no	no	na	relationships
"This might be a bit of a long post, but I want to make sure I include all the relevant information. Using a throwaway account to protect my fiancé's privacy.

My fiancé (24F) and I (24M) have been together for around 2 years, although we have known each other for a lot longer. She has always had issues with her body image and her relationship with food. Until recently these issues only came up sporadically and were manageable, but recently things have been getting worse.

**Background:**

My fiancé grew up with a father who constantly commented on her eating and exercise habits, and a mother and grandmother who constantly called themselves fat and went on a never-ending series of fad diets. As a result of living in this environment, my fiancé and her siblings have all suffered from different eating disorders and body image issues throughout their lives. From early in high school to mid-way through college my fiancé suffered from bulimia, and until about a year and a half ago she was still restricting how much food she ate. She gained some weight (10-20 pounds) when she started eating a normal amount of food, but she is still a perfectly healthy weight and wouldn't be considered ""fat"" by any reasonable person. In the time since she has gained the weight, she has seemed much happier and healthier. Among other things, she no longer suffers from constant migraines. After some initial panic, it seemed for a while she seemed like she had accepted that her new habits and weight were healthy. She felt confident and labelled her current weight as her ""equilibrium weight"". Recently her body image has been suffering and she has started to exhibit a number of concerning behaviors. She used to be very confident in her appearance, but despite being stunningly beautiful and a very hard worker, she has been calling herself fat and lazy. Recently it briefly seemed that she was finally becoming more confident, but in the last few days things have hit a new low.

**The problem:**

In recent months my fiancé's negative body image episodes have been getting more frequent and more intense. I won't list everything for the sake of time, but here are a few examples from recent weeks. Each of these events triggered a period of my fiancé starving herself or heavily restricting her food intake with constant calorie counting, sometimes eating well under 1000 calories a day for long periods of time.

1. My fiancé went shopping with her best friend. My fiancé believes that she was skinnier than the friend before, but that the friend is skinnier now, and she told me that being the ""bigger friend"" makes her self-conscious. In reality they are similar in size, but I think my fiancé's negative self-image is causing her to perceive things this way. I don't know if this is relevant, but the friend also has body image issues and frequently speaks negatively of herself and has also previously expressed being jealous of my fiancé's appearance.
2. We were watching a TV show together, and after we turned off the show, she complained that she was ""fatter"" than one of the female characters. The character in question is ""the pretty one"" in the generic tv show formula and in the episode we had just watched the character was bragging about how skinny she was.
3. She was talking on the phone with her mom, and her mom mentioned that she (the mom) had lost weight from her current online fad diet. My fiancé did the math and realized that she is now 10 pounds heavier that her mom, despite being one inch shorter. She seems to think that being any heavier than her mom automatically makes her ""fat"", and I've also noticed that these negative body image episodes tend to occur more frequently when she spends more time around her parents.

When this first started she would tell me in between the episodes what I could do to help, so I always make sure to do these things, but it doesn't seem like it's helping much anymore. I make sure that I always eat when she eats, and additionally that I always eat more than her. I also frequently compliment her on her appearance, which is easy as the added weight looks very natural on her, and I would be complimenting her even if she wasn't feeling insecure. Additionally, I've bought her a bunch of new clothes that fit her well since her old clothes were too tight and making her feel fat.

At first all it took for her to feel confident again was a little bit of reassurance that she is beautiful and that her value as a person is not dependent on her weight, but recently nothing I say or do has seemed to help much. The last few days have been especially bad. Two days ago she spent a lot of time looking at old pictures from when she was 18 and talking about how much skinnier she was. Phrases like ""Those shorts would never fit me now"" were common. Yesterday we went to the beach and she had me take a bunch of pictures of her in her bikini, I believe with the intent of posting one on Instagram to try and boost her confidence. She looked amazing. However, once she looked at the photos, she claimed that she looked ""fat"" in all of them. She hasn't eaten anything since and it's been over 24 hours.

Earlier today I tried to get her to eat something and she refused, then angrily told me to ""stop talking about her weight"". I'm at a loss for what to do here. I don't want to be to controlling or demanding because it may make her uncomfortable talking to me about it, but I also can't let her continue with this unhealthy behavior.

My only ideas right now are below, but I'm not exactly enthusiastic about them. (EDIT: I'm aware that these are not good ideas, I've included them to demonstrate that I have no idea what else to do)

1. I refuse to eat unless she does and hope her concern for me outweighs her insecurities. (This seems like it sets a bad example and would send the wrong message)
2. I cover up the nutrition labels from all the food in the house so she can't count calories. (Focusing on calories at all may backfire)
3. Create some sort of rewards system, like if she eats 3 meals a day for 3 days straight, I buy her something she wants (Might make her feel that I'm treating her like a child)

I am worried that if I don't figure out what to soon, things will become much worse and have long-term severe or fatal impacts on her health. What can I do to help her accept that her behavior is unhealthy and that she is perfect how she is? My fiancé is a beautiful person inside and out, and I want her to see herself the way I see her.

**TL;DR:** My fiancé seems to be getter closer and closer to a full-blown eating disorder and I want to help before it's too late."	Efficient-Study1925	post	29.131215522370496	female	White	0.0161136444658041	na	na	na	6	relationships

"Look, the root cause is her inner monologue. She got a toxic inner critic developed through a lifetime of shaming from her primary caregivers. Everything they said to her, she is now saying to herself. Any evidence or sign reinforcing the words from her inner critic will feed into a vicious cycle of self hate, self berating, self shame and so forth. Nothing short of breaking this cycle will fix the issue.

Doesn’t matter how much you try to fix the external factors, it won’t fix the inner problem.

The only viable option is professional help.

As her partner, do what you can for helping her seek professional help. 

You can take the first step and talk to a professional yourself.

If she refuses to seek help, you are allowed to state that you cannot see a future in this relationship as it will not be a healthy environment to bring up kids in with body image issues running rampant.

"I have a 'small appetite'; I have crohns'; I'm weird about food sometimes. Upfront. That is where I'm coming from. My partner is a type 1 diabetic. We've been together six years.

We mostly have good communication, but I don't know how to communicate/articulate this.

I do most of the cooking in the house. Even when my partner makes stuff I can't have, they usually ask me to season it (without taste testing!). I love flavour and consider myself a fairly competent home cook, if nothing professional.

Anything I don't eat within an hour of it being ready will be taken by my partner. Sometimes I just want to digest a little before having leftovers!

I can't even keep snacks in the house because they will be eaten.

I've brought it up a few times and just been brushed off, because I do leave leftovers of certain dishes (chili, stew) which are rough on my digestive system.

If I don't finish something within a couple hours, I 'obviously didn't really want it'. My tendency is to save leftovers for lunch.

I fully and completely recognise that this is a really stupid thing to be bothered by, but I just... am.

&#x200B;

Why?????tldr my boyfriend enjoys food 'too much' for me???? And I think it's triggering some sort of sore spot but I don't know why

&#x200B;

EDIT: Okay, there is context which didn't occur to me before but IS relevant.My partner is very insecure about their weight. They look amazing tbh and the chub is moreso from beer than food. But insecurity is kinda silly sometimes. When I have brought up food before it has kinda quickly become a weight thing (I'm just skinny because I'm sick; I'm not judgemental).I moved in with my partner around... six months?? after they moved out from their parents' home. I had been living alone for five years or so at the time. Having to learn to cook for myself is why I learnt to cook.

EDITED AGAIN: After I finish cooking, I plan on putting a portion (or two!) away in the fridge for myself for later. I'll still make big meals, but I have confirmed leftovers. Going to be properly labelled and if he takes those then it almost looks like ED territory-- which was my concern.   


EDITED ONCE AGAIN: This isn't like, a story. I am not being starved. I still eat more than enough. Please stop reading too much into this. I came into this asking to help articulating why I felt uncomfortable with this situation, not asking for like, an excuse to leave.

"You don't need to comment on the WHY of the situation. (It doesn't matter if he has an eating disorder, or if he's worried about his weight.) You should focus on how his actions make you feel and how they impact your life because he's essentially being rude to you. If you buy a box of cookies and he eats the entire thing without leaving any for you, or he eats leftovers in the fridge that are clearly labeled for you, that is just plain rude behavior. 

Your argument should be that you plan your week thinking certain food is going to be available, but when you turn around it's completely gone, and he didn't have the foresight to save any for you or share it with you. It's almost like he doesn't care that you didn't get any.

My house has small snack bins for each person. The rules are you cannot take snacks out of someone else's bin. The benefits are twofold: nobody steals your favorite snacks; and if you eat all your snacks too quickly, there's no more until the next grocery trip. It helps to manage snacking behavior.

It is not a really stupid thing to be bothered by. It’s a totally reasonable thing to be bothered by and probably also indicative of a larger issue, which is why you are finding yourself upset by it. It’s not about him eating a bit of food. It is about you explicitly stating something to your partner (“Because of my digestive issues, sometimes I eat a little bit at one time and a little bit later”/“I am saving these leftovers for lunch tomorrow”) and him completely disregarding it (“you obviously don’t want it”). It’s also just rude as hell to take someone else’s food when it’s clearly theirs! If you were putting your lunch in the fridge at work and a coworker kept taking it, you’d be pissed at that coworker right? Food preparation, grocery shopping, meal planning etc. are all things that take mental and physical labour, not to mention money. When he eats something you were planning to have later, you have to do more of that work. Anyways, this is a seemingly long rant about food but it’s really about respect, communication and him taking your dietary issues seriously. I would sit him down and ask why he doesn’t believe you when you explicitly state why you’re putting away leftovers, and why he thinks it’s okay for him to make you always scramble to plan another meal.	vulgar-resolve	reply	na	na	na	0.025271642953157425	weak	no	no	na	relationships

"I have an eating disorder and have definitely eaten family members’ food even when I logically knew it was wrong. Foods are like a drug to me, and I CANNOT CONTROL MYSELF. I am ashamed every time I eat someone’s food, and have asked family members to hide my binge foods from me so that I cannot see it and get triggered to eat it. Most of my binge triggers are things like snacks and cereal, so it is easier to hide than refrigerated meals, for instance. 

I would suggest using opaque Tupperware containers or using an opaque plastic bag to cover your leftovers so that your partner can’t see it in the fridge (if simple labeling doesn’t work). For myself, I also like freezing my leftovers so that I can’t binge it as “conveniently” lol, and most foods reheat well even after freezing. If your partner gets to the leftovers before it even goes into the fridge, you should cool the food and hide it away as soon as possible. Don’t leave the food unattended on the table.

This wasn't about a lack of food in the household. We had more than enough food. But leftovers and snacks and prepared meals would disappear and we couldn't rely on them to be there when we went to take our lunch to work, or eat the other half of our donuts.

I think the poster is enquiring about why your partner is cooking with foods you can’t tolerate when they cook, and I agree with this.  I have crohns and eat very little too.  I do the most cooking generally as he works out of the house more than me, but some days including today he cooks.  I don’t cook food he dislikes unless I cook an alternative (so I like and can tolerate broccoli on occasion which he loathes so I cook broccoli and the evil cabbage he enjoys) when he cooks he cooks a meal that I can eat the majority of, today we had roast dinner, he cooked and only served me the bits I can eat, when I have to prep for a colonoscopy he cooks my favourite safe meal for when we get home.  It’s shockingly selfish to not only eat your saved leftovers of food you can tolerate but to then cook meals constituting foods you can’t eat.  You have very good reason to feel uncomfortable with the situation, you are being disregarded and that’s not nice at all.  Possibly it’s not a leaving situation but it is concerning, you have a lifetime of crohns ahead of you, even if you get into remission and can eat whatever you fancy it can come back suddenly at anytime (I just had a good solid few years in remission, the last few months we’ve had to plan everything around my food, my husband spent a road trip across Canada and America only eating at places that had mash potatoes and planning routes and emergency stops for toilets.  He teased me, yes, but made sure I was comfortable every step) you need a loving supportive partner in life and right now I’m not sure that’s what you’re getting.  Also, it’s not his eating habits, it’s him taking your safe food, meaning you have to take the time to prepare more.	vulgar-resolve	reply	na	na	na	0.025271642953157425	no	strong	no	na	relationships

 1. Things stay as they are in this same path where he disrespects your boundaries around your food. He may start disrespecting even more boundaries if he hasn't already.

"Got over an immensely painful first breakup months ago, and I started liking this guy who was everything my ex was not- smart, ambitious, hard working, really shy. I asked him if he ever wanted to hang out, and we did and had a great time (although it was a platonic and very casual). 

We made plans to hang out again but that never happened because we both got busy with uni stuff. That very weekend, I ended up bumping into him at a pub. I was super drunk and embarrassingly confessed that I was really into him, which he was shocked to know about. He told me he was into me too but didn't think I liked him that way, and we ended up kissing and promising to meet again. He specifically mentioned that he'd come out of a complicated situation with someone months ago, but said that 'let's see how things go'. 

It's been three days since. He texted a day later to ask how my day was and we've sort of been texting since but he's an exceptionally dry texter. I'm also worried if I don't plan to meet up again, that he's never going to initiate it. How do I know if he actually likes me (enough to date me) or if I should just let it be.

"I've been with my BF for 4 months. He's crazy about me. He stays at mine 3 nights a week.  We just came back from a 3 day trip away and had a brilliant time. He's been saying he loves me for the last few weeks. I sort of knew before he even said it to be honest. He's met my family, I've met his twice and we've met each others friends. He remembers everything I say and do, he's always happy to see me, he treats me better than any of my exes have. He feels like someone I've known for a long time, even when we first met. He feels the same.

He married his ex summer 2021, after dating for 3 years. She cheated 6 months later, he forgave her and she did it again in late November. He ended it the night he realised she'd cheated a second time. He is flying to Canada to end it in a few months as he has to wait a year (they married there, he's Irish, as am I). Everyone in his life has been very welcoming, even their mutual friends who have since cut her off as they were so angry. He's been very upfront and will even show me when she messages. At this point, it's just her asking him to mail the last of her stuff etc. He added me on FB yesterday and I was stupid and looked at his profile...huge mistake. She had so many pictures of her hugging or kissing him and they look adorable. She's nothing like me. I know I'm an attractive woman but she's quirky and alternative- vegan yoga instructor stoner type, covered in tattoos, doesn't want kids (ironic as my BF eats meat, no tats, doesn't smoke, wants kids?). Caffeine and alcohol are the only ""drugs"" I consume, I want kids and work a corporate job and am too chicken to get tats or piercings. I feel so sad when I think of how he was some other woman's man and I'll never live up to her. I worry you can only love like that once. I wouldn't know as my longest relationship was 2.5 years and this is my second time feeling in love.How do I stop feeling insecure? I keep worrying that as soon as he flies to Canada to finalise the divorce he'll give her a third chance, no matter how committed he is to me. I've expressed this concern several times and he always reassure me he doesn't want someone who would cheat and the longer they are apart, the more he sees they wouldn't work out long term. 

TLDR: I keep worrying that my BF will leave me for his wife. They've been separated 9 months. How do I stop worrying?"	ThrowRA161773	post	32.69042915227436	female	White	0.0013241581618785858	na	na	na	4	relationships

I understand that she cheated, which lead to the break up but it was clearly his sign to find what he really wanted, which is you. i think you should find peace in the fact that are ticking boxes and that he hasn’t again settled for someone clearly not in line with what he wants	ThrowRA161773	reply	na	na	na	0.0013241581618785858	no	no	no	na	relationships
"My partner (24F) and I (25M) have arguments from time to time just like any relationship. I think it's important to be open and honest with your partner about everything, but I cannot stand it when she discusses our issues with others (she mostly does this with her mother). I feel like this causes more issues because it allows people to develop unfair opinions based on 1 side of a 2 sided story. I also think our issues shouldn't be anyone's business but our own. I want an adult relationship with 1 person, not that person and their mother.

The last thing I want to be is a controlling boyfriend, and have now had her mother accuse me of this, for the above reason. Should I be okay with my partner sharing our issues with others? Do I need to change the way I feel on this matter? Or am I being reasonable? I just want to do right by the love of my life, and maintain a healthy relationship.

"I call it ""poisoning the well."" She vents her spleen to the people around her, and even after things get better with the two of you, all they've heard is the bad. They didn't go through the resolution and make-up. And even if she assures them later that things are better, they don't really know that - especially if she keeps venting each time a new problem comes up.

Once the well is poisoned, there's no coming back. The poison is there to stay. And if her mother is accusing you of being abusive and controlling, there's no future where you have a happy long-term relationship that your families both approve of. At best she cuts her mom out of her social life entirely and the bad feelings fade with time... But almost certainly instead the poison gets entrenched and *you* get blamed for ""turning my daughter against me."" 

I'll be honest OP, the only ways I see situations like these resolved are by the venter doing a complete 180 and cutting (or minimizing) contact with the people they've poisoned against you...

At the same time, I can understand your partner wanting an outside perspective and guidance on an important matter in their lives from someone they know and trust.

There's no ""correct"" answer to this dilemma, but instead, I think you two need to find common ground that you can both be satisfied with. For instance, are there certain relationship topics you're okay with your partner sharing with someone they trust, but not others? Are there certain people who you don't trust, but your partner does? The only winning move here is whatever you can BOTH feel okay with.

Do you feel that your partner isn't an independent person who's capable of making their own decisions, and will just blindly accept whatever advice they're given without any critical thinking or assessment through her own lens?

- internalize my relationship disagreements and treat my partner poorly based on what's discussed 
- take my side regardless of the disagreement 
- don't have a history of healthy relationships themselves

You can want feel that it's not okay for your partner to share the disagreements with others, you can communicate that to your partner but the only way you can manage that happening is by setting a boundary for yourself since your partner isn't a child and therefore you have no control over them.

A boundary would mean communicating you're not okay with a partner sharing relationship disagreements with others and what consequence you intend to enforce should they do so. In many instances, the only practical consequence is choosing to not be in a relationship with someone who behaves that way 🤷🏾‍♀️.

Chances are, this is just one of many symptoms that will show up as a result of mom's poor boundaries and this kind of relationship between mom and your gf.

"I think this is a nuanced issue. It's normal and healthy to want advice and support from people you trust, and I think it's really unhealthy to turn your relationship into an issue that must be kept secret. That is something abusers tend to do, it makes it harder for their victims to realize the problems with the arguments they're having and the treatment they're experiencing. On the other hand, sometimes people will vent to their friends or family members in a way that is extremely one sided, and instead of actually offering good advice or emotional support the friends or family will just assure them they're 100% right and tear down and insult the other partner. 

So I don't think you should try to stop her talking to her mother. That is on fact controlling.

"**tl;dr: Guy I'm dating is great in many ways but has a lot of issues that would make a serious relationship hard. I would be fine with the casual arrangement we have now for quite a long time (since I am working on a lot of my issues too), but he has hinted a little at eventually wanting to take things further. I would if he worked on his issues, but he's not interested in doing that. Am I stringing him along by staying in the casual arrangement?**

I've been dating a guy for about 8 months. He has a lot of amazing qualities, and has taught me a lot about life, probably in part because of how much older he is. However, it is obvious that he is extremely emotionally immature and would be bad for a real relationship. I know it's not just me, because he has never been in a long-term relationship (never dated for over 6 months), by his own admission, always long term FWBs or ""casual dating.""

The current arrangement works for me. I have a lot of issues myself (I'm being treated for CPTSD) that would certainly come out if we were in a ""real"" relationship. We see each other once every 1-2 weeks on average but sometimes we'll go 3 weeks without seeing each other. This is by his design - I wanted things to be more serious at first but once I got to know him more, I knew that wouldn't work.

He's been hinting at wanting to move things further. He has introduced me to most of his friends, invites me to any group outings with his friends, and makes future plans with me (e.g. he bought tickets for us to something happening in February).

I have said multiple times that I want to work out my own life before getting into a serious relationship, which is true. He has had much more time to build his life than me due to his age. But he still hints at eventually moving in together. When I say that I don't want to, or that it would be many years (5+) before I would consider something like that, he just says things like ""Well, I'm patient, so we can go further whenever you're ready"" which (1) I don't believe is sincere, and (2) he has issues too, it's just that they're less obvious and the people in his life are okay with them.

But he isn't willing to work on his issues - he's a porn addict, he keeps constantly busy to avoid his feelings (!!!), he doesn't take care of himself at all (he looks 46 even though he's 36), and he is highly judgmental and critical underneath his ""nice"" personality. He had a bad childhood, and I think he is a ""codependent"" type rather than a genuinely nice person. He's anti-therapy even though he definitely needs it, which is a dealbreaker for a serious relationship for me - I think self-knowledge is very important. But this casual arrangement has taught me a lot, and I have improved my life a lot outside of therapy and have become more open, because I see that he has many similarities to me yet is accepted by so many people.

TBH I don't think he wants something long-term either, since he has never done it and is 36. From what I know of him, it seems like he wants the ego boost of having a partner and wanting someone to move in with him, but doesn't actually want it (Like, ""I wanna get married but not be married""). He often says things like ""I lived with my parents until I was 30, I want to live alone for a long time before having anyone else here,"" so why even mention it? I brought this up to him and he was just like ""Hmm... I'm not sure, I'd have to think about it.""

Do you think I am stringing him along? Again I am happy with how things are going for my own personal growth, and have made it clear that I don't want to be serious, at least for a very long time.

"I think you need to have an even more forthright and open conversation about where each of you sees your relationship heading (or *not* heading). So far you've been diplomatic by saying that you aren't interested in a long-term/deeper relationship because of your situation. And that's great that you've been clear about that. But now that he's pushing for more, you have to give him the follow-up information:  if you were looking for something more, it would not be with him as things stand now.

And that's going to be hard. His feelings are going to get hurt. But he deserves to know that you don't see a future with him and why. So have that hard conversation; lay down the obstacles as you see them, and then give him time to just think about it before you talk again. Does he agree with your assessment of the problems? Is he willing to commit to working on any of them?

If he's willing to make real changes, how much support can you offer him and in what form? If he is making a good-faith effort and achieves progress, would you reconsider a deeper commitment?

"For context this happens when I was 19. I was in shape back then, always kept my hair neat, well spoken, good grades etc. I saw this beautiful girl in my class and I asked her out and she said yes with a big smile. During the date I realized I didn’t like her at all I just found her cute and I wanted to leave mid date not gonna lie. 

Anyways, during the date we got some bubble tea first and she was so into me like she was always touching me which I liked. We sat and she was SOO NERVOUS. Not once in my life have I had a beautiful girl nervous to be on a date with me I’m usually the loser who doesn’t understand queues. I saw her hand shaking when she went to pull her hair behind her ear and I just ignored it. I started talking about my weaknesses and how I get nervous presenting in front of class etc. She literally said are you serious? I was like what… she told me I look like I have everything together. She meant I look like I am confident and I get things easily. I understand in hindsight how that may seem but I was very insecure but didn’t wanna highlight all my weaknesses in the same night. She seemed more chill after I became vulnerable around her and that was that.

Fast forward to 25 and I been through so much stuff I gained so much weight lost my way and pretty miserable. Now I’m getting myself back on track - hitting the gym 7 days a week, picking up old hobbies, keeping up with hygiene etc. But I can’t get any girls attention and I’m wondering if it’s because of what the girl had told me?

"I'm pretty sure something said to you six years ago, let alone from from a minor who was only 17 and doesn't know about the world, should have any weight today.

I would talk to your friends now. Tell them your issues with finding dates, and ask them what you can improve on. We only know what you've told us, so we can't help much.

A few things I notice though:

- that you are using something that happened six years ago is strange. Have you been out in the world since then, like traveling, going to events, living on your own or with roommates, getting a job, college, making friends, experiencing new hobbies, etc?

- that you say you don't need counseling. Everyone should go to therapy once in their life at least. It opens up so many doors and ways of thinking about ourselves we haven't considered. 

- it sounds like you grew up bullied and mentally abusive environment. That's a reason to get therapy, so they can help you heal. It doesn't mean anything is bad or wrong with you. It's so you can feel better about your life.

- you say you are awkward and stoic. That's not very attractive and will turn women away. I suspect that is coming from your self-esteem which is low. Your viewpoints about looks and attraction sound inaccurate and also looking down at yourself. You don't need to be white to be handsome.

"Like five months ago I (19F) met this man (36M) in college. We used to help each other with some homework, and then we started talking more and more. I really like him. We've been going out and I always have a great time with him, he makes me laugh a lot, he's respectful, and he's given me one of the best kisses I've ever had. But I don't want anything serious, told him that, and he's okay with it too. I just want to have a good time with him, and I do. A lot. But one friend of mine is angry with me because she says it is definitely wrong and I shouldn't be going out with him, because of the age. I, personally, don't see anything wrong with it, I know what I want, I have fun with him and I'm not hurting anyone doing this, but maybe I am wrong. Am I?

"At 19, 1000% yes it’s wrong. He’s a creep and we should shame him. 

If you were 36 and the guy was say 55, no one would bat an eye and it would be ok. Slightly big age gap but whatever. 

The reason for that is the starting point. It’s not a dig at you, but at 19 you and no one else has much of life experience, nor should you have any. At 36 you’d have gained a lot of life experience and would know what is what. This is true for everyone, even those who think they’re ‘mature for their age’. 

The only reason a 36yo would date a 19yo because he knows you don’t have much experience in dating, and wants to control you and influence you. Also, what exactly does he have common with you? I am 30, and I can tell you I have nothing in common with a 20yo college student- not friends, lifegoal, priorities, emotional needs and what they can offer.

"It's not inherently wrong, in my opinion, especially as neither of you are looking for anything serious. If you're happy with something casual, then good for you. But don't neglect friendships and relationships with people your own age.

That said, even at 28 I don't think I'd have much at all in common with a typical 19 year old, let alone be able to have any sort of intimate connection; the emotional/intellectual difference is just too large. So to imagine myself in another 8 years dating a person who was born after I started drinking? Not a good look.

There are outliers. He might be super immature, you might be super mature. If the former, that's not great relationship material, but if you're just casual, that could be okay?

Without knowing you or the guy, no one can say for sure, just that in the majority of cases, the much older man would simply be using the young woman for sex and validation, and be taking advantage of you and the pretty big power imbalance that comes with having much more life experience. He's in a position to essentially groom you, and if he's smart and immoral, he could get under your skin and you might not realise you're being manipulated. That's the danger. Not necessarily what's happening, but something to be aware of.

I don't want to sound patronizing, but teenagers are generally pretty naive, and more easily manipulated. It really is a case of needing life experience (and as-of-yet unformed neurological qualities) to recognize manipulative behaviour. So long as you're aware that he might just be using you, and you stay super aware for signs of manipulation, you can make the call yourself.

It's almost certainly not worth it; relationships are a great way to learn about yourself and the world, but you're playing with fire. I don't want to scare you, but I've read too many stories on here about people who got into relationships with controlling older men when they were too young to see how much damage was being done to their mental health and self-esteem. It's possible he's a perfect gentleman, but to be honest he should know better than to date a teenager.

"Hey guys,
Its my first time posting and looking for advice, except a few days ago in my mother language, so excuse grammar mistakes.

I try to keep it as short as i can.
Iam Male 21 and my Girlfriend, my first love, the love of my life left me on July 2. We literally had every first time you can have in a relationship togehter. I just ... i just dont know what to do she was literally my everything ... We were together 3 and a half years, when we met i was 17 and she 16 years old. The reasons for the breakup were things she told me about a lot of times and my dumbass just dont listened or just didnt get it ... i hate myself so much for not listening. The problems in short are: Communication issues (little things just like small talk or just talking much in general) or sometimes i can be very unfriendly and realise it when its to late. Also smoking weed was a problem beacause it makes me lazy and even more uncommunicative. 
Right now im hitting the gym (never did before), making a therapy (to solve the unfriendly part and communication issues) and stopped smoking again (i did stopped a while ago for almost a year) but then started again. Of course we talked when she told me it wont work and she is unhappy but we didtn really have ""that"" ending talk ... she also told me on that day we can talk 2 weeks later again but it didnt happened. I still have so much questions and things to say to her ... 
Also her family was kinda my 2. Family so i lost not only the love of my life but also my family. I dont have much friends because we had us the last years. 
I miss her so much and just dont know what to do ... all the things iam doing right now are helping, but in the end iam thinking about her the whole day and since the breakup i cried everyday the soul out of me ... 
I chatted a little bit with her mother and she said things like ""give her time"", ""its not like she cant love you, its because she was unhappy you didnt listened"" and ""for now she want no contact"". Those things also give me a little bit hope but i just dont know if i should fight for her or not ...

TL:DR: First love left me after 3,5 years, i think she still have feelings, fight or move on?"	ClassicOk6806	post	19.44640736586807	male	White	0.9964799284934998	na	na	na	6	relationships

"Hey OP, sorry you're going through this pain. I had a relationship about the same length end around the same time, and while I can tell you it DOES get better, it also will hurt for a long time and will definitely influence future relationships. So if someone tells you to just get over it, tell them to shove it. Take your time and work through it. 

That being said, it helps to put things in context after and avoid some common pitfalls that strike a lot people who get a bad breakup for the first time. When I broke up with my girlfriend around your age, oof, it threw me. But after some time and thinking I found out/learned/accepted a lot of things. Turns out my family never liked her as much as I thought, but put on a smiling face because I was so head-over-heels for her. She had a nasty, vindictive streak I never saw clearly until I was out of the relationship. I missed a lot of opportunities for friendships and activities because I spent my time with her. And (as I learned in later relationships), it turns out we weren't really that sexually compatible and later lovers put our ""best"" sex to shame.

Not saying all of those apply to you, but once the pain fades, I think you might want to reexamine the last few years and see if they're really as rose-tinted as you're imagining them. It already looks like you're on your way - realizing you didn't make friends because you spent your time with her instead. I think you'll find a lot more situations like that as time goes on. 

Keep going to the gym, getting to therapy, and improving yourself. But absolutely STOP bugging her and her family. That chapter is over and done with. It's rough, but the more of a complete separation you have between you and her (including her family), the easier it'll be to move on. And don't fall into the trap of thinking you're improving yourself to ""get her back."" Improve yourself for you, so the next girl you find - who is an even better match for you - is met with the best version of yourself.

"Sorry you're going through this and I'm sorry it's difficult. You should do your best to grieve the loss of this relationship over the next few months. Cry when you need to cry and don't run away from it. However, don't try to win her back, and don't assume she still has feelings.

First breakups are hard, and I can tell you're still viewing your relationship like it was a Hollywood movie. You did everything together, you integrated yourself into her family, and you think she was the only one for you. You didn't have ""that"" ending that you were hoping for, and that's because in real life ""that"" ending doesn't happen a lot of the time. You want closure but I want to tell you that you probably won't get it. 

Most importantly: movies portray relationships as doing everything together, but a critical part of what makes a relationship work is *having your own independent life:* having your own friends, hobbies, and interests. You've spent the last 4 years letting your relationship define who you are, but it's going to be important going forward for you to figure out your own identity *outside* of a relationship.

I want you to know this breakup is actually a gift. For the first time, you're going to be able to start figuring out who you are (through experience, therapy, etc). You can start to examine where your relationship went wrong so that you can become a better partner for your next GF. You have nobody's expectations to meet but your own, and now you can go out and meet new people (men and women) and make new friends and partners. For now, grieve properly, keep going to the gym and therapy, and go easy on yourself."	ClassicOk6806	reply	na	na	na	0.9964799284934998	strong	no	no	na	relationships

TL;DR: My wife asked me to sleep in his brother’s living room otherwise he’ll call his brother. She claims she gave my alternatives: I either sleep in the living room or leave the house with no money and no car. I think it is forcing, she thinks she gave me two alternative.

Hi folks. Let me explain the situation:

I have lost my wallet a couple of days ago and I am not able to renew my driver license because of immigration issues and I have to have my wife drive me around until we figure out a way. I don’t have any card, cash, or other types of liquid assets and my wife has been paying stuff from her card (I put my income to her account this week) I am the major provider in the family since she hasn’t been able to work for 3 months.

We have been staying on her Brother’s house and we had a small argument because she thought I was trying to look at a girl on a Facebook suggestion. She get super pissed off (some small bad stuff also happened, but no need to mention), and asked me to sleep in the living room otherwise he’ll call his brother.

I hate cold and she knows it, and she didn’t offered any blanket.

I hesitated to leave at first but then after she threatened me to call his brother, I asked him to send me money from Uber so I can go sleep in my place. She said no. I said OK, can I go to the car so I can charge my phone and sleep in there, she said no. I said at least can I get the phone charger, she even didn’t let me take it.

So I had to sleep in the extremely cold living room without no blankets. Then she called me back and gave me an apologize, I said we’ll talk tomorrow.

Today, she said she didn’t give me money (the money I earned mostly), because I was emotional and willing to spend unnecessary money.

She didn’t give me the charger because she thought I would order Uber.

She didn’t give me his car because she can’t give her personal stuff when I am out of mind.

And we just talked, I claimed she has done a horrible thing and she had no right to put me in such a situation with no alternatives. She thinks she gave me an alternative because “I can sleep in the living room, or I could just leave the house (with no car, no money, no driver license). And I claimed that this is forcing, not giving alternatives, since one option is I don’t want, the other option is a horrible option so I have to pick the lesser one.

What do you think about the issue? What should I do? I offered her to find a mediator to discuss the thing because she was extremely hesitant to try to understand my reasoning. However she also hang up the phone and refused to talk to a mediator."	Michael-scott123	post	27.23008210460956	male	White	0.9988380074501038	na	na	na	6	relationships

Obviously, we do want to be together and I could potentially find a job with her company or potentially with another company (though it will be difficult as we are in a very niche field and I’ll have a PhD) so we can live together. However, not everything is so ideal.

The problem stems from talking about the future and long-term plans together. There has been an ongoing issue in our relationship (and even before we started dating) in regard to her trying to maintain a level of independence versus making decisions as a team. This has caused conflict in everything from making small decisions in the kitchen, making plans with friends, planning trips, and longer-term plans like what we will do after I graduate. This issue even delayed us starting to date and us taking a week break at one point. She is very particular about things being done her way and does not take it well if I go against the plans she wants. This has resulted in me conceding often to her demands and bending over backward to my own detriment to make her happy. You definitely say she wears the pants in this relationship, and she knows it. If I tried to wear the pants, this relationship wouldn’t exist. To a large extent, I am okay with this with one big exception. I’m willing to move to her city to take a job so we can be together, but only if we make decisions as a team regarding our careers and where we live. She is not willing to agree to this and says I’m being unfair (she does this when I try to set boundaries, claiming I’m being controlling). In reality, I want to move back to the west coast to be closer to family and pursue academia as a career or do consulting ideally near my hometown. **Am I wrong in believing that we should have compromise in these career/life-changing decisions if we are going to stay together?** I know it's early in our relationship, but I need to start making decisions soon in regard to job applications. Clearly, if I were to move to her city, I would be doing so knowing that she may choose to leave by her choice or because she has to (she is on a temporary 3 year working visa) and I would have to accept that. But as graduation approaches, I’m finding myself more stressed and anxious about this. After talking to a therapist and reevaluating the situation, I don’t think moving to her city would be the best decision for me. The therapist also really made me realize how this topic of her wanting to be in charge and independent isn’t just going to go away and will continue to cause problems over time.

There have also been some recent hard conversations about marriage. Marriage is important to me in the long term, but she has been mostly opposed and very opposed to combining our lives together i.e. combined bank accounts, buying a house, etc. Once again, maintaining a sense of independence and not wanting to be in a position where she can be controlled. Also, she has expressed that she has really questioned if I’m the right person for her as she is religious and I am not. This was not an issue when we first started dating, but after a traumatic medical event and surgery, she has since become closer to her beliefs. Recently she has debated if this is a dealbreaker.

We did talk about these issues yesterday, and I would say it didn’t go well. I think she underestimated how anxious this was making me (though I’ve repeatedly brought this topic up). She asked me if I would’ve applied for jobs there if she wasn’t living there and I said no, the Pikachu surprised look on her face was a little funny but struck me as a little dense. We talked about the issue of her tendency to want to make decisions, being independent, etc. which she agreed with but was unwilling to concede any change or compromise. All else that was asked is if I would be willing to do a long-distance relationship if I move elsewhere, which I said I don’t know (really, I’m not).

"Why would you continue dating someone who doesn't share your views on marriage, doesn't want to live where you do, doesn't share your religious views, doesn't want you as an equal partner and is unwilling to compromise but more than willing to dump you if you don't give in to her every demand.

I don't even know this woman and I'm already exhausted by her attitude. The longer you waste dating her, the longer you draw out a relationship that was always going to end as soon as you say ""No"" for the first time."	dangerous_dude	reply	na	na	na	0.9979111552238464	no	no	strong	na	relationships
She seems to want to live her life in a certain way and by that I mean she wants to be able to leave everything behind if the notion hits her. Her reluctance to share a bank account or buy a house together tells me that she’s not invested enough in the relationship or certainly she’s not as invested as you are. You said that you had a week’s break a while ago well I would recommend a break of a couple of months and then you can decide whether you really want to stay in the relationship.	dangerous_dude	reply	na	na	na	0.9979111552238464	no	strong	no	na	relationships
"> In reality, I want to move back to the west coast to be closer to family and pursue academia as a career or do consulting ideally near my hometown. […] I need to start making decisions soon in regard to job applications.

As someone also set to get my PhD in May 2024 (unless I succeed in securing another year of funding), I know the anxiety of staring down the barrel of the academic job market. You have a girlfriend (I almost wrote partner, but clearly, she’s not really your “partner” in life, is she?) who makes decisions that are best for her, without regard to your desires or what’s best for your shared relationship. If nothing else, I think it’s clear that you need to do the same at this stage. 

The known wisdom for (🤞) getting a career in academia is to be open and flexible: Apply broadly on the job market, to post docs, TTs, VAPs/short-term contracts, in any and every geographic location with an available position. So, pursue all leads, and then see where you are in your relationship. If you get a TT offer in your hometown, I think it’s clear that moving to industry in your girlfriend’s (temporary!) city is out of the question. If your only offer happens to be in her city, then you can decide if you want to take it or move back to your hometown while preparing for another round on the market next cycle. Right now you’re in the land of hypotheticals, and you need to just move ahead applying in ways aligned with your best interest, and then you can make a decision based on concrete options.

Job market next steps aside, you may want to treat this application period as an off-ramp to emotionally disengage from this relationship. It doesn’t seem to be offering what you want out of life and a romantic partnership. You’re absolutely not wrong in believing that a partnership (especially one leading to marriage) ought to entail mutual compromise and consideration of each other’s wants and needs. Clearly, your girlfriend isn’t in a place where she’s ready for that kind of partnership, or perhaps she doesn’t ever want it, maybe with you or maybe in general. From what you wrote, it sounds like she’s missing her cultural roots, unwilling to tie herself indefinitely to this country, and pretty likely to, like you, return to her own family in the foreseeable future. Speculation aside, you seem incompatible for the next chapter of your lives. She’s prioritizing what’s best for her, and you should do the same.

To share my experience by way of comparison, I am considering jumping to industry and staying in an area I don’t like / foregoing a move to where I really want to be, for the sake of my 3-year relationship. But in my case, my fiancé is considering the same: being flexible with his career and moving to a place he’s unfamiliar with and far from family/friends. We both know that finishing my PhD and embarking on my career is going to be a major shift and we have to be flexible for it. What we ultimately do depends on what offers I get and what jobs he can find there. We are very much a team, and this period would be 10000x more stressful if I didn’t feel I could trust him to prioritize my interests just as readily as I do his.

To answer your question, I've definitely put up with this because she is stunning, charismatic, fun, and can be very sweet/caring. I was definitely lovestruck at first sight, which definitely left a veil over my ability to see these problems. It was easier at the beginning to naively think things would change. But as time has gone on and because of the long distance, it's given me a lot more time to think and reevaluate. I want to spend the rest of my life with her because I do really love her, but we obviously don't want the same thing. This might not have caused a conflict so soon in our relationship if we already were living and working in the same place, but I guess it's better for this to happen now.

"Oh you and I can definitely relate with the upcoming stress related to the final year of a PhD and the academic job market!! My market is even tighter as there are only 15 programs across the country (mining engineering) so I may be forced to apply abroad or try my luck with my background in a different department (likely). There is a university with an engineering program near her, but it does not have a mining department.

I agree with your assessment of the situation in regard to our incompatibilities. Really I'm on here to validate that I'm not crazy or being controlling for wanting a true partnership. If she is just going to look out for herself, I feel it's best that I do the same for myself. It has been really hard coming to terms with this, but as you said starting job application process is probably the most fitting way to start disengaging.

I'm glad to hear you have a supportive partner and that you two have been able to make plans together as a team. I don't have that in this relationship and I don't think I ever will.

"Have I brought it on myself?

So… myself and my Mrs have been talking about experimenting with another person during sex, she wanted a guy and this maybe weird to a lot of you but I said yes. 

She was going on a night out so we brought up in conversation for her to bring someone home, she had been on a few nights out previously and this lad was with her amongst her other friends, he had picked her up the week before for a night out too. (Let’s call this lad Tom)

She goes on this night out, I pick her up at 5am from night out, she’s alone and we get home and we go sleep and the next 7 days are normal, back to work and all that jazz. 

Over the following weekend she tells me that her and this lad(Tom) kissed the weekend prior outside the club they were at.

I’m obviously feeling a certain way, rather deflated and empty. She’s like “well it’s only a drunken kiss, you was happy for him to come back” 

At first I kinda joked and humoured it but that was just a defence mechanism, now I can’t look at her without visioning them kissing. 

Have I brought this on myself? I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place.

"I have been with my partner for 2.5 years and we live together. Through the job I am currently in, I have to complete 8 exams. I completed 1 last winter, 1 in the spring and now I have 2 in the winter this year.  


  
Last yead for the exam I told my gf I'll have to study on weekends since a lot of work is involved. I said we'd still be able to do things in the evenings but I wouldn't be free for days out. She was slightly annoyed but accepted it. Last night she started talking about weekends away and days out we can do in the autumn and winter this year. I told her that I wouldn't be able to go on any again this year but that once my exams were finished we can have a weekend away.  


  
She got annoyed and said I should give myself some weekends off but I just told her I don't want to risk not giving myself enough time to study and then panicking near the time of my exams. She said I wasn't thinking about the relationship and that I should be willing to have 1 or 2 weekends off. I told her that I am not risking it and that it's only 2.5 months and that we can do things afterwards.  


  
She said I was refusing to compromise and that I need to consider what she wants and that I should at least plan a weekend away with her. I told her no and that she can still do days out or a weekend away with friends but she just said I was being unreasonable. Does anyone have any advice on how they would handle this?  


  
tl;dr I have exams I need to complete so I plan to spend my weekends revising in the months after my classes start.

I’d suggest talking to your partner about why this program is so important to you and that you’d really appreciate her support when you’re studying. I know how hard it is to set boundaries, especially for those you love, but this is exactly how it should be done.

We have only seen each other once in 3 months because she got in trouble with her parents for about 2 months, then she started making excuses for why we couldn’t see each other, and I now realize how stupid I was to not see what was going on. All I can think about now is her doing this to me after us dating for almost two years. It just really hurts to see someone you love stab you in the back like that. All I can do is think about what she did to me and it makes me feel anxious and terrible. Obviously, we are not together anymore. I know I’ll get over it eventually, but I hate feeling like this. Could any of you help me and give me some ideas on how to cope with this for the time being?

"So I [21M] recently met with someone [23F] and have been hanging with them for about a week now. She's pretty nice and I enjoy being around her, but I between me still being in university w/ her not and learning that she has several health issues (including and especially PCOS), that makes me feel kind of unsure about further pursuing a relationship. Again, she is absolutely amazing as a person, but I feel like if I'm already having hesitancy about it, then that may not be a good sign for later. I especially don't want to hurt her feelings, since she does seem interested in me and I would like to at least keep a friendship, but I also don't want to waste her time. Idk, what's y'all's thoughts? Am I being being a jerk having these concerns considering none of these are in her control, or is my worries valid?

He got angry because i used a few tissues too many, only shops reduced stickers and splits the bill with friends to the penny.

He has money and grew up abroad with money. Why would he behave like this if he has always had money?

"I am just really confused and need some advice. I (39F) have been sleeping with my friend (45M) for 10 months. We have known/slept with each other off/on for 13yrs. 

The sex is plentiful and exciting. We see each other every weekend and do a lot of other activities together like hiking, sporting events, theme parks, hanging out with our friends and just watching TV/gaming. His actions are totally in line with caring about me: he takes time off work to spend special days with me, takes care of me when I have panic attacks and when my close friend passed away, he got me perfect birthday presents and has recently been very affectionate. 

We don't talk about ""us"" and have never said ILY since starting sleeping together again (we'd say it before when we were ""just friends"" such as when hugging goodbye.) But when I asked what we are/what he wanted with me, he said he didn't know. In the past, someone telling me they don't know is an invite for me to leave because I deserve, and desire, passion and commitment. But he made it seem like he is going through something, that is making life hard for him, unrelated to us (but wouldn't open up further.) He said he doesn't want to be with anyone else and would tell me if that ever changed. 

I don't want to throw in the towel, I really care about him and I can't expect everything to be perfect/easy, but I don't want to be an idiot and stay too long with someone who doesn't want a future with me. I have all this love to give and sex to have and am building a beautiful life for myself and the person that cares to join me. I love him and I'm terrified of being hurt again but at my age I'm more hopeful about the possible love and safety in store for us, if things work out. 

I just don't know if I should stick it out, support him in any way he'll let me, and hope it makes us stronger/closer; or just cut my losses and find someone more enthusiastic about being with me.

" im 20 years old now and where i live we have 1-12th grade and then university. 11-12th grade is college. im in 12th grade now. my brother(23) moved out after 10th grade. i was in grade 8 then and id tell mom(42) that i wanna go to the capital for college too. she'd get really mad at me then so i stopped saying it. its not like i have been her favorite child or anything. she loves my brother more, on the other hand i grew up in neglect. i was treated very badly and it was only after i made visible s.icide attempts that they have started to take care of me. i have final exams for college starting in a few days.

mom and i had a rather strained relationship for 18 years. we're fine now but i feel that she sees me as an extension of herself. she says she wants me to go to the capital but as the time is approaching for it, i find that she is instigating quarrels with me and saying that shes not gonna let me go. i have been diagnosed with bpd, i have abandonement issues so when i start to feel bad i shut myself down instead of lashing out. this exam stress has been killing me too and she has been taking this personally. she says it means im not gonna take care of her onay day,that shes all alone etc. she did this last night too and i said she makes things all about herself. she went quiet.

my mom and dad have been doing this for years.i told my parents i was being bullied at my dad's school and wanted to change schools and they said no. after a lot of convincing they said okay, try it at X school. but i couldnt find a birth certificate so my dad said that he will get a copy and finish procedures. my friends with much lower grades than me got in but i didnt. so i asked dad and he admitted that he never turned my application in. after that i wanted to at least apply to colleges in the capital but they didnt allow me to. they said i wasnt mature enough.

are they unable to let me go and are trying to pin the fault on me? at this point im not sure what they even want from me. this psychological rollercoaster is ruining my confidence

"I (24, F) kinda know what the advice will be but I need to get this off my chest anyway and hear opinions that are unbiased.

So basically my bf (24, M)  and I have been together for about 5 years and most things are good. He is so good to me. We have our rough patches for sure but overall I am so happy. We get along so well and tbh idk what i would do without him at this point and the thought of moving on after so long is frightening. 

The issue is our futures. The biggest issue is that he wants kids and I don’t. Like I truly to my bones know I don’t want kids under any circumstances. I have no motherly instinct, I have never even had the thought of having or wanting kids cross my mind. He has a nephew that comes to his house a lot and quite frankly it saddens me because I see how much fun he has interacting with his nephew and how good of a dad he would be. I feel bad a lot too because I feel like I’m depriving of him of his ideal future. 
 
My bf has said multiple times he chooses me over a future kid, but I find 2 things wrong with that. 
1. He would be miserable without a kid and probably end up resenting me
2. i think maybe he thinks i’ll change my mind and i don’t see that happening. 

Part of me thinks we should just go our separate ways, but I’m stuck bc I would hate to break up with such a good guy over one issue, but in the same token it’s a big issue. 

There’s a few other things like I am on track to get a breast reduction (doing physical therapy for insurance to cover it) and I haven’t even told him bc he is avidly against me doing it (for many reasons not just shallow ones.) Also I want tattoos and he doesn’t find them attractive on women and that has been a point of contingency as well. 

Anyway idk what to do. This sucks so bad i’m just in this weird state. I have talked to him about this too and he just says he doesn’t want to break up or that he’s not going anywhere etc. I don’t want to break up either but what if it’s what’s best for both of us?

Just hearing some thoughts and opinions, I would be grateful. If you could suggest options or what to do that would be great.

"For a relationship to work and be healthy in the long term (the Beatles song notwithstanding) love is *not* enough.  

Before love even enters into the picture, for a couple to be workable and have a future, the *first* think they must have is *Compatibility*.

Compatibility means that, for us to be in a relationship, I *must* be able to have *all* of the things I need in order to have a fulfilling life, while (at the same time) *not preventing you from having everything you need as well*.

That's not to say that it's your responsibility to *give* me everything I need, or that it's my responsibility to give you everything *you* need...but it *does* mean that none of my needs and your needs can be mutually exclusive.  If I *need* to live in the countryside, and you *need* to live in the big city, there is no compromise; no matter where we live, at least *one* of us isn't going to have what we need.

""Kids"" is one of the biggest, *hugest* needs about which there can be no compromise.

You cannot *not* have kids, while at the same time he *does* have kids, if the two of you are to remain together.

And when two people who have conflicting, mutually-exclusive needs *try* to have a relationship anyway (usually because ""but we love each other sooooo much, and we believe that love can overcome anything""), what inevitably happens is that at *least* one of the two *cannot* have his/her needs met.

That person begins a long miserable road that starts in frustration (""I'm not getting what I need""), takes an eventual detour through resentment (""I'm not getting what I need, and I'm angry at you because you're the reason why""), and then, ultimately, strands him/her in bitterness (""I haven't had what I needed for *years*, and now it's too late, and I'm miserable, because I sat by and gave you everything *you* needed, while I got nothing, and now I hate you for it"").

That's not a road you want to go down.

If kids are a no-go for you, and he needs to have them in order for his life to have the meaning he needs it to have...

...then the two of you have a fundamental incompatibility, and there is *no* healthy, workable, long-term path forward for the two of you.

My partner has an 18yo daughter and 13yo son from a previous marriage. His son lives with us. I have wanted 2 maybe 3 kids and when we started dating I confirmed he wanted more he agreed and was very sure. Now 18 months in I had doubts about this so I outrightly asked and said I need an honest answer or I’m leaving. He comes back with I don’t understand as I have not had kids and he’s never been able to be selfish with his income or travel like I have. He sits on it for a few days and has come back and said no I don’t want anymore but would consider having one more. In these few days he starts a new job and my grandpa goes into palliative care. He doesn’t want us to break up over a child. 

I’ve never loved anyone like this, and to make things more difficult his son and I have also become very attached, he sees me as part of his family. 

How do I go about this, do I take space and think about compromising and only having one or do I walk away and try to find someone else because I always wanted 2.

"How to tell a friend I’d like to put a pause on our friendship?

I(22F) have a friend(22M) from high school whom I reconnected with early last year (nothing bad happened we just kind of fell off and did our own thing for a few years). We clicked instantly and all summer we were basically attached at the hip. Then the fall semester started and they became a lot less available, which was something I initially struggled with a lot, but grew to accept after some open conversation. Then, they got extremely busy during the Spring semester, which, again, is fine EXCEPT that when we did try to make plans to hang out, they almost always cancelled on me extremely last minute because they procrastinated on their homework. 

This started to really hurt me, and it especially hurt me when they were joking about how they cancelled plans on a mutual friend we have, then asked me to hang out with them the day they were supposed to hang out with said mutual friend, and then last minute cancelled on me, too. I’ve been trying to act like I’m okay with it, and I really want to be because they truly have been a good friend and I always enjoy hearing from them/hanging out with them, but it’s starting to feel like we only ever talk/hang out on their terms but when I reach out I’m just ghosted for days on end. 

We still hung out a few times over the summer, and it was great and fun, but the behavior of them being hard to reach still persisted and I’m starting to feel like maybe it’s just not worth the time anymore. 

They’ve admitted to me that they’re a people pleaser, which I think is why they’re always such a ‘yes’ person when I suggest plans but later end up cancelling. They also have ADHD so I don’t think they really intend to go MIA all the time or even double book themselves, but it hurts me a little knowing that they very easily make plans with other people consistently but for some reason when it comes to me it’s so hard to reach them. 

I thought it might be the case that they were simply trying to distance themselves from me, but when I repeated their behavior back to them, they expressed that they knew I was mad at them. In general, we’ve had a few talks where I express how I feel about them and our relationship, and they always apologize and tell me they’ll do better. 

I know they are a good friend and if things worked better I’d be happy to continue, but I desire more consistency and they just can’t give that to me. I think it’s just a matter of conflicting personalities. 

I understand that surface level friends don’t text and call and hang out all the time, which is fine because I definitely have some surface level friends and I’m not at all bothered by them. Maybe I’m just mourning the connection we used to have, and I’m struggling to transition into a more surface level friendship, but it’s kind of hard to do that when every time we have hung out they always make it a point to be super affectionate and say they love me or say that they can’t just hang out with anyone else the way we do. 

I want to ask them to put a pause on our friendship so that I can heal and not allow this resentment to keep growing, and that maybe in a few months or however long I need and if we’re both open to reconnecting we can try again on a kind of clean slate. 

I struggle with knowing when it’s appropriate to set boundaries and trusting if my anxiety is reasonable or if it’s just anxiety, but I want to trust my feelings this time because it’s persisted for almost 6 or 7 months at this point, and I don’t like dwelling on it so much. Even now, I can’t tell if I’m being reasonable or not. Maybe to them, I’m just the anxious clingy friend, or something. I’ve tried really hard to just sit back and “go with the flow” with them (ex. accepting that they’re hard to reach when I reach out to them, but never when they reach out to me). I love them dearly and I don’t want to paint them as this terrible person, but I just need some space from them to work through this.

How would you guys go about something like this? 

TL;DR : Friend only seems to be available when they reach out to me, but never when I reach out to them, and it’s starting to build resentment."	blueberriebun	post	28.25892658244653	female	White	0.9991456270217896	na	na	na	1	relationships
I don't think you need say anything and are over thinking this, just trying to reach out less and taking it as it is will solve the issue. I can see how it would be frustrating for you but I've been in situations where I was like your friend and honestly it can be equally frustrating being very busy, especially with ADHD, while friends take it personally. Seeing a friend a few times a summer when you're busy sounds like trying to me and you're at an age where people's priorities start to really change and they have less free time in general.	blueberriebun	reply	na	na	na	0.9991456270217896	weak	strong	no	na	relationships
"I (21F) started seeing my bf (23M) 8 months ago and officially started dating 6 months ago. 

Last week i told him I love him and he also said i love you to me. I love spending time with him and the way he annoys me playfully. I would love to have him around all the time. He doesn’t need an invite to stay in my place overnight for as many days as he wants. He can literally tell me he is coming over and no matter how many things I have due for my assignments, i don’t have any issue with him coming. I love his presence even if we are not speaking. 

Yesterday he mentioned if i get a job in the state we both live in then would i be okay with moving in. He hesitated to ask me initially. I was like yeah i would be down if i get a good job offer here. I also thought about this the day i told him i love him and fell asleep. 

Side note: i will finish my grad school program next year. He already finished his grad school program. 

Tl;dr: he wants to move in with me at some point. I also want it too. Is this normal to feel this way after dating 6 months long or do u have to spend more time dating before considering moving in."

"I think it's totally normal to want to move in with someone after 6 months, but I think it's a bad idea.

When you live with someone, you give yourself a really big financial and practical incentive to continue the relationship. But some relationships shouldn't be continued. When you're only 6 months in it can be really difficult to know whether or not this is something that will last. Most relationships don't.

 I know that the idea of committing to this relationship may seem really romantic or attractive right now, but committing to the wrong person is one of the worst mistakes you can make. It's not something you can rush.  If you have to break a lease to end a relationship that can get really really expensive. You're also on the hook for the entire cost of rent, not just your half.

You also want to figure out what their bad habits are before you move in. You want to be able to ask yourself if you're okay with living with that person, assuming that they don't change any of those habits, because they probably won't."

"I think that unfortunately you kind of have to view moving with someone as "" do I know this person well enough to take on 10k+ of debt with them."" That's what a lease is - it's a contract that holds both of you liable for the entire cost of rent for the duration of the lease. Your relationship with your partner determines whether or not you can actually live in that home with them, not your debt to the landlord. You're on the hook for the lease unless you can find some way out of it, which usually involves forfeiting at least two months rent.

I'm bringing this up because I had to move out in the middle of a lease and it was extraordinarily expensive. If I didn't have savings and family to stay with I would have been in really deep financial trouble. I know a lot of people who've expressed that they want to move out but don't have the funds, which is a terrible situation."

"Yeah... I think that overall it was a good lesson & worth the financial loss. I would say just take the time to get to know each other well, and make sure you have the means to move out if you need to. You should always have a way out, even if you are married. 

I think the attitude that you might as well just move in early and see what happens is misguided. If you understand someone's flaws, you know what to expect from living together, and you have experience resolving conflicts and being around each other and stressful times it's going to go a lot smoother. I'm definitely not trying to say that you should never move in with anyone, just that it's not something to rush into and it's important to think about the risks, not just how excited you are.

"Me (25F) and my partner (25M) are completing 3 years together this month

We haven't had any fights in about 2 months, rn we are going through one of the worst fights, ever.  
Wednesday night, It was a long day, I had to leave work to rush to the ER, because my sister was severely hurt causing her a temporary memory loss, it was horrifying. He was supporting all along.  


Later that evening, we had dinner together and I sensed the heavy air around. After dinner we cuddled a little and I went home. I sent a silly text to lighten up the air and it was OK, he calls me about 2 mins later lashing out at me, not even knowing why he's angry, neither did I. 

  
He told me I was being annoying and he was suffocated by me. I apologized twice because I genuinely didn't know I was being a pain in the ass and I started bawling, he got angrier and started yelling and screaming at me to shut up and stop crying, he called me a donkey and some other names then he explained why he was so angry at me and I was causing him stress constantly and he went at me for about 30 mins, at this point I was sobbing, exhausted, hurt and very confused. 

  
He immediately apologizes after he exploded with anger and I went silent and in tears for a moment, he asked if I wanted to apologize, I did but I told him I didn't accept his apology, and just before I say anything else, Oh boy... That started another eruption of anger and name calling. I was called a mean, bad, unforgiving, unappreciative, selfish b\*\*\*h for not seeing that he is becoming a better person for me apologizing when he should and as fast as he could, which is absolutely true, and I've been as supportive as I can be all along, but I really wasn't in the head or heart space for that kind of out-of-nowhere anger, it was a painfully long day. He called me an asshole for not accepting the apology, and that I caused a stain in the relationship and a damage that we might not even get through with.

  
Things only got worse after this event, he was so hurt and angry, I was so hurt and angry, I reacted so horribly after the event, I had so much spite in me like never before, I was still in shock and unable to process that the highlight of the bad day wasn't my baby sister being sent to the ER with blood all over her face, but my partner's explosion at me for not accepting his apology! 

  
It is the 5th day, and he is still blaming me for all the pain and suffering, saying I should have just taken the apology and moved on, or at least keeping the comment to myself and apologizing back and moving on. I really really wish it were that simple, because I always do forgive and move on quickly. and I hate fights or staying and prolonging fights. But it really wasn't.

  
He's being hot and cold now, talking it out then blaming, then completely not talking to me then suddenly calling.. etc.

  
I really feel like I did injustice towards him and our relationship, and maybe he is right, I should have taken the apology instead of starting a fight that is a week long. I feel very selfish but I really didn't know any better. I'm traumatized by 2 things now, my sister's accident and the fight with my partner.

He has been much worse, going at me for days, doing much worse things at the slightest inconvenience, I was NOT allowed to show any single emotion of displeasure. 

The past year or so has been nothing but him working towards getting better, and I’m not sugarcoating anything but he did change, a lot, in many ways, he is almost like someone new and we all know change isn’t always a straight path. 

He does relapse at times but he manages to get up again and tries. I support him. 

But I am still confused by this event, not at the fact he exploded with anger, but at the fact he became 10x worse that I didn’t accept his apology. He was a person who’d never ever apologize for anything and even if he did, he had to see his own damage. That has changed a lot the past 6 months.

"I (33f) think my husband  (36m) is gaslighting me. I hate to use that term because it's thrown around like candy from a pinata recently, I really try not to use it lightly but help me figure out if that's really what is happening here.  
I feel like if you have to start off ""hey can you help me figure out if X is happening"" that alone is a gaslighting red flag. But I digress...  
  
My husband and I have a totally functional marriage in every single possible facet except for chores which has been a problem since like the minute we moved in together and has never let up, not once, for a decade+ now. For some added color, we're both only children - he grew up in an abusive authoritarian household and I grew up in an overly permitting avoidant household. Great combo I know.   
  
We have a lot of pets and a smaller place so it's already had to keep on top of, but there are other issues going on as well.  
  
1. Space and how we're using it - We have a three bedroom apartment. One bedroom we use for our bed. One bedroom we use for my office (his office is in the living room by the window). The other bedroom has become a sort of disgusting catch-all for things that really should be in the basement or in storage. I think we could really use this third room to help us out with our space/stuff issues as it's a literal THIRD ROOM we are not using correctly and right now it's just being used to store like... lawn mower stuff, paint, saws, like literal basement stuff. We have a basement, but it sometimes gets wet down there and he doesn't want to put that stuff down there. He could get a shelf but he doesn't. It's not a priority. Okay.  
  
2. Time/Energy - Our jobs have entirely different demands. I am the bread winner, I make almost twice what he makes. I have to go into the office 2x a week and he doesn't. Half the time when I see him working he's on TikTok or YouTube fucking off (which is FINE for the record I do this too when it's dead) but he acts like I have the easy job and he has the hard one - every time this comes up, when it's convenient for him, he has the stressful job. When we're not arguing about what has to be done around the house he has all the time in the world to do whatever the fuck he wants. I see this and I think the same about myself but apparently it's not true because when he's upset about how dirty the house is, I hear about how I sit around at my job and don't have much to do and he's the one busting his ass. Which is it? Is it both? Neither? On top of this, our sleep schedules differ a little. He's a natural early riser and I tend to fall asleep after him so I tend to be the closer, he's the opener. That is not necessarily taken to mean that when I go to bed the house is spotless, and when he wakes up, he cleans up what I missed. That's what should be happening in theory but it's not what's happening in practice. In reality we're both middle aged fully grown exhausted adults that have the energy to do what we have the energy to do. However, when he GETS the energy to clean at a time when I don't have it, that's when I have to hear about it ENDLESSLY. I'm talking - he'll come into the room every 5 minutes to rant about what he's doing and how I'm not doing it. If I don't give him anything there, he'll text me the same rant. Then when he's done, he's sorry about it, says he shouldn't have acted that way, we make up, and it happens again over and over.  
  
This is not to say that I do nothing around the house. This is the crux of my argument - he believes he does MORE, I believe we do the SAME, and I'm worried that the score keeping is causing lasting damage on our relationship that he doesn't really see.   
  
Example: Saturday morning he didn't sleep very well so after our run he decided he wanted to take a nap. While he napped, I meal prepped, cleaned the kitchen, and swept the floors. He wakes up, I go ""hey I meal prepped, cleaned, etc."" and he goes ""thank you!"" - gives me a big kiss. Today however he wakes up after me and is encountered with the same kind of mess and makes a huge deal, interrupts my sleep, yells at me, slams doors, etc. - it's like it erases every level of effort I put in when he does that and he doesn't seem to understand what it's doing to me even though I've told him 150,000 times that I don't know how to express that I do chores, I clean, I take care of as much as I can, and hearing that I don't is making me feel like I'm not even fully like... in my body and conscious when I'm doing these things. It makes me wonder if I really AM a slob, if I really do rely on him to clean up when in reality we're the ONLY TWO PEOPLE THAT LIVE HERE AND HE HAS AS MUCH POWER TO CLEAN AS I DO.  
  
What should I do????  
  
  
TL;DR - According to my husband when the house is messy it's my fault and when the house is clean it's only because he said something and I don't think it's true. "	canwepleasejustnot	post	32.230007534392655	female	White	0.9972200393676758	na	na	na	17	relationships

"Terrible. He admits that this behavior stems with how he was treated as a kid. Great that he realizes it... next step is reversing the behavior which is proving more difficult.

His mom and dad were not together when he was born, they were friends with benefits. His mom was addicted to cocaine and kidnapped him and took him across the country. His dad got custody and got him back as an infant but couldn't really care for him properly. Remarried someone when my husband was 7 or so, the step mom and him didn't get along at all. Think like - step parent comes in, pushes new kid aside, tries to make new family. Dad too spineless to stand up for his kid or include him. They moved him to basically an open-air drug/war zone in the city of Chicago in the early 90s because they wanted to invest in property there, which was ultimately a great decision because 15 years later they're loaded, but it didn't change the fact that they moved my husband from ages 8-18 to somewhere where he literally couldn't leave the house without getting mugged every day. On top of that he wasn't allowed to have friends over and was grounded for long stretches of time, but then when he was about 12 or 13 they would leave him alone for months at a time to go to Greece where they have second jobs and he would be left to fend for himself. He's kind of feral.

They kicked him out of the house when was 14 years old and had to be brought back to the home by CPS. 

They eventually shipped him out to one of those alternative troubled kids schools in Utah.

"Sorry this is long but rlly need advice lol :(   


  
I started seeing this guy last year around April, we immediately hit it off and started talking almost 8 hours a day (a little crazy I know,) we were definitely highly attached and everything started to move ridiculously fast. Around our third week I had hooked up with a previous friend of mine while I was immensely drunk. I regretted it immediately but decided not to tell him as we weren’t exclusive. He found out from a mutual friend and asked me about it but I was in such a state of shock that I lied to him. He let it go and it came up a few weeks later and we were more serious then so I told him the truth.   
He decided to break things off because of how hurt he was which was understandable. I apologized and came back to apologize months later after I processed everything. I wasn’t expecting anything out of this relationship and wanted to give it space and time and was accepting my reality.   


  
Weeks later he started to send me memes to which I would kindly reply but not try to force the conversation. I think he just missed our conversation but I figured he needed his space and time. But then it started to become consistent texting, he would tell me how much he missed me and how I was ‘the girl of his dreams.’ I would take these with a pinch of salt and let him vent out his feelings to me. Then came the late night calls and the tears, but all it was was venting? He would pretend he said nothing the next day.   


  
Soon after he wanted to see me, I was expecting us to start slow and be friends but immediately the first day he was flirting with me, asking me if I was dating, telling me how much he missed me. Then we slept together and he wanted to start seeing me everyday?? He asked me if we wanted to ‘to this’ and I said let’s take things slow. After which he completely switched. The dynamics reversed and it felt like I was chasing him, I got so upset one day I sat him down and was like??? What’s going on. He said we were just friends and I shouldn’t expect much of him. From which I pulled away and said I don’t want to be friends and said I needed space.  


  
It had been 8 months since then, during which he had been bread crumbing me through social media, which I had to remove him off of to move on. 2 weeks ago I found him on hinge and replied to one of his prompts, I was at a point where I was ok with being on friendly terms. He asked me for drinks and I agreed. We met up and our chemistry was the same, it started off platonic and then he was being immensely flirty and started to tell me how much he missed me again. Then he went in for multiple kisses which I swerved because it didn’t feel like the right time. I was still respectful. Afterwards however I like an idiot went over to hang out with him longer and one thing led to the other and we slept together.   


  
Afterwards I made it clear to myself that I wasn’t going to text him, he texted me but immensely unserious, playing everything cool and like nothing happened. I gave myself a week to process my emotions and then called him to talk about what happened. He said ‘we can just be chill and be friends,’ I figured his version of a friendship was very different, I wanted to hang out with him more and I was open to the idea of more. To which he said he couldn’t ever do with me because he can’t ever trust me. This actually blew my mind because then why lead me on for so long??? I’m a human too?? I have emotions too?? I am just annoyed because I wasted so much time and it is just so unfair on me.  


  
I feel so lied to and so used. I feel like a fool.  


  
If anyone has thoughts on this I would rlly appreciate, my head is In the biggest scramble.

My boyfriend (30 M) is very sweet and cares alot about me (19F). We never fight, and when we disagree we discuss it in a healthy way. He's perfect.

But there is one thing I can't let go of. I'm so jelous that he got to be wild and young before I met him. He was pretty crazy before I met him and I love that. I'm just jelous that I never got that.

I hate that he got to be a person with so much experience before I met him, and I barely got any. I haven't done anything wild or fun, esp because I spent most of my highschool career locked up indoors because of covid.

I hate when he shares some wild story and I can't contribute anything to it because I'm just some dumb inexperienced little girl. As much as I love hearing about it.
And I know you're probably thinking ""oh create new memories with him!"" That's not the point at ALL. I hate that I don't have any experience as my own person before him.

Real adults are okay with talking about things. If he cares about you, he'll know that he might be robbing you of your own experiences. Again, there's a possibility you guys can have those experiences together. But I assure you, the freedom of being single to do whatever you want is VITAL to your growth and development. Whatever you think is best for yourself, you are definitely strong enough.

"Hello everyone  
I need advice on what to do regarding my marriage. Sorry for my bad english in advance.

  
We married 2 years ago and until half a year ago, everything was totally fine and we matched perfectly. We talked about having kids and buying a house before marriage and both wanted it.  
Until in the beginning of this year. My wife just changed all of her beliefs, goals and wishes.  
She doesn't want to have kids anymore. She doesn't want to buy a house. No plans for the future but her career. She changed to eating vegeterian most of the time, beeing very involved into feminism and equality and she dyed her hair.  
Don't get me wrong, it's totally fine if she changes her mind and i'm all open for discussions and finding different solutions. My problem is that she just changed everything. She doesn't want to talk about it and just get's angry when I start a conversation about anything.  
In general, she seems very unhappy with everything. After many many attemps of talking with her about her mood, she finally told me that this has nothing to do with me but with herself and she is just not happy at the moment.  
She told me that she is unhappy because:  
\- She watches too much TV/Instagram  
\- is tired all the time  
\- Not doing her exercises/workouts  
\- Not getting everything done in time  
\- Not attending all the vacations/events/parties she wants  
\- Not cleaning/fixing our loft enough  
\- Not having enough time for her hobbies  


Again, I understand it and sometimes I'm also not happy because I didn't do something as I planned it before. But she doesn't get out of this hole and in my opinion, it's unrealistic to do all the things she wants to do at the same time. I'm doing a lot of housework right now, because before our marriage we had some conflicts because I sometimes missed doing things and she had to do more than me.  
In the last few weeks, we had some fights regarding these problems. The last one was terrible and she turned very aggressive (verbally) and said very disrespectful stuff against me and hit against doors.  
I told her to stop it immediately and left the building to cool off.  
When we talked about it, I said that this is a dealbreaker for me and if she get's aggressive like this again, I will be gone.  
What do you think should I do in this situation? How can I improve the situation and how can I start to talk to her about all this again?  
I don't know what to do anymore, but I want to make a change and not leave without trying.

TL;DR: Wife changed all her beliefs after marriage and refuses to talk about anything and is constantly aggressive or sad. I don't know how to move forward."	MCCHikK3NZ	post	34.13102505279602	female	White	0.9990076422691345	na	na	na	5	relationships

"Myself (F24) and my boyfriend (M25) have been together for about 10 months.This happened almost 8 months ago but I'm still really hurt over it. My boyfriend when drunk told me that he preferred black women ""because their asses are juicier"" which, I won't even begin to get into how fetishist and demeaning that is towards black women, but it really hurt me. He has since apologized, and stopped drinking, but I've never really forgotten about how much it has hurt me and affected me. 

At another point we broke up briefly because his drinking became out of control, and as soon as I broke up with him, he began talking to two other women planning on hooking up, which hurt me as well. I found out about this from him telling me. 

He has since gotten sober which I'm very proud of him for, but he has made me feel like I'm not important enough to him. I began to realize I've never been taken out on a thoughtful date, I've been the one to make the plans. I've only gotten flowers when I've complained about not getting any. I think I stay because I think its going to change. But I don't know if that's going to happen. On the flip side of this though, he has said beautiful and touching things, like ""you are my settle down woman"". I realize this is consistent with bread crumbling, I am being fed sweet words but shown nothing, and I still hold onto this resentment from his comment about other women who I physically and genetically just could never be. 

How can I bring this up to him?

TL;DR : I am having trouble moving past mean comments he has said, and want to bring it up to him."	missbanana99	post	20.706061629395435	female	White	0.9887840747833252	na	na	na	2	relationships

If he gets angry about that very reasonable boundary, that's a red flag. If you worry he won't understand where you're coming from (weird tbh) and might be hurt (not angry!!) you can give him another option for how he can show affection in those situations: ""You can touch my knee or give me a peck on the cheek instead!"" And if he doesn't adhere to the boundary, next time you give him another warning ""Hey, don't touch my face, please!"" and if that still doesn't help you smack his hand away.

"34NB/33M here

I need some advice on differing assumptions or expectations in a relationship. Things like person A assuming any free time would be spent together, whereas person B assumes any free time is fair game unless it's specifically stated as time with partner.

I think a lot of the assumptions have been due to mononormative conditioning and growing up with parents who were very much one entity rather than two individuals, but I want to try and deconstruct that thinking, do things healthier (for us) and be more intentional about what we want our relationship to look like.

With that said, I don't know where to start! I thought it would be helpful to have a list of all the different expectations etc and we could each go through and put what our preferences are, but my neurospicy brain is overheating with what to include, I know general areas like childcare, housework, social etc but is it too much to hope that there are already lists/resources out there somewhere to help with this?

It's good to know about each others preferences for the big things you mentioned (having children, housework, etc) but I think for the rest of it, it's more important to learn how each other communicate and work on developing your communication skills as a partnership rather than trying to make a comprehensive list of possibilities. Basically, when a situation comes up where the two of you see it differently, you should be able to have a respectful and constructive conversation where you both can express yourselves and feel heard and an equitable compromise/solution is made at the end of it.	_Cassie13_	reply	na	na	na	0.9950224161148071	no	no	no	na	relationships

"For some context, we've been dating for 2-3 years, although we did take a break for a bit in the middle.

We recently moved into a new house together and there's been a lot of forward, positive changes and growth for both of us.

As of lately, however, I feel like I'm doing a lot of the work and lifting. 
I don't want to not give him credit, and I know it's not a competition, but I feel like he thinks he has the harder days and struggles than I do. That being said, he works from home. I've seen him work. He has a lot of free time. He goes to the park during the day, goes to the gym, plays video games, hangs out with the dogs, etc. I'm not saying he has it easy, because I'm sure his job has stressful aspects, but the way he ACTS is that he's just up to his neck in work. If he misses gym time because of a meeting (the audacity), he acts like it's the end of the world and gets sad (this is important for later). He has a set routine and he doesn't like it changed or else he gets irritable. I totally get it.

I'm a medical director, who works on-site, and has to tend to patients literally all day. I love my job, but obviously taking care of people nonstop, there are days that's exhausting. I also work almost an hour away from home. So 2-hour round trip / day. This is a new job, by the way. I started 3 weeks ago. Between changing jobs and houses, I'm also struggling with a bit of change to my routine. On top of that, i have been recovering from a ruptured tendon for almost 9 months now. I haven't been able to workout much, play sports, hike, etc because of it. Essentially, find new hobbies because my typical ones are out. Lately, I've been mentally struggling with this (as if the physical pain isn't enough). I try to explain this to him, as some days I break down crying and he doesn't understand why. It's like missing one of his gym days because of a meeting, but on steroids. He tells me it'll all work out and to cheer up, but that's it. I don't feel like he's actually hearing me.

As if I'm not stressed enough, he literally doesn't initiate anything. He doesn't make decisions. That said, he is happy with yielding it all to me. If I initiate intimacy, he's game. If I initiate date night, he's there. If I initiate plans for the weekend, he's looking forward to it. If I choose dinner, he's happy with it. He tells me that he's just not good at initiating, planning or deciding things. It's getting to a point where I need him to. I feel like I'm doing all the work. After my long days and commute, I want him to take more charge instead of having to do everything myself. I've voiced that it would be nice if he asked me out, or flirted more, or initiated bedroom time. On top of being exhausted from everything, I just simply feel undesirable and I'm so defeated.

When I voice this to him, he typically gets frustrated and angry. He always says that he's trying so hard. He brushes me off most of the time and then I feel ashamed and guilty. Well I finally broke down last night and calmly reiterated everything and then cried. I explained that it could be one date per month that he plans and I'd be thrilled. He looked guilty and worried. This morning he told me he'd do better this week, and that he doesn't want me to feel like this. He kissed me before my commute and told me I was his everything.

He has explained to me that I love him in bold lettering and loudly, whereas he is softer and quieter and behind the scenes with his love. He says that it doesn't mean he loves me less. I try to understand this, but sometimes I feel like I'm always have to squint and read in-between the lines. I just want ... To feel wanted sometimes? Without having to ask for it or find context clues. I just feel like if I have time in my busy week to woo him, work, take care of the house, plan things, etc that I'm not asking for a lot?

Is this a normal progression of living together / being in a relationship? Am I asking for too much? Serious replies please, because I truly never had guidance growing up. I don't know if I'm overreacting or if I'm valid.

TL;DR - Even with having busy lives and changes, I find time to woo my boyfriend and I wish he'd do the same because I'm getting tired of doing everything. I feel bad about voicing this though and don't know if I am overreacting."	random_bananas5	post	23.963922583921754	female	White	0.8314019441604614	na	na	na	3	relationships
"You're not asking too much. Even if your partner was a busy emergency room doctor or CEO, It's reasonable to want them to put effort into your relationship. At the very least, they should be open to communicating with you and negotiating. 

That said, how you explained his job situation sounded a little condescending and judge-y. I feel this might be the root of your issue. If there is anything I've learnt about men it's the number 1 thing they want from their woman is to feel appreciated and respected. Everyone just wants to be accepted as they are. So if you're low-key judging his job or lifestyle choices, he will sense that on some level, and he will not feel accepted, and will drive a wedge between you two.

Bottom line, I think on some level, he's feeling the same way as you: he doesn't feel accepted and appreciated. But maybe he's too afraid to say it. A lot of men are bad at expressing their feelings and needs. To get to a place where you both feel heard, I would approach the conversation from the angle of ""It's really important to me that we BOTH feel appreciated in this relationship."" Ask him: Do you feel appreciated? If not why? If yes, what makes your feel appreciated? Then say, your part: I'm not feeling appreciated and this is what I need to feel appreciated (i.e. you to plan 1 date night a month)."	random_bananas5	reply	na	na	na	0.8314019441604614	weak	no	no	na	relationships

"You're not asking for too much, and if he's trying to minimize or make you feel bad about having basic needs and feelings, that's a biiig red flag. It's manipulative and potentially abusive. But that didn't sound like the case for you. 

Ultiamtely, the main point of my message is when there is an obvious decline in effort and affection in a relationship, it is often a symptom of a deeper issue that needs to be addressed. Meaning there's probably something going on on his side. So instead of addressing the issue from the angle of it's all about you, like ""Im not getting my needs met,"" I find men are generally more receptive and the talk ends up more productive when it's approached making it about BOTH your happiness and inquiring about what's going on on his side too.

You can’t guarantee a good reaction, but the best way of getting one is to empathise with the other person, to think through how your words will make them feel, and to try and frame it in a sensitive way, whilst being honest and respectful.
I would prioritise breaking up with her in a kind way, at least then when you look back at this, you can do so with pride on the way you have handled it, which will make letting it go easier. Handling it badly will be something you remember and hold on to for a long time.

You haven’t mentioned any negativity towards her, so, being honest that you don’t want to do long distance and that you think the world of her, but that you want your focus to be on this new opportunity is all that needs to be said. Be firm on your decision but patient and kind to her reaction."	Loridema	reply	na	na	na	0.9985004663467407	weak	no	no	na	relationships

I’ve had this girl (23F) on my rotation for almost 2 years. Ever since the beging she told me that she does not want a relationship with me, sex is enough, we are not exclusive, she isn’t interested in other guys but I’m free to see other girls. Lately I’ve started to ditch the other girls I’ve been seeing and to harbor some feelings towards her.
Well, this past weekend we went to a 4 day music festival, we had sex a couple times and I left on the 3rd day. Later, my friends told me that they saw her kissing another guy on the 4th day. I confronted her but she denied it, even though I told her that I know I have no reason to be mad as we are not exclusive. She kept saying that she isn’t seeing any other guys besides me.
Today I met with her face to face and I could tell she was lying and feeling guilty. I’m certain that this is a regular occurence but this is just the first time she was caught. While we were together, we cuddled but I wasn’t even arroused by her anymore and barely found her atractive as it felt like she belonged to another man. I can’t help but feel betrayed even though I know I shouldn’t as there never was an exclusive relationship. HELP.

TLDR my nonexclusive friend kissed someone else and I’m feeling betrayed."	sergiulik95	post	7.862140612172347	male	White	0.9986391663551331	na	na	na	5	relationships
"You can feel whatever the hell you want.

When you describe someone as non-exclusively 'on your rotation', then you don't get fidelity from them, or sympathy from anyone else.

Confronting her only demeans you and puts the weakness of your position, and hypocrisy, on full display. You put your self-worth and ego into your ability to maintain access to her sexually. Turns out, you're even less special than you told yourself she was. And this new connection she made, they might be special. Or maybe it'll be the next one. 

She played the game you were trying to play, better than you did. Tough cookies.

If you want to feel better, end it kindly and respectfully, and recognize this a risk you accept when you approach your sexual relationships as casual, non-exclusive rotations of women.

Hello everyone. If anyone takes the time and reads all this I really appreciate anyone's thoughts on if I did the right thing in my relationship with my niece. 

TL:DR at bottom

So real quick I'm 25, my wife is 23, and my niece is 12. I married into the family last year But I've been involved for 6 years. Everything has been great. Its my wifes niece. This past year I got real close and had been spending time with my niece. She got a phone a little while ago and would text me about playing volleyball, sometimes she would ask to play minecraft etc. And if I had the time, I would do those activities with her. I had a real great close relationship with her, and so did my wife. This year my niece is almost 13. She is getting older and is going through puberty still. I'd say from April to July, my niece started getting real touchy with me. Even just being over at my sister in laws house, my niece would act normal but she started like almost being flirty it seemed. She would do stuff like try to hug me with her legs, she ran her foot down my leg while sitting on the couch. And this was when nobody was around. she wouldn't do it if my wife or her mother were in the room. 



At first I thought I was just making something out of nothing. so I let It be. but after a month or two she was still doing things like this. it felt low key flirty. It made me a little uncomfortable because I've known her since she was 6.  I told my wife what had been happening and said I was a little worried she might be trying something with me but I wasnt sure. So to clear things up, me and my wife talked with our niece about it. and basicly asked if she was having any feelings towards me that might feel crush-like. Expecting either a yes or no, we wanted to just maybe establish some boundaries and tell her that her behavior could be taken as flirtatious, especially if she acts that way around boys. ( she has told us before she wishes she could have a boyfriend.) And when we asked her that, she immediately got defensive and was like ""Omg no why would you think that"" And we told her about her behavior but she still denied having feelings. Ok so I guess all good then. So we all patched it up and put the situation behind us. Now I feel a little bit heartbroken because my whole dynamic has changed with my niece since we tried to talk to her about it. 


We still talk sometimes but she doesn't text me anymore asking to play volleyball, or games online. In a way she has been distant. Which maybe I can understand it was an awkward situation. but I miss my niece now. I don't miss the awkward flirtatious things she tried, but just the closeness we had. She felt like a little sister to me and it was pretty cool dynamic we had. Does anyone have any thoughts on what might be going through her head right now? And is there any chance we could be close again as we were? Also was I wrong for even bringing it up because honestly I wish I didn't say anything if I knew it would impact our relationship so much.


TL;DR


My wifes niece was lowkey flirting with me so me and my wife called her out on it, and now our niece is acting distant from us."	MaximumPeavey	post	29.62741211962219	male	White	0.0030890970956534147	na	na	na	3	relationships
"It's totally reasonable for her to distance herself.

She's a pre-teen. Even without that conversation, it was time for her to pivot to investing more in connections with her peers, rather than adults.

I don't think the way you brought it up was the wisest way to handle it, but what is done is done. Let the young person work through what they need too and don't try to rush them or force deeper friendship just because your emotional needs aren't being met.

Your job as another adult in their life right now is to meet them where they are, not to try to keep them playing the role of a fawning six-year-old who adores you. They aren't that anymore.

"Reason I'm posting about this is because it has become an almost daily thought.  
Early 2022, I got out of a lousy marriage, my ex was manipulative and antisocial and it took a long time to realize that, but she was the only person I have dated or slept with and we were together for a total of just under 10 years.  
I went on several dates when I was ready, in the fall of 2022, but none clicked.  
In November 2022, I met my current GF. An incredible person. We had some issues when we first started (you can see my post history) but everything worked itself out.  
I have been working on myself a lot since my divorce, including working out, getting my skin in better health, and dressing better. A few months ago, I got asked out by a coworker who did not know I was dating, so I told her I was and declined. A few weeks later, I got asked out by another person I met only a couple of times, same thing happened.  
I have never thought of myself as attractive and always assumed I would struggle to find a girl after my divorce. Being asked out made me think that I may be more attractive than how I was before.  
My girl and I have once talked about how I never have had casual sex or hooked up with anyone, body count of 2 and both committed, long term relationships. She hasn't really done a lot herself but she did get to explore a bit. She thought it through and later on got upset by the thought that I may have ""missed out"" coz she wants to feel like she is enough, but said that it is not my fault, and that she just feels bad that this is something she wants to but cannot help me with, for me to explore whatever I want in life. But she's not okay with sharing me/opening up the relationship or taking a break...etc (BTW I never brought these suggestions up, she was genuinely thinking about how she can change my perceived lack of sexual exploring).  
Recently though, we've hit 9 months together, and she has been talking about marriage and long term plans. I, on the other hand, have been having growing thoughts of ""what else is out there and what am I missing out on?"", and have a desire to explore sexually. I am having these thoughts daily and they are starting to be a source of discomfort for me. I do not want to lose her, not one bit, but I am human and am afraid of resenting her because of my FOMO.  
Our sexual connection is great, earlier on she said it's the best sex that she has ever had, and recently said that it just keeps getting better and better. But sometimes I am not sure if I should believe that because I think any girl would say that to a guy she wants to marry. I am very very happy sexually with her as well.  
What should I do? How should I reframe these thoughts in a healthier way?  
TL;DR: I have only been with 2 women, both long term relationships, and now I feel more confident about myself/attractiveness and am having thoughts about exploring sexually. I am also deeply in love with my current GF and do not want to lose her."	BBGun92	post	28.9573635706347	male	White	0.002313994336873293	na	na	na	27	relationships

I've had this exact conversation with my husband, ""Do you feel like you're missing out?"" He doesn't dismiss or wave away the question. He genuinely takes a few moments to think it over then says, ""And miss out on what we have together? No, this is once in a lifetime baby. That's just sex out there, they aren't you.

If you're consistently having these thoughts now, they're probably not going to go away or lessen as time goes on/ if you get married etc. I think the better option would be to end things now so that you can explore being single, rather than waiting until you're married with kids and cheating because you can't get this thought out of your head. But you will have to give up a future with this person- if you love her, are sexually satisfied by her, find her attractive, and want to be with her then... what do you think you will find out there? Someone who's better at sex? A better partner? Or is this really just that you think you're hot enough now and want the validation from getting girls?

You just have to make a decision. Either decision is perfectly reasonable. There is no way to k ow what the “right” answer is. You just have to pick one and own your decision.

If you want to be single and play the field - that makes total sense. Break up with her. You may or may not have a hard time finding someone else you are as compatible with. That’s the risk.

If you are happy and want to commit - that’s fine too. It doesn’t sound like this was something that bothered you in your marriage. So - is it just that you are thinking this is what you *should* want? NSA sex is kinda overrated in my books. It’s a little empty and meaningless. But tons of people like it so - no judgement if that’s something you want to try. But if you choose to stay, own that decision.

It's been 5 years and he still tells me he built it so much up in his head and it wasn't what he thought. He to only had me and one other partner. I didn't feel right keeping him, he regrets I didn't.

I was also in a 10-year relationship, but I slept around before and after the relationship. I would describe casual sex as fun at the time but cold afterwards. It's pretty hollow.

"Trust me 

Every girl is the same 

Esp. Pounding randoms, it gets dull and sad real quick

Good sex is about communication and connection and also time 

You're not missing out 

But that feeling of fomo can rot you and ruin a relationship 

Maybe you're not ready to settle down and thats fine but you for sure don't deserve and won't get to have your cake and eat it

Also based on the dates you mentioned, not sure single life is for you, don't look back and regret it 

Tbh most likely scenario is you break up, you try single life, it's shit, you eventually *if you're lucky find a girl as good as this one to settle down with 

But staying in relationship and continuing to feel this fomo will rot you if you can't clear these thoughts

TL;DR - I wanted to move out again but my family wouldn't let me. So i don't know what to do

Some explaination for more context: I live in a family of 5 (me, my brother, father, aunt and grandma) My father was a drug additct and my mom divorced him when i was 3 so i dont have any memory about her, my father never around and our main income was my aunt who live overseas since my father refuse to work and staying at my stepmom house (they're also divorced now).

Growing up, i never experience love like how i expected it should be, no hugs, kisses or pep talk, the love they think and give me is  a roof and food everyday is enough, which until now i still appreciated, but other than that, all i have is verbal abuse and beaten coming from my dad and grandma. From how i was overweight, never pretty, not feminine, nor was i smart enough. Even till this day, my grandma still want to control how i dress and how i style my hair, if i don't do as she said, she will criticized and even dehumanized me, if i tried to talk back, my dad just join in with verbal abuse and most of the time it escelated to them hitting me to shut me up, the more i cry the more i get beaten.
Not only that, anything else i do have to be perfect or else my grandma will beat me up again and if i dare make a squeak, she will call my dad to join in and as they called ""teach me a lesson because i was a bad child"".
I ended up becoming a very shy and cold kid, overweight, having low esteem and scared of people. My education was not good either, i go straight to work after i finish highschool because they said they can't ""afford"" my college fees because they already have to cover for my brother.
I spent my 18 till 22 living like a corpse, only making money and give part to it to my family because they said it was my duty and at that time i'm too depressed to care about it.
My 22 year was an absolute hell because i lose my job and my ex cheated on me. And ofcouse, my family know about this and try to criticized me even more till i reach my breaking point and choose suicide. Fortunately im still here, ended up in a lonely hospital room, i think about my life choices and choose to improve my life and not give up. After 3 years, i got my dream job, a better health, my friends support and a pet cat.

I have move out twice before but always ended up moving back in due to my grandma and my dad making a scene at my workplace and nonstop calling, even at midnight (which is why i get fired from my previous job), she sometimes even threaten suicide to my aunt if i dont move back in because she ""worried"" about me.
Im planning to move out again because i want to be closer to where i work and most of all, no more abuse, but they threaten me again so i don't know what to do. I'm afraid living here because i know some day, i will snap again."	PhilosophyHot4320	post	14.455824024882883	female	White	0.995269238948822	na	na	na	1	relationships

"I (40f) have a far lower sex drive compared to my husband of 15 years (38m)

Webwould have sex maybe once a month or once ever 2 months (even then my husband wanted it closer to weekly or a could of nights in a row) 
But as the kids have got older things have slowed down. 

We do still have sex occasionally (last time was in February) but I'd not miss it if we never did. He seems to be heartbroken by this though. As though it means I think less of him.
The truth is I've never found him all that attractive (he knew when we met that I prefer women) but he acts as though this is a big deal. 

It's not only that I don't find him attractive, as I said, we do have sex and I do enjoy it when it happen, but I hate the idea of the kids (15f + 13m) hearing us. The walls are so thin in our house and our daughter's room is through the wall from ours.
And regardless of that, I go to bed because I'm tired. If I didn't need to sleep I wouldn't have gone to bed. 

There are times during the day, when the kids are out, that he'll suggest we go to bed but I'm busy. When the kids are out I like to clean and tidy up properly, or even have half an hour of quiet time. 

We spoke about it and he suggested setting aside a time when we knew we'd be alone but he doesn't understand that's just not how my body works! I can't decide because it is Thursday evening I'm going to be horny. 
Sometimes I need to see how my body reacts. If he suggests we go to bed I don't want to, if he runs his hand and touches me instead I get tingles and realise I do want to. 

He's stopped trying all together at home lately. He says touching me when he doesn't know if I'm interested makes him feel like he's assaulting me. Especially when I'm definitely not interested. 


I've been away for several weekends this year too and every 5th or 6th trip he'll start to send flirty messages or photos of himself, and it really doesn't do anything for me. I'm polite and make the appropriate 😍 emojis but honestly it's pretty cringy. 
I also know he wants us to sext or me to send photos back but that's really not my idea of fun.

Now he's also started looking for weekend trips away every 3 months but, again, that's not how my body works. We cant just go away and suddenly I'm going to feel like having sex. Also, neither of us really have time or money to go away like that. Not to mention the cost. Or that if we did go, I'd want to do things and would probably be too tired anyway. 
He's not actually booked anything but keeps bringing up how he's never been to *city/town/area* and how it'd be nice to visit it, ""the two of us"" 

How do I make him realise that sex isn't important?
Or that it doesn't matter if somebody, or even nobody, finds him attractive.
I married him, he's a good husband and father and I don't understand how that isn't enough.

"My libido is similar to yours. I can go years without sex and I really don't care much. I've never been able to relate to people who say they ""need to get laid"", because to me, it is not a need.

However, I am a grown up who is not entirely lacking in wisdom, so I recognize that my experience is not the universal experience. I have had many friends who report that they actually need sex. Who am I to tell them that they are wrong about their own needs? Who are you to tell your husband that his needs are wrong because they don't match yours?

I read about so many mean, lazy, selfish men on this forum. And then there's your guy, who is offering you every compromise possible, bending over backwards to try and woo you... and you just shoot every single suggestion he has down. It's literally no wonder his self-esteem is going downwards.

>How do I make him realise that sex isn't important?

Here's a better question: When are you going to realize that you aren't the centre of the universe and other people have different needs than you do?

You say you love him. The way you speak about him makes me doubt your love for him. It sounds like he repulses you. I can't imagine being married to someone who spoke about me this way.

>The truth is I've never found him all that attractive (he knew when we met that I prefer women) but he acts as though this is a big deal.

Of course it's a big deal, jesus christ.

A former friend of mine, who always identified as a lesbian, suddenly decided to marry a man in her early 30s. She later admitted she was using the guy for his sperm and stability. He came from a well-adjusted, happy, relatively wealthy family. He thought the sun shined out her ass. He was convenient, and she used him to elevate herself into the middle class.

On the books, she had a good husband and a good father to her child. But they were deeply miserable together because she was never going to give her husband what he needed: being *wanted*. Truly wanted, not for his assets or skills, but for his *essence*. For who he is, in his body, as a man.

That woman has slowly but surely lost most of her friends over the years, because she thinks she's the centre of the universe. People talk about the way she treats her husband. And now they've finally broken up. He's free of her. I'm happy for him. I hope she returns to her actual self too, because she lived a lie for a decade and that can't be good for her psyche.

If the story of my ex friend sounds familiar, please, just let him go. He deserves to be loved *and* wanted, and you apparently can't offer him the latter."	throwawaya845	reply	na	na	na	0.9987710118293762	no	strong	no	na	relationships

Relationships are about meeting your partners wants and needs selflessly. (As long it isn’t detrimental to one’s life or very illegal) You can’t just say his want isn’t important because you think it isn’t. For example my SO likes certain thing’s sexually that I am personally not comfortable with but for her I will do it. I know it makes her happy and I get enjoyment out of that. If I was in your husband’s situation I would be heartbroken not having my wants or needs met when he clearly tries his hardest to meet yours. You clearly need counseling with him to see that you aren’t doing your part in the relationship. If you don’t choose to do that then tell him how you feel so he can make his own decision on finding a partner who will satisfy what he needs. Sex is important in monogamous relationships. And if you still choose to believe the opposite of that statement then you are in the clear minority that believes that.	throwawaya845	reply	na	na	na	0.9987710118293762	no	no	no	na	relationships
"Alright OP, you're getting absolutely flamed here, and a lot of it is hard to argue against. However, since you're looking for advice, here's what I got.

You're right, sex isn't an absolute requirement for a loving partnership (Asexuals exist), however it is a factor, one your husband clearly considers important. Sex, for him, is a way to physically show, confirm, and build upon the loving bond between the two of you, as it is the most physically intimate two people can be (there's also a bunch of science behind what sex does to the brain but I don't want to go into that, feel free to google it).

Now, you have two choices here; you can choose to work on this with your partner or you can choose to shut it down completely. If it's that latter you got three paths: Divorce, an open relationship, or he finds a way to handle is urges on his own (Toys?). If it's the former, good news! There are things you can do. 

First, your concept of sex only happening due to spontaneous horniness. 

>he suggested setting aside a time when we knew we'd be alone but he doesn't understand that's just not how my body works!

Spontaneous horniness is what most people consider ""being in the mood"", and settle for having sex only when this happens. It comes from the romanticized idea that sex spawns from a ""Spark"" of desire and all that jazz. However, horniness can be planned! Sex generally comes down to three things: Physical Arousal, Mental Arousal, and Willingness. All Consensual Sex has at least one of these three things (Care to guess?). Physical Arousal is the most obvious, the body reacting (being in the mood), Mental Arousal is finding the the situation/idea arousing (smut and romance comes from here) but not necessarily having your body respond, and Willingness is self explanatory. Any of these three factors individually can lead to the others. However for you Willingness is the most immediate concern. It boils down to you not opposing the idea of sex. This does not mean you should drop your pants whenever your husband looks at you funny. You can and should say No when you absolutely don't want to have sex. What it does mean is that when your husband comes to you wanting to be intimate, you evaluate the situation (kids aren't around, you're not busy, etc.) and you can decide, ""Hey, I may not be horny but I'm not opposed to getting there"". Bam! Planned horniness. Again, none of this means you have to have sex whenever your husband's in the mood, you have different Libidos, but at least give it a try every once and a while for his sake.

Now you may be thinking, ""How do I just become horny?"" Well, you've already experienced one way:

>if he runs his hand and touches me instead I get tingles and realise I do want to

Ways to ""get in the mood"" range from things to encourage Physical Arousal like touching, petting, (erotic) massages, foreplay, etc. and encouraging Mental Arousal like romantic dates/getaways, sharing feelings, sharing kinks/fetishes, roleplay, and even porn (visual or written, since your attracted to women this could be a big help for you and he can enjoy it to). 

Now comes your part. Communication. If your willing to work on this with your partner, sit down and have a serious conversation about this. Lay out what you're willing to do and what you would need from him. If he seriously wants to have sex for more than gratification, let him know the type of effort he needs to put in, in terms of Physical Encouragement (touching, massages, foreplay, etc.) and Mental Encouragement (Dates, romance, dirty talk, etc.). Set up some boundaries, maybe a safe word for when you're really not in the mood, but let him know that he can take the initiative and you won't suddenly think he's a sex offender. Plan for alone time with just two you, a romantic weekend or getaway that he proposed is the perfect way to explore these new trial runs. 

Now don't think you're off the hook now OP, and that it's all on him now. You can also put in some effort, even PG stuff like hugs and hand holding can mean the world to him. You claim to love this man, show him. This also extends beyond just in terms of sex. There may be other reasons for his motivation to have sex, which could include not feeling effort on your part to show him he is loved. Use your love language to show him that you care. Plan some dates for the two of you (nonsexual intentions is fine), maybe include the kids. All in all make him feel appreciated, respected, and loved. 

Other things that can help the two of you is Therapy (individual for each of you) and marriage counseling. 

That's pretty much all I'm willing to dish out rn, if you want more advice there are plenty of books, videos, podcasts, and professionals who can enlighten you on these topics.

This is a crazy way to view this. People actually do NEED to feel desired, physically intimate and sexually satisfied in a healthy relationship- for most people that is a need for them to be in a loving and mutual partnership.

"Your Welcome OP, I appreciate the appreciation :). I hope that the other hurtful feedback here isn't getting to you too much. Negative criticism has its place but some of these comments are just vindictive. 

As for the advice you were looking for, if you give an honest try to working through this with your partner, attempt to genuinely compromise but find that you are just done with sex, you still have hope. to make Sex less important you would need to address the root cause and work on it. Physical intimacy means a lot to a lot of people, but it isn't for everyone. Love is a complicated thing that we all have our own personal, special definition for. I don't know what yours is, but regardless I ultimately believe that love is a choice. All those special feelings that one might describe as love feeling like; butterflies, safety, contentment, respect, trust, or whatever, are not what love is. Love is the choice to take all those feelings in, to cherish, protect, nurture and allow these feelings to grow and mature. The choice to fight to bring these feelings back when they fade or to find something new to take its place. I don't know your love story, I don't know what made you fall in love with your husband, to start a family with him, and to stick with him for 15 long years, only you know these things. Look back on these things and find ways to incorporate them in your present. (If you need, a professional like a personal therapist or a marriage counselor can help the two of you figure these things out) Do things you both love doing together, put in effort like I mentioned in my original reply. You can find new things to do together (Ex. take couples dance classes), start hobbies together, plan for short and long term projects together (anything from vacations to planting trees). It is your Choice.

Then he shouldn't be pressured into staying married with you.

"I found out today that my husband cheated on me four years ago. I was using his phone when a message from someone saved under a woman's name popped up and I opened it, all it said was ""hey"". It was the first text since 2020. I read farther back in their chat thread and I found out that one month into our relationship, he started talking to this girl. Not really just talking but more like a full blown relationship. It was full of I love you's and plans for dates. I decided to dig a little deeper into his other texts at the time and I found four other women he was also talking to. Those were just sexts, but he was in a relationship with me, her and was sexting these other women all at the same time and I'm wondering if it is still going on. How do I get the truth from him? Just from looking at the texts it seems like he isn't cheating now, however it also appears that some things may have been deleted and I can't see them now. We have had a couple fights recently where he has accused me of cheating even though I've given him no reason to suspect that and it feels like he's projecting. I do not want a divorce, but I also don't know where to go from here. What do I do now? Also, how do I get the whole truth?

Hi, I was you until recently ending things and I recommend you do the same before you put yourself through hell trying to make this “work”. I found out about “past” cheating years into the relationship. They get better at hiding it, he never told me the full truth and I went crazy downloading app data and email archives and every single time he’d only admit to more and swear “that was it” once I showed him the proof (it was never “it”). It doesn’t stop OP, and you won’t ever stop feeling paranoid nor will he get your trust back. He hid this SO easily from you because if you knew back then you probably would have left. It’s not fair to you and he is robbing you of happiness and a genuine relationship with someone who won’t cheat. I am really sorry you are going through this and it’s honestly so painful, but it is better to get out now than when you have a family / any longer into the marriage.

"It was one month into your relationship.

Did you actually have a conversation about being exclusive? Or did you just assume once you started dating then that was it, you are in a closed relationship?

If you never had the conversation and you two were on different pages then he could have been dating other women then decided to let them go and focus on you.

In other words, it might not have been cheating at all. Depends on if you spoke about it and if you both come from similar perspective of dating vs relationships. 

And considering you don’t see any evidence of this cheating after about a month in (at which point he determined to be serious with you and drop the others) he might not be a cheater at all.

All in all, the best way to TRY to get the truth is to get screenshots of the messages and confront him with them when he accuses you of cheating. And ask him if that's why he keeps questioning you."	CheaterThrowaway424	reply	na	na	na	0.9893679022789001	no	no	no	na	relationships

So realistically since you don’t want to divorce, just tell him you know about his cheating because you saw the text and can see that. Tell him that you found out about how he cheated on you, tell him matter of factly that you have never cheated on him and that you don’t appreciate being projected on, and tell him that you want to go to couple’s therapy to repair this marriage but it means him atoning for and moving past his infidelity. 

Realistically, if he wasn’t honest with you for the past few years, there isn’t any magic words that will make him suddenly open up to you today.

"Had you discussed being ""exclusive"" at the time or did you just assume you were? 

Once you became exclusive has he texted anyone since? 

It's not cheating if you weren't exclusive or had discussed being exclusive, just someone keeping their options open. It sucks for sure, but if you weren't in a committed & exclusive relationship at the time having expressly said as such, it's not cheating.

My question to you is are you happy in your relationship? If so decide carefully what you say to him. Because you've invaded his privacy going through the phone searching for OLD messages. If they were current sure be angry, but you went looking. 

I'm sure there are messages on your phone from past relationships that you haven't even thought about. But had he searched them he'd probably be equally hurt.

Regarding asking you if you're cheating, this maybe projection or it may be someone undermining your relationship to him (it happens unfortunately). Or it maybe a real fear.

My parents were married for 50 years but early on my mum had a nightmare that my father cheated on her. She couldn't lol at him or talk to him for days. He had no clue what he'd done wrong. Until she finally spoke to him. It was a dream yes, but it was a genuine fear also. She had seen friends be cheated on by partners.

"So many redditers ""go to"" comment is for people to destroy their relationships. 🙄

The fact that he was still seeing someone 30 days into your relationship, and that was years ago, is not much of a deal IMHO. Possibly, if you discussed explicitly that neither of you would see anyone else, but when did you discuss that? On your first date? 30 days isn't very long.

Is he cheating now? Well, I don't know. It sounds like you don't either, but you suspect he is. I have to say, I personally think clicking on his message and going through his phone was a huge violation of trust and of his privacy. Ideally, you can talk to him about this and how you feel, but it is highly unlikely that hes going to admit he was cheating if he is. So where will that leave you? You can keep snooping wirh the hope that you will assuage your fears or comfirm your suspicions.

"He broke your trust - and that's not easy to fix.

Start with an honest conversation with him.  Try, with everything you have, to keep the conversation civil - but let him know that you know and that he will have to take steps to regain your trust - because you can't love someone you don't trust.

That he is accusing you of cheating is a big warning flag.  

What steps:

1. Telling you everything - everything about what he has done Giving you full and unconditional access to all his electronics
2. Giving you access to all accounts - social media, financial, email, messaging....
3. Let you track his location by sharing his location
4. Deleting any apps that are inappropirate - snapchat, messaging apps that you don't use, tinder....
5. Stop gaslighting you by claiming you are cheating

I'm sorry your husband did this. One thing I would advise is to get the timelines organized. Are all these messages from a point in time when you were both still dating and not in a clearly defined monogamous relationship, like the early days and weeks of dating before you became a couple? Or are they from a time when you were going steady and definitely defined yourselves as a couple? I'm not trying to diminish your experience in any way, but from the sounds of it, it seems like you found texts from a time when you first started dating, and in the modern day most people assume that the other person may be talking to other people at least in the first couple days or weeks of figuring out and forming a relationship. If I'm way off base here and you were boyfriend and girlfriend at the time then I'm sorry, and please ignore what I've said. But with this situation it's important to get the dates right.

How long did he see her? Were the two of you just dating a month and he also had some other prospects. I think that may be common for some women, and it’s just part of early dating. Once things get serious for a person then they cut those other ties. Sometimes they shut down the in person interactions (so no more hookups) but still throw out some messages as a way to end things with out having the “I’m not interested in you anymore” conversation. Just consider that what you have Now or even a few months into the relationship does not compare to what was going on that first month. Did he know you had an expectation of matrimonial commitment and fidelity after only a month of dating? Sounds like he was actively dating and was lucky to find you. The others clearly didn’t compare and were not of your caliber. OR was he seeing her a year into your relationship? As far as the texts go, it’s not unreasonable that someone else made an impression but that doesn’t mean he could really make a life with them. Maybe they were too crazy or dramatic. Maybe they were unstable. The real concern was whether this continued when you got into marriage talk and discussion of real commitment. Was he seeing here then? Cause by then there was an expectation of committed trust and he was definitely being unfaithful. Just process the bus for a while and see if you are ready to get divorced. You don’t have to choose divorce but you need to mentally prepare for the possibility BEFORE you decide to tell him you found out he was seeing someone else that first month.

1 on 1 relationships are hard with 8 billion humans on earth. 

Maybe there is room for you to do what you want. But if you want him exclusively and it doesn't bother you that he chats with other girls, etc. 

What does it matter he cheated on you if you love what he does with you. It just makes you mad, obviously. That he hid it. But so what, you can't fix the past and it didn't bother you until you found out. 

Let's just assume that his stupid hobby of chasing other girls was just that. It'd be like him playing online video games all day and ignoring you same difference.

Ok let me know, I'm a good counselor. He wasted a lot of time chasing girls on the outside. But sure, he was attracted to them just as he was to you.

I believe in multiple marriage 

TLDR : you married a ceo of dating a bunch of women, what you gonna do about it now, did the past bother you? BUT IS HE ABUSIVE? SEEMS SO IF HES ACCUSING YOU OF CHEATING. so hire a male counselor a hot one through church or something to mediate and see where that leads."

"It’s always a guilty conscience, or most of the time it is. If someone is accusing you of cheating and you know full well you are an extremely loyal individual, I’m sorry, but it’s usually their guilty conscience. My wife of 4 years started to accuse me of cheating, always thought I was too clueless to know when a girl is flirting with me etc. turns out it was her guilty conscience. If you start to think about your marriage over the last couple years. There’s going to be a lot of red flags, or times your instincts suspected something was up, but you talked it down in your own head. I know I did that for the entire marriage. Once you open your eyes to the red flags, and connect the dots to times your instincts didn’t settle. You’ll prob have all the truth you need, or at least a list of instances you want answers too from him. I hope this helps, it does get better. I’m 2.5 months into it, got counseling and I’m now coping with it so much better. Your life and your future quickly turns much brighter and you suddenly have your ambition back again for yourself. Stay strong, keep loving! I promise not all guys cheat, much like I had to keep telling myself not all woman cheat. Stay strong



Edit: I also see people wondering why you want to stay. It’s because of the trauma bonding and the years of abuse you’ve probably been subjected to without even realizing it. I tried to get back with my x wife even after she was dishonest and cheated for God knows how long. So I get it! But it’s the abuse and the trauma bonding you’ve experienced and that makes you want to stay. Or say “well he was really good to me ag this time” “or no I don’t think he could cheat on me for our entire marriage.”  Do some reading on abusive relationships and the physiological effects of trauma bonding and what it makes your actual body do and feel. Don’t forget to read into the psychological of it all too. Time will heal all, focus on self care, therapy, go to the gym, eat healthy, write out goals and accomplish them."

"Take copies of everything and be ready for him to lie! Check his deleted folder on his phone and maybe before you confront him see if you can check any other apps he might be using to talk to other woman like WhatsApp, Reddit and Facebook. He may not be using dating apps but their are lots of ways to connect online with woman. Also check his recently downloaded apps or his App Store to see if he’s downloading and then deleting apps like tinder when he gets home. Have a look at his camera roll as well as his photo albums for any selfies or NSFW photos or videos that he’s taken and not shared with you or for any album that might contain other woman’s photos that have been sent to him recently. Once you’ve checked everything then you need to confront him but allow him to come clean with information so don’t show your hand all at once. 

Once you’ve done that you can decide how honest he’s being and if you want to work on staying together or if you are better off breaking up. Just be ready for some trickle truthing as well as a little gaslighting."	CheaterThrowaway424	reply	na	na	na	0.9893679022789001	no	no	no	na	relationships
"You're 25 years old. It's so easy for you to start anew. What does the future hold with him?

First of all you might get an STD from him. One that makes you unable to have children. Your husband could leave you then  because he wants kids and can get them with someone else. 
How will that be for you?

He might give you a disease that can't be cured. Maybe you'll have to tell every possible future sex partner that you have HIV, and they might reject you for it. Expensive drugs to keep it managed. 
How will that be for you?

Or even the less dramatic, more common herpes. Think about sores on your genitals whenever you get a bit stressed out or just randomly. It'll never go away. You have to tell possible future sex partners about that too. 
How would that be for you?

Tour husband might leave you. He's already shown a willingness to not only cheat, but have a loving relationship with someone else. What happens when he finds someone he prefers to you? He will leave you on his terms and you'll scramble to piece together a life with the leftovers you're lucky enough to get.
Is that what you want?


You'll never get the clarity you think will magically heal these wounds. If he was the person to give that you'd have already gotten it.

"Your husband cheating on you 4 years ago, frigging sucks. Having to find out about it only now vs him telling you eventually is SCARY. Wondering if he is still doing it is totally normal and unfair to you. 

It's one thing if he has been spending these last few years being transparent and vulnerable and upfront and accountable with you in every way so you can talk to him and he can address your very warranted insecurities and fears properly. But you have already mentioned his recent habit of creating a toxic hostile environment accusing you of things you have never done. Which you know is a red flag. 

You know a man who cheats, lies, manipulates, and gas lights you isn't a man who values and cherishes you. But only you can decide if he is capable of doing the work within himself to be redeemable.

"In my opinion you can’t find out the whole truth through digging only. 

If you don’t want to leave him you have to confront him, get him to tell you everything. If he is a good person which I highly doubt, he might let you in. But the more you know, won’t it be tougher for you to ignore? If you really want to stay with him the less you know might be better for you. 

Try talking to him, tell him that you know everything but you still want to make this work and take things from there. Get help from a professional. Over time you may find it in your heart to forget it all and things may work out or you may find the strength to leave him eventually. 

But please take some more time and ask yourself if all the pain would be worth it. And I’m sorry for what you’re going through, dear. May god make it easy for you.

If not, why is this person texting you? If you want to stay married and not have any issues, make sure you block and never speak to any woman who you’ve been with in the past and know that I love you and hope you stay faithful and honest.” And he will say sorry about that and “I promise I am not cheating.

If he has an iPhone there is that private album. Odds are if you don’t have proof he will deny it. I doubt thing ended with her. She wouldn’t just text 4 years later. Look her number up. Then look at her social media. That’s how I finally figured out who the AP was when my husband left. I put her phone number and her Facebook popped up. Then my best friends husband’s AP would post on social media to her sister how they went and did things. Then when he was supposed to have cut it off I had seen she checked in to a location that was near where he was supposed to be and so I called my bff  And she went and sure enough he was there. I also think you need proof for yourself. Because we want to believe it’s not true. So as soon as he makes an excuse you will believe it. The fact he never told you means he didn’t retreat it and also he planned to keep doing it. If he felt guilty he would have told you. He’s been lying so easily all these years.

The audacity is astronomical in this post. He wants you to be loyal but himself wants to have relationship with other women. You're 25 and young. Would you really want to be in you late 30s and 40s to suddenly have an awakening that you don't wanna live like that? You'll be wasting your best years on a cheater? Do you want your cheating husband to father your children (if you want any that is)? Imagine if you have a daughter, would you want her to learn that it's okay for men to cheat? What if he leaves you once you get older for his AP? Men (women who cheats as well) like him can't be trusted. If you choose to be with him you will constantly find yourself on edge, wanting to find out whether he is cheating or not. There is no emotional stability. You said you don't want to divorce him, then why do you want to know whether he is cheating or not? What difference is it going to make, cause you clearly want to stay in this marriage.

"Man. 

Well, firstly, obviously he was cheating back then on one and maybe both of you, depending on what the other girl knew at the time, also. 

That said, having looked through his phone, it seems he obviously doesn’t delete messages from girls, even when the behaviors described in those messages would be condemning. So, it would seem to me that if he was still cheating, you would find evidence of it in more recent text messages. 

THAT SAID 

There is all sorts of ethical flotsam and jetsam added to this problem because, unless the two of you have a prior understanding and agreement that you have full access to each others’ phones at any time, without preamble, then it seems to me that there may have been a serious violation of his privacy, cheating or not. 

For a similar reason to why prosecutors aren’t allowed to use evidence that was found without having first obtained the proper search warrant, it casts a very dubious light on the information gathering when that information was obtained through dishonest/unethical means (i.e., going into his phone and reading through his messages without having gotten consent from him). 

If you going through his phone was on the up and up, and he knows/permits you to do so at any time without asking him, then disregard the latter point of my comment. 

That said, if he DOES let you go through his phone as you please, and he also doesn’t delete years’ worth of damning evidence of his prior infidelity, he’s a freaking MORON and you should leave him on those grounds alone 😂"	CheaterThrowaway424	reply	na	na	na	0.9893679022789001	no	strong	no	na	relationships

"Because there is zero evidence that he ""cheated"" other than 30 days after they met. It seems very unlikely that he cheated and then just stopped.

"If you want to try and get more information (you might not actually get the whole truth, if there is something he can still keep from you, he probably will), I would suggest not letting him know that you want to stay with him. Do not give him any sort of compassion or love during the conversation. Don't say very much, just say you are disgusted and appalled and that the trust has been completely broken, then tell him if he doesn't tell you everything, you will leave immediately. Ask him to hand you his phone and all other devices (and accounts on everything, and apps) and just tell him you're going through it all right now, otherwise you will leave (or something else, such as send the evidence to family or friends, or the girls. Just something that will really scare him, because the less scared he is of negative consequences, the less information he will give you).

If he doesn't want to give you the things, begin leaving right away. Pack up your stuff etc. He might give you some information. If he doesn't, just follow through and leave. Even if you don't want to leave, just go somewhere else and be very convincing. 

If it's possible to withhold some of the worse pieces of information, he will, if there's no evidence linking to it. If there is evidence, he might give it to you in the hopes of you staying. It depends how badly he wants to stay with you. The key is to make him as scared as possible of what will happen if he doesn't tell you what you want to know. 

If you go in with compassion and empathy and love, he almost definitely will just try and do as much damage control as possible. People who are willing to do things like cheating are troubled and usually miserable. It might seem like they're one-upping people and getting what they want, but habitual lying, cheating, stealing etc. to get what you want/need is a huge sign that the person feels that they have to resort to this behaviour in order to meet their needs, they don't feel able to do it through healthy productive means. They usually have a lot of self hatred and are generally having a bad time of life, probably with some exceptions but I honestly think that's true. For this reason, he's completely used to and probably doesn't feel much conscious guilt in routinely lying and cheating. If you go in with love, he's likely to just latch onto that. A regular person with a lot of guilt for such behaviour (people who don't do the behaviour in the first place) would want to tell everything, to get the guilt off their chest and to be good to their partner, but if he's already serially cheated, he is not in this position. He will most likely try to tell you as little as possible, even after you ask, so you need to motivate him through fear of severe and scary consequences.  

Tbh I would just leave him after I got the information I wanted. People saying ""why do you want the information? just leave him"" yeah, okay, but sometimes it feels good to just know what's up. People aren't just rational robots who take the most coldly efficient and beneficial course of action, it's a marriage, she's hurt, she wants to know. Probably everyone here would want to know.

My friend told me to dump him immediately, I wish I had listened. I went through a whole year of relationship which only brought my self esteem so low because of his constant criticisms and mouth droooling over half naked vegas girls he’d meet in vegas during travelling only to turn around and make me sound crazy for being upset. Then he’d accuse me of gaslighting and that there was something wrong with me. 
What a horrible human being. Karma got him though. He lied more to me to get into the relationship with me, eventually cheated on me when all I wanted was out of the relationship but he pulled me in saying he loves me then went and cheated and then his so called company that he used his sweat and blood to build eventually failed many years later and he lost 100k.

He deserved every bit of it. He’d criticise me for using things that everyday girls use like makeup. What a nutter.

No. He got it about two years into our relationship because he was cheating on me and he was worried I’d find out. I was pregnant two years into our relationship. I didn’t have it though by luck.

I agree. It’s better to focus on what is happening now rather than what happened 4 years ago. Is your relationship otherwise doing good? Are you satisfied? I would not let him know that you know anything and keep your eyes peeled. Trust your instinct if something is off and then investigate accordingly. You probably feel very blindsided by these findings but they are more common that people would let you know, doesn’t mean those people are monsters or serial cheaters.

"That just switches the relationship to a controlling and toxic one of never having trust if you have to do all that. I'd never want my partner to have full access to those things, not because I'm cheating, but because privacy, ESPECIALLY financial.

And being in one of those relationships in the past, I would spend hours digging through their phone and I only hurt myself ""why do you still have a picture of your ex and you from 3 years ago?"" Hell I'm sure I have stray picture of my exes that slipped my clearing out the camera roll.
""What's this text from 4 years ago?"" Not many people go back and delete whole text threads. My current bf had 500 unopened texts-im sure if I had the desire to look I'd find something to be hurt about even though it happened before me. 
""Why didn't you text me back right away even though I see here in your Google search history you were on your phone at this time and I texted you two minutes prior""
""Why is there porn in your history?"" Shit I watch it too, but I'd find a way to be upset about that too.

Shit gets out of hand, I will find something to twist my stomach in knots, and my anxious attachment WILL cloud my judgment and make these little things into ""sure signs"" my partner doesn't want me or love me over the stupidest shit that I'm even guilty of.

Unrestricted access to another person's phone is NOT the answer.

"The exact same thing happened to me 2 years ago. We hadn't met yet, but agreed on being exclusive and were together for 6 months, then this happened. I didn't have any proof except a screenshot he sent on a group of a dating app that he claimed to not have. When I told him I saw it, he confessed everything and when we met he showed me every possible chat and dates and regretted it very much. Through this talk you might hear excuses and truths and it might hurt you a lot. I dealt with that by being open as well for some time to people who were interested in me (that's because I'm not strictly monogamous despite preferring monogamous agreements in relationships) and the longest conversations with him, he understood it well. We had trust issues for a year, and still do sometimes, but even when it got really hard, he didn't hesitate in showing records, didn't delete anything, and talked to me for hours straight, all night, if I needed to. He's completely available and reachable over phone too. So you need to analyze how the person reacts to your new insecurities that they caused. You need to be careful if they're angry or annoyed at you, if they are blaming you for what they caused, gaslighting you and so on. I really think the conversation is worth a shot and then evaluate if it's worth dedicating yourselves to this rough patching path and also acknowledge the possibility of your relationship being damaged for good. 
Also, I truly recommend getting in touch with your support network. I know it's a long relationship but you can get out of that relationship anytime.

Trust needs to be earned. She can't just decide to trust him - nor should she spend her life obsessively checking his social media.

"Of course it needs to be earned. And finding texts from ages ago does mean trust is damaged but not irreparable. What I do think will make it irreparable, is a full blown investigation into his phone. As someone who has had these situations in 3 past relationships, it is NOT helpful to snoop, even if they permit you to have full access. I was always snooping and did I find any evidence of cheating? No. Maybe a little too much porn for 2 of them for my comfort, but I mostly just found a whole bunch of other things to be suspicious of. I'd scour their search history and photos. I'd dig through every app, dig through social media, literally every person they followed, every post they'd like. I didn't mean to go that far of course, but where's the limit?

For OPs sake, I'm hoping she wouldn't have the same slippery slope most people do when they start snooping - it is so mentally exhausting for both people and kills any chances you will have for a healthy relationship.

She can't just decide to trust him, but she CAN decide if she wants to go down the rabbit hole of unrestricted access to your partners phone if he allows it.

If he doesn't allow her too (because he has that right, it is his private property and personal life, and important information like bank and passwords and such) - then she has another decision which is either to leave the relationship, or to respect that and find another path to figuring things out.

If she can't find evidence of him cheating outside of that first month, then what? You think he's going to feel good, you think she is?

He even told me that he can't get past the traditional roles cause that's how he grew up, but still expected me to shovel the snow, pass the lawn mower, etc cause I was working from home and he wasn't so I had the ""time"" to do it. It was to the point that whenever I heard the door unlock, I'd get up cause I was scared he'd be mad if he saw me sitting on the couch instead of making dinner. He would get annoyed if I hadn't done laundry...even when I was extremely sick. He was also extremely rude but never made comment on my physical appareance. The only complaints was that I smelled too bad down there at times (gotta agree and never understood why cause I wash myself everyday). Surprisingly, with my new boyfriend, I've NEVER had that smell again so it's super weird. He would be extremely rude on many other aspects and it's just went downhill when he bought me a dog. My mom was also emotionally abusive so I can relate to that and she would probably tell me something like that for sure😭 That's honestly an awful thing to say to their children though, I really don't understand that mindset of telling things like that to your kid. My mom always said that some of my friends and my sister were prettier than me. She would also say that my sister would be more popular than me in high school so it's fuuuuuun"	CheaterThrowaway424	reply	na	na	na	0.9893679022789001	no	strong	no	na	relationships

I'm with you on this. It's important to look at this situation with a cool head. OP has not found anything to suggest her partner has cheated on her in the past four years of their relationship, beyond a few texts from the first few weeks of their relationship. If it's from when they first started dating, I would think that it's reasonable to assume he was talking to a few other women at the time as he was a single man, who was still dating. If the texts were from a time when they were a clearly defined couple, like boyfriend and girlfriend, then that's a different story. Very few people assume monogamy from a person they've only known for 30 days, and have only gone on a few dates with, unless it's stated within the context of their dating that they can't date other people.

You sound triggered. Are YOU a cheater? Also- she said it looks like he deleted texts too which tells me he is probably guilty. There nothing terrible about telling someone to leave a liar and a cheat. He could have told her and didn’t. He is also accusing her of being a cheat which is a red flag when he has no grounds for this. There is a lot wrong in this situation and OP knows it.

I'd like to know what that conversation of exclusivity was. It's fucked up, but just to be the devil's advocate here - they were both fairly young, and to commit to someone for 4 years is kind of a big deal, especially if the texts to others stopped after that one month mark. I hope for OPs sake she finds out if he cheated or not again after that one month, so she has some peace of mind.	CheaterThrowaway424	reply	na	na	na	0.9893679022789001	no	no	no	na	relationships

I'm actually not trying to defend a cheater. I don't even know if he was or was not a cheater. My point is people jump to conclusions about somebody else's relationship without having nearly enough information. The point about the conversation is it wouldn't be the first time two people had a conversation and had different ideas what the conclusion was. I've literally seen people have a conversation about how much they really enjoy spending time together and one of them assumes that means they're exclusive and the other just thinks it means they're enjoying each other's company. So unless you know exactly what the agreement is you don't know whether he was reasonable to think they were not exclusive.

He very well may be cheating, but there's nothing thus far giving any proof that he's sleeping with other women. The most I got out of this is that OP is having difficulties in her marriage. The comments in this thread are far too encouraging of OP blowing up her marriage.

You're missing the point here. They only started dating 30 days prior and while SHE says they were in a committed relationship, if he did not have that same understanding, he wasn't cheating. I have seen people have a conversation and leave with opposite conclusions. You say I'm defending a cheater. It's not true. What I'm doing is saying you (she) needs to atleast consider that he didn't think he was doing anything wrong. If he was knowingly cheating, then fine. Send him down the road. But if this thing that happened 4 years ago wasnt even something that was actually cheating, it would be ridiculous to throw away a marriage. Im not defending HIM.
