"We're looking to recruit new members to our mod team. If you're interested in being a moderator, understand the subreddit, and want to help build this community, then we'd like to hear from you!

**Responsibilities**

Some of the responsibilities of a moderator include:

1. Read and approve/remove all posts according to community rules.
2. Respond to modmail.
3. Deal with the trolls.
4. Help settle any issues that arise on the subreddit.
5. Update the wiki with new sections, updated links, or info.
6. Be easily reachable by the rest of the team.

**Deadline**

If you would like to be considered, please send in your application by **Monday 31st July**. The link to apply is [https://forms.gle/56vEsw9LbquKbxgA8](https://forms.gle/56vEsw9LbquKbxgA8).

**Advice**

Moderating can be a draining and sometimes thankless job, especially on a subreddit of this nature. We would recommend you only apply if you are not easily affected by the content of this subreddit, and if you are genuinely interested in fostering a community. The last thing we'd want is for joining the team to be detrimental in any way!

We look forward to reading your applications!

"Hi all,

&#x200B;

We have been getting an increase of reports about trolls, creeps and overall horrible people dming users, and we just want to jump on this ahead of time

**Tl;Dr** \- stranger danger, don't believe everything you read on the internet, don't feed the trolls, we love you - Mod Team

&#x200B;

**Not long enough,** ***will*** **read (Nle;Wr):**

First and foremost **do not feed the trolls**. Trolls want a reaction out of you, they want some sort of feedback that what they've said/done has upset you, and responding in any way, *even to mock their attempts*, feeds them, and that's not what we want. 

1. Ignore the troll
2. Report their account (you can send a report on [reddit.com/report](https://reddit.com/report))
3. Block them so they can't continue to message you
4. (Optional) If you want, you can message the modmail with their username so that we can keep an eye out for them, but our advice will usually be to report to the admins and let them deal with it

The same applies for creeps who ask for pictures or in some way sexualise harming. **Do not engage with them**. Report and block them, don't interact with them in any way shape or form. They want to upset you and if they know they've got to you it'll motivate them to continue and maybe encourage them to look for another target

&#x200B;

In terms of internet safety, you shouldn't really be talking to strangers, you don't know who they are and anyone could lie about their age/gender/sexuality/location/species/opinions on [pinapple on pizza](https://imgur.com/gallery/tinP4)/etc.

You should always steer on the side of caution; don't reveal information about you that shows you're a potential target and take anything said to you with a pinch of salt. This doesn't mean that everyone you speak to is trying to hurt you, but it's better safe than sorry when it comes to your wellbeing and safety

&#x200B;

This goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway: you are worth so much more than those trolls. You're amazing people and we want to make sure you're safe. Your safety is the reason why this community was made in the first place and the best way we can ensure that is if we all look out for each other, and look out for ourselves too

/r/selfharm is a safe space and we will do everything in our power to keep it that way, but we need your help keeping it the emo-paradise that we have come to know and love so much. Report, block, and keep being awesome!

Love, 

The mods"	mik31035	post	25.02840487771035	female	White	0.018634160980582237	na	na	na	28	selfharm
"You guys are so nice, seriously.  It's enough to melt the coldest heart.  I mean, maybe not mine, but close.  

The internet is faceless, I get the distinct impression that folks here are quite young, and even if you aren't, you can find yourself in a bad situation pretty easy.  I was groomed for two years by someone I considered a friend, I knew them well and trusted them.  They took advantage of that.  Be careful with the people you surround yourself with, especially here--in an area where you make yourself vulnerable.

People will try and do a lot of crappy things because the world is full of crappy people.  I recall some dude messaging me on Instagram, turns out he enjoyed going around and seeing if he could make people off themselves and I fit his profile.  You never know when someone might make a move out of the blue, even someone you've known for a while.  

We all got enough problems as it is, don't let an internet stranger give you more.  It's not a particularly friendly thing to do.  Stay frosty."	mik31035	reply	na	na	na	0.018634160980582237	weak	no	no	na	selfharm

I’m still clean (384 days today) but man it really sucks seeing the scars fade more and more every day. And you’re constantly reminded of them as well. So I just go on with my life, doing whatever and I’ll see my scars fading and it puts me in such a bad mood. Like what am I supposed to do when they’re completely faded? Then there is no physical manifestation of how shitty I was doing and all that time I was so miserable was just for nothing. I miss when they were worse.	unicarl	post	18.866920658117266	male	White	0.9975099563598633	na	na	na	2	selfharm
"While I’ve witnessed my daughter fighting the impulses you’ve worked so hard to overcome, and while I’ve worked to overcome my own different shit, I know you are experiencing complex emotions that I can’t understand. I know what you’re experiencing is layered and nuanced and the furthest thing from simple. Acknowledging that I may miss the mark here or sound clueless, I hope what I say next comes across in the spirit in which it’s meant:

In my mind, it will never be for nothing. You’re past trauma, the immense gravity of the horrors you’ve faced and the unimaginable strength you’ve demonstrated to overcome them cannot be erased. It doesn’t matter whether they are etched in your skin. In a world where we’re so quick to judge people by the smallest superficialities, you now have a super power. When others judge and write off those that are struggling with SH or eating disorders or the other maladaptive coping strategies we find ourselves clinging to in our effort to survive this life, you will see deep worth. You will be able to empathize and understand and help in ways others can’t. And when you speak, there will deep wisdom borne of experience that can’t be faked. That will ring a metric fuck ton louder than the brightest scar your skin could hold. I know you and my daughter and others experience intense feelings when looking at and thinking about scars. I know seeing the scars can itself become a reward. These things aren’t easy. I can’t pretend to understand. But I hope you will
come to see it’s how these things have shaped who you are and not your skin that does and will matter. 

Two quick points:
1. Focus on your own recovery first before sharing your super power. Your energy is precious. Make sure you’re recharged before trying to lift the burdens of others. You can’t draw water from an empty well. 
2. As hard as it is, do your best to understand that looking externally for validation or confirmation of what you’ve experienced will almost always result in disappointment. You know who you are, what you’ve experienced, and just how fucking strong you have been to get to 384 days.  Any asshole that needs to see a scar that still has red in it to appreciate what you’ve experienced isn’t worth a second of your life. 

Whether your scars are red or raised can’t change who you are. They are a part of you but they do not define you. You are infinitely complex and much more than any one thing. I wish I could be as strong in anything as you’ve been getting to a year plus. I’m going to be celebrating you today, you fucking legend."	unicarl	reply	na	na	na	0.9975099563598633	weak	strong	no	na	selfharm

You're not a joke, you can't expect yourself to be perfect and to heal right away. Putting this kind of pressure on yourself will just make you feel worse if you end up relapsing. Self harm is very hard to just quit cold-turkey. I believe you can do it, but you need to be patient with yourself. You're hurting yourself mentally by beating yourself up after hurting yourself physically, and you've already been hurt enough. Kindness is what you deserve now, not more pain.

Well I did the same thing, really i told myself that i wouldnt sh and then i sh’d. Its normal if its by instinct or if you have tough emotions, but once you do, I advise trying to distract yourself from cutting, read a book, scream into a pillow or hell cut up that same pillow, just anything to distract yourself.

"I can’t do this, man. Almost every relationship I’ve had, platonic or romantic, has been me just being used as a tool. All except for one. Fucking. Person. And it’s taboo to be dating him because of his relation to my ex. 

My ex attempted to reach out a little while ago saying he didnt want us to be silent anymore, and I wanted us to work as friends. I really. Really did. That’s why I broke up with him. You can’t date your partner without being their friend too and he just wasn’t that. But obviously, that wasn’t going to happen. It wouldn’t and couldn’t work. Especially because after the “not wanting to be silent” text was lead up with how mad he was at me and how he couldn’t forgive me. 

So I re-blocked the number. It wasn’t healthy for him, to keep dancing around like this, it wasn’t healthy for me.

You can’t live a happy life without hurting people once in awhile. But that statement doesn’t stop the nightmares, the guilt, the internal gaslighting… I may be angry at how he treated me, like I was nothing but a little stuffed animal for him. Someone with no use other than being a snuggle toy and an emotional dumpster. But can I seriously blame him for being upset, even if I personally hadn’t been when it came to situations like this in the past? Everyone tells me this behavior is sexist, stems from the idea that I belong to that person. But like… is it??? 

I can’t stop having vivid nightmares ranging from metaphorical creepy bullshit like bugs pouring out of certain people’s eyes or something more literal like horrible events happening over and over. I can’t stop holding so much anger and anxiety and it just feels like I can’t control any of it anymore. All of my coping strategies have failed, and sometimes all I want to do is have the business end of a knife make sweet love to my insides or suffocate from the exhaust fumes from my car and make this nightmare of a mind stop draining me, and never have to confront my crippling financial issues and failing social life because I’m so desperate for a friend, family member, lover, anyone who doesnt see me as an 8 year old kid or an emotional dumpster or a fuck buddy or a failed clone of my parents who’s nothing but an irresponsible sack of shit. I’ve become so physically ill from this and work that im either too hungry or constantly about to throw up with muscles that are twitching and tensing every second. There are times where my skin and bones become hyper sensitive and I can just feel. Everything. Every ache every touch every- well everything. My eyebags are getting so bad that it just looks like I’ve been punched in the face- fuck it even feels like it. Not even makeup can hide it. It’s fucking miserable.

But no, I keep going because I can’t do that to the ones who are still here. So what the fuck am I supposed to do now? How. The fuck. Does one continue? When everything around you feels so fucking empty? What do I do to just make this goddamn meat prison agree with me and calm the fuck down? Relieve the guilt, relieve the pain and stress? I can’t exactly ask those around me for help, now can I? I mean, I can just imagine the horror on my current bf’s face if I dump all of this on him. The one perfect thing in my life, my best friend. I cant just do that to him."	biscuit_eater_	post	20.756847621315384	female	White	0.9988141059875488	na	na	na	3	selfharm
I'm so sorry you've been through all this. You deserve so much better and the way people have treated you doesn't define you whatsoever. It must have taken a lot of strength to cut contact with your ex and it was the right thing to do. Therapy could help you process your trauma, but not everyone can afford it or access it, and since you mentioned financial problems, I'm guessing it's not a possibility for you. I don't know if you have any mental health services that are free/covered by your insurance where you are. I'm thinking maybe you could benefit from meds too, some can at least help with sleep and relieve the nightmares a bit. I'm sure your current boyfriend cares about you and would want to support you through this. You can ask him if he's okay with you venting to him about your mental health. Most of the time, your loved ones will notice something's up anyway, and it's usually worse when they don't know what's going on with you.	biscuit_eater_	reply	na	na	na	0.9988141059875488	strong	no	no	na	selfharm

Finding things that work for you, both in terms of therapy and meds, is really exhausting. Especially when you don't have a lot of strength left to begin with. I'm currently looking for a new therapist too and even just getting that flicker of hope when there's a chance someone or something will finally help you and then losing it over and over when it doesn't is gut-wrenching.

"I'll start by saying that i pride myself off being a relatively good and smart student. But i hang out with a few of the loud, naughty kids so she automatically associated those traits with me.

  
 I swear since day 1, she HATED me for no reason. And i hate that I'm giving her so much thought. I remember when English used to be my favorite subject now whenever i walk in that classroom i feel forced to be completely different person. 

  
she makes rude comments and i don't think she realizes how much her words affect me.   
Shes told me that my laugh was weird and too loud. she's made fun of my accent (English isn't my first language) 

she asked the class a question, and no one answered so i muttered yes, and she told me that one day someone's going to beat me up because of my attitude.   
And that's just me, she can be much worse to some of my other classmates.

"FIRST AND FOREMOST: English is not my first language and I live in an English speaking country. Knowing that is relevant because every fucking immigrant has an accent and it doesn’t matter.

"My daughter has struggled with self harm. Based on comments I’ve over heard when visiting care givers I’m guessing she did see. I don’t think that’s a bad thing. 

I don’t know where you’re at with your SH or what your support network looks like, but I can tell you what I know from my daughter’s experience:

1. she says it was torture for her to constantly hide this secret and live in fear that someone would find out
2. she felt relief the morning I came into her bedroom to wake her up for breakfast and her arm was exposed and I saw. She didn’t cover up when she realized I saw—I think because it was such relief to finally not have to hide it
3. because I knew, she got the proper care she needed, including ER visits when she went deep
4. she didn’t think she had the strength to overcome this thing even while knowing it wasn’t sustainable

She hit 200 days clean yesterday. I’m so proud. If she relapsed tomorrow I would still be proud of her. It wouldn’t mean all her progress is erased. It would mean she’s gone longer than she has in two years. And we would keep fighting. I cannot comprehend how hard this challenge is for you but I’ve see first hand how hard it has been for my daughter. In so many moments telling me stopping would be impossible

It would be wrong to presume to know what you want or how you’re feeling. But if you are feeling alone in this thing. Lonely. Desperate. If it does feel impossible but you’d rather SH was not part of your life. Reaching out for help to those you trust can be empowering and also bring a much needed sense of relief and hope. You’d no longer feel like you’re on a secret island hoping passing boats don’t notice you. I know with compulsive/addictive behavior there can be a part of ourselves that doesn’t want help because we’re not ready to stop, but I hope you find the courage to reach out for support from those you trust. To believe in that future version of you that is two hours clean or two days clean or two weeks clean or two months clean or two years clean or two decades clean. Close your eyes and see it. Then (and sorry this is cheesy but it’s true) believe it. 

I’ve not walked in your shoes, but I have made admissions to loved ones that terrified me. Telling my parents I was getting divorced. Telling my parents I know longer believed in the religion they raised me in. Telling my daughter regrets I had. Sharing with her things I wished I had done differently. The things I’m most ashamed of. It can be terrifying. I was lucky that my admissions were met with an increase in love and understanding. The relief I felt was incredible. And suddenly I didn’t feel so alone. Suddenly it was as though I had permission to begin to truly love and accept myself. 

I know you’re scared. You don’t have to do this alone. I’m pulling for you. I admire you so much for the way you battle challenges I could never understand. These things don’t make you pathetic. Your beauty and worth transcends whatever struggles you have. We are all imperfect. We all give in to impulses we wish we would ignore. It makes us human. It makes you human. Nobody is as happy or as put together as they seem. Everybody has their shit. The hard part for you is your body is a testament to the world about your struggles, while, for example, the power obsessed megalomaniac that back stabs and plays office politics and crushes people to get ahead is publicly celebrated for their success and wealth, even while the demonic shit they struggle with that got them to where they are (which is infinitely worse than SH impulses) isn’t worn on their skin and obvious to the world. It isn’t fair or balanced but it’s the way it is. 

This community can support you from afar. And I and others will always be here to talk. But it’s hard to replace the doctors and friends and family in your life that could hold you and tell you how beautiful you are and support you in person if you would let them. Please let them. At a minimum, please tell a doctor or therapist about your SH.

Asking for help is beautiful and brave. You got this. You FUCKING GOT THIS.

Thank you for your kind words. I wish I could respond with as many or as eloquently, but I'm not good at it. Sometimes I wish someone would catch me, or see my cuts. It does feel crushing to have hide them all the time. Having to worry about holes in my clothes showing them all the time can be a lot sometimes. I wish I could tell my friend, but I don't want her to have to keep that secret, or feel like she betrayed me. My family would just blame themselves.

one-dimensional and ultimately more harmful than helpful.

But whenever I get down and think about doing it I get this like EXTREMELY overwhelming urge to cut my wrist. Sometimes I have to like almost restrain myself and lie on the floor hyperventilating in order to avoid doing it there. And then I do it on my thigh instead.

"I've somehow resisted avoiding self-harm completely (not thoughts + urges) for the past 2 weeks due to this very reason.. I always do it on my right arm (I'm a righty, but I still do it on my right hand with my left hand, cuz the first time I did it, I did it on my right hand without thinking and then I thought to myself, if I cut on my other hand also, then someone will inevitably notice the scars. I'm also taking it to the next level by trying to become left hand dominant.) But it has become a pain in the ass to try to hide it, and I HAVE NO FULL SLEEVES AT ALL FOR MY HOMEWEAR, EXCEPT MY ONE JACKET THAT MY PARENTS DON'T WANT ME TO WEAR IN HOT/NORMAL WEATHER. And I have to be very conscious of my right hand. My mom already noticed my cuts on my right hand and I came up with a very lame reason to cover it up (scratched myself with sharp and rough nails lol)

I've been clean for about 5 days now but i can't help looking at my cuts in absolute disgust. It feels right in the moment when im angry and i always resort to self harming because it's the only way i can soothe myself but when i see the blood it always makes me cringe and regret it. I just feel so guilty after doing it because it'll be a constant reminder on my skin on how I can't cope properly. Even healed scars from 3 years ago make me feel sick because it brings back the memories and why i did it which is usually because of an argument. I wish i could stop but it's the only thing that can make me feel better and the only true way i can prevent it is if there's no sharp things around me which makes me feel so pathetic, why can't i just control what i do?? I wish I could've found a better way sooner because now i have random scars everywhere on my arms, legs and hands and it's awful because people always ask me what it is. It's gotten so bad because 3 years ago the school told my mum, and that encounter made me self harm more. I may sound sensitive but that situation really messed me up for a while because i knew all safeguarding teachers knew what had happened. I knew people were staring at me. I knew i had been caught and that there was no point trying to hide it again. I know this is a long rant but I can't handle it anymore i need advice on what else to do rather than self harm each time i get mad...	miresao	post	9.589595217226092	female	White	0.9945512413978577	na	na	na	1	selfharm

My boss know I have a self-harm issue. She and my coworkers see my existing scars every day because they're healed. But I tend to relapse a lot and so I'll show up with bandages repeatedly. I know that they all know what it is but I wonder if they can fire me for it? I never show open wounds but I think just because they know, it's a bit..awkward. So, can they fire me for it? So far they've all been respectful of my scars aside from 2 people who asked me straight out if it's self-harm but I wonder if this kind of acceptance would change if I keep turning up with new bandages every once in a while?

It’s heavily dependent on where you live. In the US, basically all states have at-will employment laws meaning you can be fired for pretty much any reason at any point in time. It’s unlikely they’d fire you specifically for self harm, they’d probably make up some other reason, but it is a risk and something to be aware of unfortunately.

"Where do you live? I live in TX & I learned a trick (I have 8 older brothers who constantly injure themselves) 

And I’ll go to the Dollar Store & get the cheap bottles rhere… rhe big white tabs. lol you can do almsot anything with these cures headache lol. 

I have a pill crusher & get it super fine & then I mix it with Neosporin & sometimes a few other things & it makes like a paste & I cover it & wrap the entire thing so it’s not coming off or coming out. 

And that completely changed things for me… it helps where it doesn’t burn or itch & it makes mine go away SOOOO much faster! If it isn’t too deep sometimes overnight. 

I put it on before it starts to get a scab & also I sanitize the RB & also my skin before & after. 

I know that might not help with your boss thing… but that really helped me heal things & they were as painful as well. But maybe that can hel with helping your things heal where people can see them. 

You can also use like liquid Band-Aid or sometimes I use clear nail Polish (that second one burns) & let it dry & then I can use a full coverage foundation that covers the entire thing up. 

Or you could pretend like you just got a new cat or dog…. I actually did just get a new puppy & my arms from him look like my legs. 

Or you could bite the bullet & go talk to your boss & say you make habe noticed my scars & tell them you’re starting therapy. You don’t legally have to tell them why or anything about your heath (depending on where you live). Make sure they think it’s bc of something traumtic & that you don’t have any kind of mental diagnosis (even if you) so they can’t use that as a reason to fire you. 
****Record this entire conversation or anytime someone talks about it or take photos & videos of others talking about it 
And depending on how it goes say how much you like working there & making your job a priority is the reason why you’re getting help. 
And maybe could ask about your job preformance only if you know irs going to be good.

"Hello, I hope it's okay if I ask this here. A friend of mine (A) texted me saying that another friend (B) was cutting himself in the class. I wasn't in the school so I couldn't do much outside telling (A) to tell the teacher or to directly talk to (B) to know if he could help. At the end, (A) didn't do anything in the moment but when (B) stopped, he talked about a different topic until the class ended. Then he texted our teacher to tell what happened, and the teacher said the school's psychologist will talk to my friend.

I'm not sure what's the proper thing to do. I panicked and told my friend to inform the teacher, but I'm not sure if it's really okay. I haven't talk to (B) yet because he doesn't know (A) told me, and I don't even know if he noticed that (A) was watching. What should I do if the situation happens again?

you did the  right thing, if your friend B was cutting in class it sounds like he may have been doing it for attention. And I know that sounds like something old grumps would say but it’s true. I have done things like that in the past and they were cries for help! B might be upset with you for telling the teachers but in the long run you helped big time.

I’ve actually been one of those kids cutting in class before. And while my reasons for cutting are a completely different reason for the majority of people who cut, the same reaction kind of applies. I obviously don’t know what that kid is going through or why he did it but from my experience and from others I’ve helped, having someone they can trust(a friend or adult they’re close with) is the best option before ever going to a more formal adult like a teacher. While it is completely the correct decision to get a psychologist involved it is always good to check with the person harming themselves before they get thrown into all the bs that comes with teachers finding out and then eventually seeing a psychologist. A lot of people struggling have a lot of trouble trusting people and even wanting to get help in the first place, and being forced into trusting adults they barely know like teachers and then being forced to go see a school psychologist for their safety might make whatever healing process they have ahead a lot harder. I’m not saying this applies to everyone for all we know wanting someone to tell the teacher is what that kid could’ve wanted everyones different and I’m not saying you made the wrong decision it was technically the right one and you meant the best for him. This is just my input based on personal experience and everything I’ve seen both in and out of school with people. Like for me and all the other people I’ve known the attention I was seeking(even tho that wasn’t the main goal) was from my fellow classmates NOT any of the staff in the building and I was pretty frustrated and embarrassed when the teacher found out, not blaming anyone or anything, and other people I knew kind of had the same attitude towards this as like I said before trust is a huge problem and a lot of the times it’s more like they’d rather not get help which is obviously not the case deep down, but comfort zones and boundaries are a massive part of mental health and they are very delicate.	salsasoya	reply	na	na	na	0.9558970928192139	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
"Well, I personally think it’s better to check in with the kid yourself first, but I ain’t exactly good at understanding humans. I believe this because they might have parents/guardians that discriminate against those who self harm.

It happens quite often, and when it does, it’s actually much better not to inform them. This is because discrimination against their bad mental health and harmful way of dealing with it can even evoke suicidal desires.

you did the right thing.  I did that once...cut in class.  I used a razor and cut too deep.  I got up and rushed out of the class to try and stop it.  I went back when I washed it and got some paper towel but after a minute or 2 sitting back in the room, it just kept bleeding and I got so freaked out.  then I remember sitting on the floor in the hallway with my friend next to me.  I eventually laid my head in her lap cause I was tired.  my friend was there for me but there's a little part of me that wishes she had taken that razor from me BEFORE I cut myself.  I don't blame her at all.  I should have been smarter not to do what I did when I did.  and when I walked out of the room the 2nd time, she didn't keep it to herself.  she spoke up and said what happened.  so I ended up being taken to psych (which I of course lied my way out of).

your best bet is a long sleeve swimsuit, and/or a long swim skirt/swim trunks, say you want to be more modest or you don’t want to get sunburnt, or you just wanted to try a new kind of swimsuit. a wetsuit would work too, say you don’t want to get cold. 

also just throwing out the idea of faking sick (headache/stomach ache will work well,) so you could avoid the risk all together, it’s up to you though, going to the water park could help you with your mental health via exercise (swimming), social interactions and just being at a fun place in general."	1999IbishuCovet	reply	na	na	na	0.9980427026748657	no	no	no	na	selfharm

"Recently my mum bought bio oil and is trying to get me to use it. I can’t even regularly brush my teeth or shower, and she says I have to do it twice a day for 3 months? I don’t even WANT to. I want to keep my scars. She’s told me that it’s embarrassing for her and that she doesn’t want me to have them because it makes her look like a bad parents and “embarrasses” our family.

My arms, hands, legs, thighs, etc are covered in scars and recently she’s been saying that I need to “cover up” in public and when I complain that it’s hot (it’s been like 30-40 degrees recently) she says I “shouldn’t have done it in the first place”. No shit, it’s a shitty coping mechanism but I wasn’t taught anything better and now here I am.

She thinks I haven’t been cutting for around 4-7 months, but I’ve been doing it almost every day with some exceptions (but now I do it on my forearms instead of anywhere else). She used to threaten me with the psyche ward (ex: “I’ll take you to the fucking hospital if you don’t stop and they’ll force you to”), I can’t talk to her about anything because she’ll use it against me and all around i’m just not sure what to do anymore about the bio oil situation.

My scars are the only thing I have close enough to comfort me, they’re a reminder of all the bad days I’ve had and when they heal THEMSELVES it makes me think about how bad days will be temporary and how I can push through it without anybody nagging me. I don’t want to use oil to heal them and yet she reminds me every day and makes sure I say I have been using it even though I haven’t."	tadpolechild	post	38.56832556558412	male	White	0.9968494772911072	na	na	na	1	selfharm

The things she says to you are not ok. She’s making this situation about her when it isn’t at all. Your self harm, your scars and your pain are not an embarrassing thing. It’s very wrong of her to make it about your family’s image. It isn’t about them. She is also clearly uneducated about self harm.

Hi everyone, I have noticed recently that my cuts bleed for a much longer time than they used to... my blood doesn't clot effectively anymore, making me lose quite a bit of blood relative to the size of the cut. I'm wondering if this may have been caused from past blood loss. Recently I have purposely been cutting veins and have lost a lot of blood... I've luckily been able to stop myself from doing that, but I wonder if that blood loss has caused a lack of effective clotting? I'm trying my best to take a break to replenish my blood... should I try even harder to take a long break from self harm to get my blood back and then take a trip to the doctor if the lack of clotting persists after that?	enemypenguinz	post	21.005057085053828	male	White	0.9956207871437073	na	na	na	2	selfharm

Could you maybe swim in a T-shirt? Lots of people have body image issues or don't like to wear swimsuits, others don't really tend to think much of it. Keeping a towel around you when you're not in the water can work, but your shoulders will still be pretty visible when swimming, so I don't know. Be careful with fresh or healing cuts though, you're not really supposed to swim with open wounds, so make sure to clean them afterwards. You could wear a waterproof band-aid, but I guess most people don't have those lying around and I don't know if you can get any.

"SH (TRIGGER WARNING)

I 12/13F at the time was self harming due to sa incidents with my step-father (not the story). I was really ill with an undiagnoed kidney infection so my mother 38/39F at the time booked me a doctors appointment to get blood taken. The night before i was on tiktok and youtube searching how to hide fresh sh cuts. I had a panic attack that night worried about her reaction. The next morning, i changed and my mother was putting numbing cream on my right arm first. I was glad. But when she finished i froze and looked down asking if i can do the other arm (for obvious reasons) but she refused and rolled up my sleeve...

I started to awl my eyes out while pushing her of me, kicking and screaming. I ran into the kitchen and hid in the corner still trying to fight off her tight grip on my arm. ""WHO TOUCHED YOU?"" she screamed. ""Dad did"" i replied and explained her the innoprprate touching, looks and comments. My mother calmed me down. ""I dont think he ment any of it y'know"" she said like i wasted her time ""its his first time being a father and to 8 children it must be hard. He was just trying to be FATHERLY."". As a 27M thats the best fartherly thing he can do- pathetic.
'Fatherly'... everytime i hear the word i get a flash of the memories. We walked to the doctors in silence. No one talked. When we got there. I closed my eyes when i could fell the nurse taking blood. She didnt utter a word but kept giving me digusted stares at my arm.

This is not the only horrible comments of my mum and incidents with my step-dad i got if you want more stories i dont mind telling you.

"I was clean for 4 months, 4 months were I resisted the urge to cut, I hate the fact that after all I just gave in.

I'm going to Therapy, I'm (kinda) doing good in school, I was just feeling a little bit better and I feel so dumb, I feel useless, I couldn't even get myself to bleed. I used to be able to, I don't even remember how, I was able to do some scratches with a blade, I don't thinks that's worth it, I genuinely feel like I need to absolutely obliterate the living shit out of my arm, but a part of my brain is stopping me, my arm burns, yes, but is not enough.

I'm so out of my mind rn, I'm numb and really, really disassociated, I don't feel anything at all, I wouldn't mind having a full blown panic attack so I could feel something more that sorrow and fucking emptiness, I know I need help, I was sure I could get it, now I don't know if I can.

Hi OP, so sorry to hear that you’ve been going through this. I know what it feels like to be so fucking empty that you need to cut to feel something, and I know that just being told of your worth and strength don’t really help. But I really do believe that you can make your next clean streak last longer. This isn’t the end of your journey OP, it doesn’t mean you failed. It’s just a setback, one that I know you’ll recover from. I hope that you do whatever it is you do to distract yourself. It sounds like you’re doing better otherwise, so don’t let this make you forget your progress.

Well, it's a coping mechanism so it's used to cope with negative emotions temporarily.

"I've reached a point in my recovery where it's been so long since I've selfharmed that my scars are fading. Even my worst ones. I'm only about to be 17, but I've dealt with selfharm since I was 12. I'm happy to say I've been clean for over a year, mostly thanks to my girlfriend.

But with recovery comes some strange thoughts and feelings, I've learned. There's times I feel like I might relapse. And there's times I wish I never started. But for the most part, I've accepted that selfharm has hugely impacted my life and there's nothing I can change about the past. 

A feeling I have started to experience recently is a strong attachment to my fading scars. Over the years I've accepted them as part of my body. Sometimes I think about the beauty of them in that I've recovered and they're not fresh cuts anymore. But they're starting to fade and I feel like in part, a piece of my personal history is fading away too. 

I'm a little afraid for the day I can no longer easily see my scars. I'm unsure of the feelings I'll have. I'm slowly losing a huge part of myself. And that is scary."	slvdg3	post	22.636935475475877	male	White	0.0062792678363621235	na	na	na	1	selfharm
First of all, congratulations on your clean streak! It sounds to me that you've reached a very mature and healthy mindset towards your past. Letting go of the things that connect you to it is a logical part of recovery, but it can bring out all kinds of feelings and change is scary. It's okay to feel whatever you're going to feel. I know for a lot of us, scars are like proof of the mental pain we've been through, but them fading doesn't actually take these experiences away. Everything that has happened will still have happened when your scars are less visible. Even if you'll get a lot of negative emotions associated with it and you'll be struggling really badly, I'm sure you'll get through it and eventually the positive emotions will overpower them. You might still miss your scars in a way, but you'll be able to look back without wanting to add new wounds. You'll always be valid no matter what.	slvdg3	reply	na	na	na	0.0062792678363621235	weak	no	no	na	selfharm

"Today is officially my one year ‘birthday’ on HRT. I was hoping for a something calm and stress free, maybe make something to commemorate the date and give myself a ‘birthday’ gift. I’ve made it so far, I wanted to celebrate. I haven’t done such a thing and likely won’t.

My roommate and fairly close friend for almost ten years got very drunk last night and was very affectionate. She talked about a lot of personal stuff and about our relationship. I don’t want to get into details. She talked about the future, and where we would go in life, what we would do. She spoke to me with nothing but love and affection. And yet, it sent me into a spiral.

I can’t love her how she loves me, I can’t trust her how she deserves. I see her as a deity and I fear and love her, but not so much that I could be as close to her as she wants me to be. I felt so guilty, so gross. If I can’t accept love in its purest form, I don’t deserve any at all. I couldn’t say anything about it. I’ve never been able to speak my mind. Even through my years of adulthood, I haven’t gained the willpower to say anything I wanted. It’s pathetic.

So I’ve been stuck today, thinking about my place in the world and the idea of a future, about my friend and if I’ll ever let myself out of these chains I let everyone put on me. Why can’t I speak?

I have been considering hurting myself all day. I want to feel so much pain I cry for the first time in too long. I want to rip my skin off and throw it far away, I want to cut myself open and watch the blood seep from my wounds and paint me red. I want to hurt until I can’t think of anything but the pain.

That’s the only birthday gift I want at this point."	Golden_Scene	post	18.776330402606348	female	White	0.9983574748039246	na	na	na	1	selfharm

I know it feels like sh-ing is the only way to stop the constant thoughts of pain. There are sometimes better ways to help these thoughts stop, maybe try squeezing a stress toy.

first time was an intentional paper cut when i was about 5/6, scratched until i bled at 7. got serious when i was 12 (started to cut and burn - some quite deep and prob should have gone to the hospital but don’t want to get in trouble), my parents found out when we were at my granny’s house, i was sent to the spare room and each female family member (aunt, granny, mammy) came in one by one and asked me about it, i tried lying, saying i got pushed into a wall at school but they didn’t believe me, it was clear to me that they thought i was super weird and weak. once we got home to our house my parents shouted at me, told me i’d end up killing myself, and told me about every single person they knew that committed suicide. my mum kept saying what would people think? if i’m not worth my parents helping me through that then i’m obviously deserving of cutting. my mum said the worst thing - she said she tried to cut herself to see why i did it. ironically the whole affair made me want to cut more. since that day neither of my parents have asked me if i stopped or not and i’m 21 now.	clownperson73	post	8.44580522951117	female	White	0.9820231795310974	na	na	na	2	selfharm

that must have been a really difficult experience for you. you were just a child who was struggling with their mental health, and it sounds like your parents weren't supportive. it wasn't weak or weird for you to hurt yourself, you were just trying to get through something tough the best way you knew how to. however, i don’t know your parents, but it does seem like they’re worried about you and want to keep you safe. they definitely didn’t react in a helpful way though. i get that you might feel alone, but if it helps, you’re not the only person who feels this way. it’s not weird or unusual. a lot of us on here feel the same, myself included. so you’re not alone that way. :) trust me when i say this, you do not deserve any of this pain. especially when you were so young darling, you have clearly been through so much. i really hope your life starts looking up. you are worthy of love and happiness.	clownperson73	reply	na	na	na	0.9820231795310974	weak	no	strong	na	selfharm
"TLDR: Family said that it hurts them when I hurt myself, but I find it funny since they (mostly my dad) have done things to hurt me 

______

 

My family knows about my self-harm (I started to have medical issues so pretty much had to tell them). At some point, they told me “it hurts us when you hurt yourself.” I find it pretty ironic, considering that my dad regularly screams at me and flies into rages (yelling, cussing, blaming someone [half the time it’s me] for whatever he’s frustrated about, saying things just to hurt people, etc). Sometimes this results in physical violence. I would get spanked so much as a kid (not just a quick swat w/ an open palm) and would occasionally get the switch (it’s basically a tree branch). Now this is not so common since I have started returning the favor (iykwim) anytime someone lays so much as a finger on me without my consent, but he’s started occasionally pinning me down for no reason. Ik it’s not a safety thing because he started the pinning me down thing before knowing that I sh, and I’m not violent towards others unless they do something to me first. Then I might do something in self-defense


I’m not perfect tho. I have absolutely yelled at people before. Mostly my parents, when they yelled at me first, but I’ve had my moments of getting angry for no real reason

So anyways…Most of my relationship with my dad involves unpleasant memories, negative thoughts/feelings, and behavior that is questionable at best  

He used fear and control tactics (including things that caused me both physical and emotional pain)  to get his child to show “respect” (it did not work), and my mom does not act like that but is guilty of tolerating it for literal decades and occasionally defending him, yet it somehow hurts my parents whenever I hurt myself?

Why does it hurt them so much? Is it because I’m the one doing it and they don’t have much control of that part?"	creatingaus3rname	post	18.92332444869199	male	White	0.9959657192230225	na	na	na	1	selfharm
i have near enough the same exact situation with my dad and tbh sometimes i cant even bare to be in the same room as him. my parents found out that i self harmed luckily only twice, mother being more supportive but my dad completely overlooking how i feel and calling me retarded, threatening to put me in a psych ward, for this shit. im sorta ok with my dad now but i think why he would get hurt is all to do with the fact that in the older generation of men, this type of stuff and mostly anything to do with mental health was overlooked completely and i feel like most dads wont have the first idea how to react, just like mine. stupid threats and insults to get you to stop and it never does but i guess that it was just my dads way of trying 🤷‍♂️	creatingaus3rname	reply	na	na	na	0.9959657192230225	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

not sure if this is the right place to post, but i (14F) have struggled with self harm + other depression related things for around four years now, and over the last 5 months i’ve been clean. everyone around me seems to think because i’m clean, im mentally well. this has not been and isn’t the case at all, and last night i relapsed. i feel myself slipping back into the habit of hurting myself again, but i feel like, being “better”, my struggles would be seen as a beg for attention or wouldn’t be taken seriously. i was just wondering what people would suggest i do- the only way im able to contact camhs and/or my psychiatrist is through my mum, but i don’t want my mental state to become an inconvenience again. same goes for the rest of my family. my friends don’t really understand, nor is there much they can do. i need professional help. i just don’t know what to do anymore	999miamii	post	28.340473479009102	male	White	0.9979149699211121	na	na	na	1	selfharm

Basically sexting with one of my fwbs (this one is pretty bdsm), I cut my boobs in front of the camera for him. Also scratched my nipples with the same blade, and used a lighter on my boobs too. For the sexual enjoyment for them.

This is a really tight subjective since it's between sh and bdsm,  cam go really far in the harming sense. So i guess it only depend on why you do it, if it's has a coping thing then you shouldn't but if it is a a pleasure then maybe try talking it out with your dom( a spécialy since you seem to question what you done)  so that you know you re limits and feel conftable with him so that you still take pleasure in it, as a dom he should understand and priorities your need first	Mermaid_Tuna_Lol	reply	na	na	na	0.9957917928695679	weak	no	no	na	selfharm

Clean it frequently (saline or water with mild soap), keep it covered and change the dressing at least once a day, use Neosporin if needed and protect it from sunlight even after it heals. If you do get an infection, an antibiotic ointment might not be enough to treat it, so in that case, you should prioritize your safety and get medical attention no matter what.	kxttxnisgay	reply	na	na	na	0.9973528385162354	no	no	no	na	selfharm

We drove back and when I woke up he sat kn my side and asked me about my scars. I didn’t want to talk to him because first of all he is the last person I would like to talk to about it because I like him. Secondly I just can’t vent to someone who knows my family!! 

I told him that I don’t want to talk about it and he told me that I could either talk to him or he would go to his father. Side note his father is a psychologist and really close with my family. So him knowing would lead to involving him into my family business which I CERTAINLY DONT WANT TO.

"I'm so tired

I'm only 16. I have bipolar, adhd, most likely autism (not self diagnosed, from the words of my doctor as they're gonna do more testing), panic disorder, anxiety, depression, possible BPD, anorexia and emetophobia. I'm so tired of everything. Every day is the same. I wake up, lay in bed, watch TV, smoke weed and sometimes drink to escape from shit, argue with my family, cook, then play video games and go to sleep
For a while, video games, art, rollerblading and other stuff I love were an escape but it's been over a year and nothing had changed. I'm a stupid dropout who has no friends except my neighbors who I don't think even like me anymore, my girlfriend, and 1 friend from elementary who lives 2-3 hours away. I'm so tired of everything being the same. Just laying here and soaking in everything that's wrong with my life. 
My dad left when I was 14ish and before that he never treated me right which is the root of most of my mental problems. We can't afford therapy and all the therapists that take our insurance are assholes. We're broke. We can't even afford new shoes or clothes. Only food and our dog and cat, which of who are both one of my only lifelines along with my girlfriend and little sister. 
I'm also the therapy friend to my only few friends and girlfriend, which I'm glad to be, but I hate trying to talk them out of suicide and make all their problems my own when they have no idea how bad everything is getting. I don't mean to sound selfish, I really don't. I love them so much and would do anything to keep them alive, it's just that it's so hard to fucking deal with. We can't even afford meds for me. 
I wanna go out with people, but I'm scared. I wanna enjoy delicious food, but I'm scared. I'm obsessed with food videos and cooking but maybe that's just because I'm always so hungry. I wanna have a teenage life, but I'm a dropout with barley any friends. 
My best friend, aka my neighbor who's like my twin sister (as we're exactly a month apart and have had multiple conjoined birthday parties in between our birthdays) recently got a girlfriend and I don't think she cares about me anymore. She was my lifeline for so long, the only reason I stayed alive just so I could see her every night. But then we got in a huge fight all because my emetophobia (intense fear of vomit) and eating disorder caused by that mixed with anorexia were being stupid one day. We got over it and are still best friends but since then nothing has been the same. We haven't hung out as much, been as close, bonded and laughed about stupid things every night, etc. She loves her girlfriend now. And I don't blame her. I love my girlfriend too, more than life itself, but I just want my best friend back. My other best friend lives so far from me and I never ever see her and I fucking miss her. But since I have this stupid fucking phobia and so many other issues, I'm scared for her to come over. Whenever she comes into town she spends the night and we have so much fun but I can't do that now. 
My girlfriend has other friends and people to care about (and she's allowed to, I'm not controlling at all) but I don't think she sees how much I need her right now. I mean she's not a fucking stupid ass dropout like me. She has a social life and things that she's excited about even when she's having hard times and can't be with her friends. Don't get me wrong, she's been through so much bullshit and I feel so bad and am always there for her. I love her. I just don't love myself. I don't love my life. I don't love where I am. I'm so done. I wanna die so bad but I'm so scared to leave my girlfriend (as she just lost her best friend and I don't want her to kill herself because i did) and my pets who I love more than anything. My beautiful dog who's saved me through almost everything I've been through, and my amazing cat who I found on the streets starving and saved her life. 
I'm just so sick and tired of living. I wanna die. But at the same time I just want my life to be happier. More exciting. A teenage life like everyone I know has. I was gonna kill myself on June 18th but my girlfriend saved my life before the date even came.
But idk now. I'm so tired. I'm tired of not having friends, I'm tired of everything. 
I don't wanna leave my little sister alone, I don't wanna leave my pets or my girlfriend but I just don't know how much longer I can take that pain. I wanna die. Help."	someoneunknown___	post	15.786628397664124	male	White	0.998616099357605	na	na	na	8	selfharm

"Self harm isn't something I've been super open about over the years, but... it's something I've always struggled with. From an age too young to understand what it really was, to an age too old to have an excuse, I've got too many scars from too many years of struggle. Tomorrow, I go to begin covering them up with tattoos, artwork that represents things that have helped me through those dark times.

I haven't been focusing on time spent ""clean"" like many do, mostly because it's not something I feel like will ever leave me, not completely.  Even today I still feel the itch. I find other ways to hurt myself, if I'm honest, ways that don't leave scars. I feel like that's progress though. Besides, Harry will always have his scar, Frodo carried the burden of the ring with him long after it was thrown into Mount Doom. Trauma never completely goes away, right? That being said, I hope this is the start of a new chapter for me. One where I don't have to feel scared exposing my arms in public, or cringe at photos of myself in anything sleeveless. Where I don't see peoples eyes flitting to my arm as we speak if they're exposed, leaving me to worry about what they think of me. Even though people are more open minded about that stuff now, it's something I'm always conscious of, and I'm happy to finally have something else for myself and other people to look at instead. 

Part of me is excited, so SO fricking excited. The art (what i've seen so far) is incredible, the artist I picked is super fricking talented and I'm in love with his style, I can't think of anyone better to put their art on me forever (lol). And, part of me is hopeful that this will put more of a stop to the itch to carry on. I don't know much about addiction, for I'm certain self harm classifies as one, but I know the itch won't go away, not completely, so I've got to do what I can to push it aside, ignore it etc. and I hope this will help that.

But, part of me is is also sad. I think i'm going to miss the scars... I know they won't ever be completely gone, that they'll still be there (especially the bigger/deeper ones), but seeing my arms as they are.. I feel like it's such a huge part of my past, my struggles... at risk of sounding morbid, I... spent so long building my collection, it feels a shame just... paving over the mosaic of my troubled life, so to speak. God that was dramatic ahah, sorry. I don't know what I'm trying to say, I just am scared to end that chapter, I think. 

Ramble aside... Tomorrow is going to be an adventure, a sad, nervewrecking, hopeful adventure. The start of a new chapter... Wish me luck?

Long story short: I relapsed tonight after hearing my dad say he’s going to kick me out of the house if I can’t function like an actual human. I ran out of places on my thighs and started doing it on my arm, then I realized. I’m doing it on my arm. I’m active most of the day because my work requires me to be (Come on, they make me wear business casual in 95 degree Fahrenheit temperatures) and I have to dress as light as possible. Is there any effective way to hide the cuts I made, or should I just say some dumbass excuse like “the cat did it” despite it looking like a whole gang of cats went after my arms?

It dosent work that well but if the cuts are scabbing I would sometimes cover them with skin tone make up and it works if they are not supper close to your personal space, sometimes bandaids are less conspicuous than bandages and less noticeable I definitely don’t recommend the make up one of the cuts are not healing or scabbing at least that’s a very fast way to get an infection	HamsungTM	reply	na	na	na	0.9985587000846863	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
"For context I've been struggling with self harm for around 2 years now. I'll get clean for a few months than relapse again. I've learned to ask for help and such from my support system but at this point it just feels like giving up. I'm not sure how to ask for help or advice anymore since I know I'll end up relapsing again or I feel as if they'll get annoyed. The last time I reached out for help from my therapist she told me that it wasn't ""bad enough"" and that i should just be able to stop it. I'm geniuely not sure if I should even ask for help or how to ask for help.

I dont know how I can help him properly because I never received that support when I struggled with self harm and websites give me really obvious advice that I do already, Im clean 3 years from self harm but it was never my choice and my parents forced me to quit by stripping my room and punishing me until I stopped so I dont know how to go about help someone one quit.

"TLDR: Find and treat the underlying cause(s) and not just the self-harm itself, use alternatives instead of self-harm (in order to reduce or eliminate the physical harm that you experience from this coping mechanism), and find something that makes you want to stop harming yourself (it can be as meaningful or as silly as you want, as long as it works for you)

_______




Different things work for different people so take this with a grain of salt, but here’s what works (most of the time) for me: 



• I realized that I was never going to stop engaging in self-destructive behavior until I addressed the things that were causing me to do that in the first place. I stopped cutting myself at one point (back on my bs tho), and during the time that I had stopped I just replaced it with other almost equally unhealthy coping mechanisms. This is because I was just trying to treat the self-harm problem and not any of the underlying causes that led to me engaging in such behavior. I still need to work on this one myself, but someone once told me that you can’t just stop your self-harm problem-you actually have to heal from the thing(s) that caused it to start or else you’ll just pick up a new unhealthy coping mechanism or addiction 


• I used some alternatives! You may have to try multiple different ones before you find something that works for you, but I found some alternatives that I could use whenever I felt like cutting myself. The alternatives won’t address the underlying issues, but they can help to reduce or eliminate the physical harm that you feel whenever you are self-harming 

• None of the above stuff is going to work if you don’t want it to. Try finding some reasons to recover/motivation to stay clean. It can be something meaningful (friends, family, etc), something practical (self harm is expensive…wouldn’t you rather spend the money on something that’s actually worthwhile?), something silly (my current motivation is that I have an upcoming clean streak on my birthday), or even something about the negatives of sh (sh puts you at a higher risk for infections and all sorts of other nasty stuff that you don’t want). Your motivation/reasons to recover can be absolutely anything tho, not just the stuff that I said!"	totalshitty	reply	na	na	na	0.9961768388748169	no	no	no	na	selfharm

"More specifically, 3/4 sleeves. Time and time again, I find myself looking at vintage blouses/tops with 3/4 sleeves that are really nice...then get very conscious about all the SH scars on my lower arms. Where I live it's cold enough that no one is going to find it strange you wear long sleeves for 10,5-11,5 months pr. year. When it's too hot for that, hardly anyone judges me for wearing a t-shirt or 1/2sleeve blouse. But 3/4 sleeves...just can't get the thought out of my head that other people must think I'd wear that to ""show off"" sh scars (My lower arms are, like, deformed by self harm, there is no way to not notice)

"i love 3/4 sleeves too, they’re beautiful. wear what you want to wear, life is too short to care what other people think. i understand it can feel uncomfortable though. 

honestly, if anybody does think you’re showing off, it doesn’t matter. they probably aren’t that educated on self harm, they don’t really think about how permanent scars are. i don’t know why some people expect sh scars to be covered at all times. it’s ridiculous.

even if you were showing them off, who cares. the scars are a part of your body sweetheart, you can’t remove them, so i say just go for it! plus dressing up is super fun. i bet wearing long sleeves all the time can get boring.

You should try finding a coping method. Do something that you enjoy, or makes you happy. If that doesn’t work, talk to someone about it, like a therapist or social worker.

So I’m planning how to hide it bc my parents don’t expect me to wear long sleeves, ever. So since we moved out here(much colder than where we used to live) I haven’t had a full winter here yet(I moved back in with them last December) I think I can get away with saying that it’s a lot colder here than it was in our old state, so I can wear hoodies for the majority of the winter. And if I get a job that I need short sleeves for I am planning on wearing my arm sleeve that I got when I tried to kill myself in 2020 under my shirt so it hides them. And then hiding the sleeve when I get home and get into my onesies that are all long-sleeved.


So essentially, onesies while I’m home, hoodies when I have to go out, and sleeve when I work. Sounds like a solid plan to me.

So my point is, are there any other ways of covering up scars besides long sleeves? Like, maybe sharpie drawings or maybe even henna?

"You’ll generally admit yourself through the ER and tell them you’re having a mental health crisis. If you’re admitted for an inpatient stay you might end up waiting in the ER for anywhere from a few hours to a week (or more) for a bed to open up. 

Different units have different protocols- for short term stays you might not do schoolwork, but some units have a dedicated classroom and teachers to help you keep up. If you’re a minor there’s a good chance you won’t be allowed contact with friends, but that varies by unit too. Whenever I was admitted as a minor I could only call my parents, and I could only use the phone at the nurse’s station so they knew who I was contacting.

You can go directly to a psychiatric hospital to be admitted. You may want to call ahead to see what their protocol is, if they have openings, take your insurance, what you can and can't bring, etc. I've been 5 times, although only once as a minor, and that was the time I went through the ER. They have specific phone times and they will monitor your calls, but you can call whoever you have a number for, in my experience. They just can't call back unless they have a code or password, usually. Short term stays usually want you to focus on your mental health, so you catch up on school when you get out, but long term stays will usually allow you to do school work, or may even have classes. Usually, they will have a lot of group therapy sessions, which are optional, but attending shows you want the help and gets you out faster. You'll also see a psychiatrist. You may also see other specialists, or a therapist one on one. Feel free to message me if you have more questions.	mentallyillkitty	reply	na	na	na	0.9945247173309326	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

"Hi 20 Male here, 
Please pardon my not so grammatically correct english as its not my first language. 
Also this is my first post in this subreddit, so I apologize if i break any rules in advance. 

As the title suggest, this has been the first time I cut my skin deep enough to cause a bit blood to seep out which caused me to kinda realize the depth of the whole situation and stop and contemplate the whole thing. 

I have been somewhat into self harm from a really long time. I mean I ain't sure if that counts as self harm but I remember my very first self harm like attempts from when I was 9. I know sounds really far fetched but I remember after getting bullied a lot I used to take my pencil and just jab into the back side of my fist in my class till it hurted beyond what I can tolerate and stop. I mean i remember after that I did that thing on several occasions 

And I think I grew up in a house which I don't think you would call healthy for anyone's mental well being, I mean atleast thats what my friend said after I shared some of my past stuff with him. 

Well the point I want to make is that I had been doing that shit almost throughout my whole school life to just calm down or you know get back to my senses while I was bullied. But this is the first time I bled due to this.

I just don't know what or how should I react to this?

"Is there one that shows how long I’ve been clean for and can give me motivation not to relapse?

I’ve been self-harming for a few months now and I feel like my depression is finally starting to get better. I feel like I can take a step forward and try not to self harm anymore.

Sorry if this is a stupid question, ’m new to this. I’ve never self harmed before I started a few months ago so I’ve no idea where to begin in trying to stop."	Zoinkawa	post	16.866326857277308	male	White	0.9898781776428223	na	na	na	5	selfharm

try and find the big square bandaids! the best solution is to stop all together but if you can’t, take care of them as best as you can. make sure you put antibacterial ointment on them especially the deeper ones. make sure you change the bandages atleast twice a day just for extra cleanliness. you matter so much and you are so loved❤️	Paws_with_Quads	reply	na	na	na	0.9951618313789368	no	no	no	na	selfharm
"gauze pads and tape are the most versatile, but sometimes the location can be tricky to tape well.

"Hi, 

I have a fresh wound; a mere day old. It’s quite deep, I believe I cut into the fat layer. Now, I’m looking for advice.

I’m going to a club tomorrow night. The issue is that I’m not sure how to cover the cut subtly, due to it being so fresh. I put plasters on it but they gave me a huge, itchy, red rash. Now it looks even more intense. I don’t think I’ll be bringing a jacket because I get too hot. However, I really don’t want to draw attention to my arm and ultimately my fresh wound. Is there anything subtle & effective I can do?

Words of wisdom will be greatly appreciated.

But if you stop you'll never have to worrry about covering it. But that's easier said that done. I bandaided my feelings with drugs and alcohol for years. You'll get tired of hurting yourself.

I'm wondering if this is because of the fabric plasters because the clear ones never gave me a rash or anything. The area is still not hot to the touch and doesn't hurt anymore. It's just a rash around my cuts in the shape of the plasters. I doubt it's an infection as i have literally no symptoms of one.

Since it’s a young child, maybe sway the subject into a different direction? It may not be best to fully explain it someone that young.

Something that I did with my siblings, and for other kids that would notice, is I told them I got into a fight with a tiger and I won. I got the most wholesome reactions out of using that response, a lot of them were amazed by my “strength.” It actually was healing for me to say out loud, cause it’s true. I was fighting myself but I did win in the end. And their reactions make it even fucking better. This one strictly works for young kids but yea. I wish you the best.

to a kid, they'll learn to associate those types of scars with something that can be talked about, and even have pride in. then if they see someone hiding theirs there could even be a conversation about being humble or smth like ""i don't need other people to see that i won for me to be glad that i did""

a lot of kids i've met now are a lot smarter than i was at their age, and their first exposure to things like scars are important in shaping how they see them growing up. if u were to very obviously try to hide them after a kid sees, they could very plausibly grow up to believe scars are something to be hidden and ashamed of."

hi there! i’m so sorry that your family doesn’t support you but that’s what the internet is for! you don’t have to hide your emotions from anybody. as sad as it sounds, let them see the way you actually feel. show them how miserable you are but you also have to realize that harming your body won’t make things better in the long run. it may feel good now but you’ll look back at these times and realize how horrible it was. don’t worry about whether it’s a sin or not, that is the last thing you need to worry about. try and find the joy in everyday life. it’s hard but not impossible. if you’d like a friend you can always pm me:) i love you and i wish you the best<3	Paws_with_Quads	reply	na	na	na	0.9977096319198608	strong	no	no	na	selfharm

Hey, Im an Orthodox Christian and i can help you out, you dont need to tell anyone (i didnt), you just need to know what is happening. I found out pretty early on (im 14 btw) into sh that it isnt you whom is degrading the body, its demons, they dont possess you but they can reside in you, meaning that The Holy Spirit isnt invited to your body at that time. All you need to do is turn to God, or as i did get a friend whom also self harms and you two could be clean together. Remember you dont need to tell anybody else, and i would understand your situation completely, bc its kinda the same, tbh it only strengthened my bond with God. If you want to pray, and get in touch with God, what i did was lay on bed (when i was going to sleep) or sit on a chair, and let Him in, you will know when He is there, then you pray for all to be forgiven, even your sh, He forgives all, your family portrays Him as unforgiving but you must know that He always loves ya, no matter what (its unconditional love btw).

"I am used to cutting somewhat deep; however, usually in high-risk areas, and as a consequence I am forced to get medical attention because it is difficult to hide. This time, I cut sort of deep on the top of my forearm, so it didn't bleed that much (at max i'd say 150 ml) but I think I hit fascia or was very close to hitting fascia, I couldn't see. 

I have cut this deep before, but it was in high-risk areas so I went to the hospital for it so I'm not really sure what to do. I don't have any medical supplies, not even simple bandages because my parents think if they get rid of supplies, I'll stop self-harming. All I have is a gauze wrap that I usually just use to cover wounds so I don't get blood on stuff. I'm not sure what to do, because allegedly cuts this deep can get pretty bad infections. 

I kind of blew my only chance to get help, because I had an appointment today, but I denied ever self-harming. My family is going on vacation tomorrow, and I don't want to ruin it. The psychiatrist at the hospital said that if I get caught self-harming ever again, that he'll get my parents to send me to the TTI which I really don't want. 

I'm just not really sure what to do, as I don't have anything I can keep the wound clean with, and I cannot get help. "	AugustusLloydDM	post	25.518783862039264	male	White	0.998457670211792	na	na	na	32	selfharm

"Hi. I have a close friend who used to harm themselves. They're clean for about 2 weeks now, I am trying to encourage them. They say things like ""I just want to do it and get rid of the urge."" or ""Soon the 2 weeks is going to be 0 days again.""
I do not know what to do. All I can tell them is that healing is not linear, relapsing is normal but I don't feel like it's enough. The ""getting rid of the urge"" worries me a lot. Are there alternatives that they can do when they feel the urge to self-harm?

Harm reduction. Using a rubber band or hair tie on the wrist and snapping it when they get the urge used to help me. Drawing in red or using a blade on something like paper to get the cutting urge out… idk it’s hard. Just be supportive and tell them they will eventually be able to ride the urges out, it’ll get easier, and they can do it.	mneljna	reply	na	na	na	0.9917238354682922	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

I know you aren’t able to use rusted knives, and the metal on my lighter looks slightly bronze and rusty, but I don’t know if that’s dangerous.

It would probably be better to swap it out, but as far as I know, the main concern with rust is small particles of it or the metal object that's corroded getting into a wound, which shouldn't be a risk if you don't break skin. Rust itself doesn't even cause tetanus like many people think, although any wound technically increases your risk of getting infected by the bacteria that cause it, but it's very rare anyway and you should be protected from it if you're up to date with your vaccination. And again, as long as you don't break skin at all, you should be pretty safe. Of course I'm not a professional though.	Milosaysmew	reply	na	na	na	0.005743684712797403	no	no	no	na	selfharm

Hey if that person wants sh then let them but also you mentioned that you show them your cuts which you shouldn’t really do unless they are healed as it can trigger them. Your scars not being “deep enough” doesn’t make you any less valid. In fact if you think about it there is no “deep enough” because even if you hit bone it still won’t be enough I think the stigma about “deep enough” needs to stop as it makes a lot of people feel invalid about their scars and it’s just an unnecessary stress. You should say to that person you don’t like that they thank you for starting their addiction (if it is an addiction that is) as it’s something you didn’t want them to do in the first place and it’s not a fun quirky thing to do it’s a scary life threatening thing to do. It comes across to me like they are doing it for the sake of doing it or just trying to “fit in” or be quirky.

Your scars are valid no matter how big or bad they are… it’s really stupid that they feel the need to try and prove they’re worse off than you because either way your struggles still matter. I used to be around people like this and my best advice is to try your best to stay away from them, they’re damaging your health and are likely aware of that and just don’t care.

i don't intend to be hostile or anything, but to be blunt, if you feel guilty, cut contact with them. they're getting something off of using you, obviously self-harm at the least but i dunno what else. this is a very unhealthy dynamic and you should get out of it"	doumasan_______036	reply	na	na	na	0.9993652701377869	strong	no	no	na	selfharm

"This happened a long time ago but it's something that has stuck with me for a long time especially since I don't know if I was fully in the wrong. Sorry for any tangents I go into, I'm super tired and don't know how much I should include into the backstory of the issue.

I (M20) always had a bad relationship with my step-dad who i'll call SD. He's never shown much love for me although to his defense claims that he does but I guess he likes to be the tougher parent as my biological mom has always been very soft on me (except for times where she was physically abusive, by soft I mean in terms of school work and general parenting). I started feeling depressed around the age of 10 due to physical abuse in the family (not related to SD) and bullying at school. A few years ago around the time that I was 17 SD realized some things were going on and forced me into confessing my depression or stay grounded for as long as I keep it secret. Reluctantly I told him about it and the abuse and that was that, he found out about my self harming attempts through seeing the scars and knew I was suicidal. Things got a lot worse after coming forward with this as my mom began lying about the abuse and probably genuinely forgot about some of it like the time she choked me and other incidents that happened less frequently and SD seemed to somewhat believe these claims that it was fake. They also didn't get me therapy until 6 months later despite me requiring it over and over and I eventually had to go to my councilor at school who basically forced it into them.

Now for the main AITA scenario

At home I had a room all to myself in what we will call room A, room B was my brother's room and recently my parents decided that room A would become my sister's room who was just becoming old enough to have a room to herself (she was around 2 at this point) keep in mind she wasn't actually going to begin using the room to sleep in just yet, for now they wanted to turn it into a playroom/sometimes a room to sleep in if they got lucky and she agreed for the given night. This whole thing meant I needed to move into room B with my brother and essentially lost all my privacy. This was really difficult for me as I was at the worst point depression-wise and really needed time to myself. One day I felt like attempting but I had no privacy and really felt the need to be in room A as to me it was a safe space, I also had my closet in room A where I would often sleep as I felt comfortable in enclosed spaces and I was in a really dark place at that point in time. Because of this I had a lack in judgement and I decided to attempt in my sister's room, again, she almost never goes in this room (maybe once or twice a week) and I wasn't thinking clearly (obviously) I locked the door and eventually after about an hour of SH and crying I was able to calm myself down and convinced myself to splash some water on my face, I hid the knife (not very well but keep in mind I was just going to walk across the hallway for 1 minute to splash water on my face and head back) but when I left the room my brother immediately went in to make a phone call. My brother walks out about a minute later due to finding the knife and went to go tell my parents. I ran back into room A took the knife and went to take a shower since I knew I was going to be in trouble and wanted to take some time away from that. When I got out I was greated by my parents who were extremely pissed off and knew I was attempting in there. I thought for a minute that they'd give me some form of tough love or say something about how stupid it was but all I got was my step dad looking at me and saying ""you could have hurt (sister's name)"". SD then banned me from ever going in that room again due to fear of me being a danger. At no point in that night did I get any form of help from either parent.

Now I know what I did was shit but I was in a horrible environment and a horrible mindset. I was mentally ill and I needed support from them, I just don't know if I'm the asshole? Are they the assholes? Is my SD the asshole? Are we all assholes? I don't know, please reddit help me out."	ThrowawayAITASD	post	14.165420480413648	male	White	0.9907575249671936	na	na	na	5	selfharm

I guess I'd also say ESH? You really shouldn't have left a knife in a room where a toddler goes and hidden it so badly that another person found it after one minute during a phone call. I know you didn't expect it to happen and it was quite unlikely, but you still left a weapon in a young child's playroom. I'm assuming by attempting you mean attempting suicide, in which case it's not really excusable to lock yourself in a two-year-old's room intending to die in there. Technically, you're an adult, so your family should prioritize your sister's safety over yours, because she's helpless to take care of herself. They definitely should have tried to help you in some way or at least addressed it, and it can be hard to get yourself help, like going to the hospital or a crisis center, when you're at an extremely low point.

"Remember me? I asked twice how I should tell my mother and stepfather. I told my mother over text on a spontaneous and sudden whim. It was stupid but I can copy and paste exactly what I said.
Me: Is now a bad time to tell you something super important and terrifying? I don't care anymore. I've hidden it since I was 11 so I think I did well in that sense. Maybe you already know. Something about the desperate way I was avoiding wearing short sleeves was a dead giveaway. I have such a deep sense of dread in my stomach right now and I'm shaking so hard. I don't care how much I don't want to do this, I don't have a choice. I have no clean long sleeve shirts so it was just a matter of time before something like this happened. You can see where this is going, can't you? I don't even know if I can type it out, I'm so scared. I feel so light headed at the thought but why does that matter? The scars are on me forever now anyway. I'm gonna send this before I can chicken out and pretend nothing ever happened. I cut myself. I've done it for a while and stopped a few months ago. I threw out the razor I was using a week or two ago. I'd like to say I've gotten better since but every time I look down at my arm, I feel myself start to cry. Please don't blame me for what I did. And also, please don't try to come into my room until I'm okay. I don't even know why I'm telling you this now of all times. The sudden courage makes me feel stupid. Please dear God read this before I can delete it. I love you.

That's what I said and I still feel sick. This happened just a few minutes ago. She came into my room. We cried. I cried more. She seemed to understand but also, she compared my scars to hers which I didn't appreciate much. I did lie about being clean, because I would've hated therapy. I'm not sure where to go from here.

You want to quit smoking, chew gum every time you have the urge to smoke. You want to stop cutting, find something else to do.

I cut as a distraction from life/work. I haven’t quite figured out what to replace it with, but it’s different for everyone. I tried building LEGO sets, but that gets really expensive.

Just find something to fill in the void of cutting. Something new, a distraction. Maybe walking/exercising."	Notwiliamarg	reply	na	na	na	0.9994624257087708	no	no	no	na	selfharm

Are you a student? Some schools should have resources for therapists, and you can ask your counselor. You don't have to go into details. Or do you have anyone close to you that you can confide in? Any type of support would be super helpful. What about coping skills? Hobbies? Is there anything particular you enjoy doing in your free time? Any major life changes that might be adding to your stress? If anything, I want to say that this too shall pass. Whatever is going on. Change is inevitable, and you won't feel this way forever.

I've been wondering about this for a while but every time I'm having a panic attack or I'm overwhelmed by emotions, it doesn't matter what they are.

"Absolutely.

Self Harm for many of us releases endorphins like the ones that release when we exorcise. There's also adrenaline some of the time. There are chemical reasons why we feel calm after. 

On the more emotional level, we all self harm for many different reasons but many of which have to do with us not being okay and not dealing with our current life situations very well. Whether it's to feel something, to feel in control, to escape, it's all a way of coping with emotions. It's really common to feel better after self harm.  Sometimes even elated. 

You're not alone.many of us here feel stress relief. It's unfortunately why it can become so difficult to stop the habit."	white_fox12	reply	na	na	na	0.0013688495382666588	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

It’s really hard to get over things especially in a circumstance like that, well for me it was because she was my emotional support. And I had no idea what to do. I learned that I can’t depend on other just for them to let you down. You have to pick yourselves back on your feet and keep going and not worry about other people.

Honestly I never thought I could. I’ve been having trouble with coping over how much I hate my job. It’s call center work so it’s soul sucking and I haven’t been to work for the past two weeks. I’ve been lying to my boyfriend who I live with and the pressure has been too much. Every time I think about going back to work to just sit and get yelled at by angry members it feels like I’m going crazy. I’m looking for new jobs right now which is definitely “fun”. I can’t tell if I’m being lazy or if something is wrong with me. I go to therapy and I’m not diagnosed with anything but nothing ever feels right. I’ve tried talking to my boyfriend too and he tries to comfort me but I think he has trouble saying things that will actually make me feel better. I didn’t really know what else to do and now my leg burns. I’m scared right now.	Acrobatic_Ad_7516	post	19.665399469388607	female	White	0.9987138509750366	na	na	na	1	selfharm
Update: So my boyfriend asked me if I was feeling okay today. I’ve been a lot more tired and I can already tell my responses to things have been slow and weird. Nothing crazy but just delays in my answers and coming across as angry. I don’t want him to know about what I’ve started because I don’t want to make him upset. I didn’t go into work again but I think I’ll try tomorrow. This sucks and I’ve never done this before. I’m also scared of talking to people about how I harmed myself because I’m afraid of getting thrown in some place where I’ll never see my boyfriend or my family again.

"I was just chilling in my room, absentmindedly ripping open the scabs in my legs with one hand while cleaning the blood off with the other when I had the sudden thought of ""wait, this ain't normal"". And then I took the time to really *look* at my legs (I'm really self concious about them so I barely spare them a passing glance) and just saw a whole lotta scars and some really fucking big injuries that I made by scratching my skin so hard I rip off lil bits of flesh. I just scratch untill I bleed, wait untill it scabc over, rip it out, rinse and repeat until it gets bigger and bigger. Which definitely ain't healthy.

No matter where I look at myself, there's either a small (or big) injury or a fading scar. My legs, my arms, my hands, my torso, my *face.* I even needed to get my leg bandaged, like, last week.

I have no idea how to stop, I don't even realize I'm doing it. I told myself I'd stop then a few days later only realized I was tearing into my skin again halfway through ripping a scab off. It's something I've been doing since I was, like, three years old. Some of my earlier memories are of my mother scolding me for leaving the sofa all bloodied. Hell, I've even still got some scarring from when I literally bit a chunk off my right leg when I was seven! (holy shit that was fucked up, I'm just now realizing. The gauze and bandages coverd like a third of my leg wtf)

And this thing, it's constant. I'm constantly injuring myself. I've subconsciously torn open 5+ small injuries while writting this post, and it's been like 10 min max since I started writting it.

I also realized like halfway through writting this that punching myself hard enough to make me dizzy and banging my head against walls also isn't very healthy and is in fact self harm.

I'm 15 now and only just realizing this is a problem. I have no idea how to stop. I feel like an addict that can't stay sober. I wanna stop, but I got no idea how. Psychiatric help isn't an option and neither is medication. I can't get either without my parent's consent and they don't think this is an issue.

"im not sure about the hitting your head part, but since you said the picking is involuntary, you've been doing it since you were three, you do it without realising etc, i don't think thats self harm, probably just a very bad detrimental habit. self harm is intentional harm majoritarily to express deep emotion.

like, i bite my nails to the point of them bleeding and leaving my nail bed exposed, till it hurts to use my hands for anything bc all my fingers are hurting so bad, but it's unconscious. like you i say I'll stop and then find myself doing it a few days after. a bad habit/something similar.

for the hitting yourself bit, maybe try hitting your head on/hitting your head with soft things? when i was about 11 i thought for some reason the best way to process anger was to hit my head against the wall, so i started doing the same thing but instead of the wall i used a pillow, and that helped me"	WeirdAlienCat	reply	na	na	na	0.9965720176696777	no	no	no	na	selfharm
"Hitting urself or banging against a wall is self harm, skin picking is not

Self harm is physical harm done with full intent, this isn't the same as involuntary skin picking
However, skin picking until there's scars and blood is definteley sth I experience and it's hard to get rid of, first things first this can come from a variety of disorders but it's usually from anxiety, I'd say get a fidget or stimmt toy and always have it in ur pocket, try to redirect ur mind into going for the object instead of ur skin

"There's many different alternatives out here. 
I like to break mine down into sections to better find what I need. 

Distraction:  playing games, reading, journaling, cleaning, talking to someone, art or other creative hobbies, puzzles. Generally things that engage your mind in a way that effectively gets you to forget about the urge. 

Endorphin: going for a run or walk, swimming, weight training/working out, riding a bike or other physically engaging transport. The idea is to release the same chemicals that are often released when you sh, but this way you are being productive as well! 

Relaxation:  meditation, a shower or bath, enjoying calming music, sitting outside and simply existing with your surroundings.  Anything that you find puts you in a state of feeling calm, safe, and release stress. 

Replacement: holding ice cubes in the hands or placing ice cubes on the areas you usually sh, using a Self Harm Reduction Pen, drawing on the skin with a marker, pen, or even makeup, flicking a rubber band on yourself. The goal is to replicate a similar sensation without actually causing harm.

Some extras that I wasn't sure where to place: being around people (who don't stress you out). I like to go to coffee shops for example. Skin care and other forms of personal grooming. Window shopping (if you aren't easily tempted to splurge!) I find it can be really nice to put my energy into ideas to decorate my space. If window shopping isn't a good choice, maybe a Pinterest board instead. 
Some people have found that drawing a butterfly on the area they sh and naming it is a decent way of preventing sh, too.

I have always struggled in school because I’m not a very smart person when it comes to book stuff like maths Spanish English ect and I also am a loud and most people who get to know me think I’m a nice funny person but the problem is that I’m not like myslef around people I’m not close with so I struggle to make friends I have no friends in my base class wich isn’t too bad I have friends in my year but all in different class bad luck ig and I get so scarded with partner work and stuff like that I also I’m so tired in school I fall asleep in all my classes wich makes me fall behind and gets me in trouble and gives me a bad rep to my teachers who the give me a hard time  all of the stuff I said mixed with the fact my mam is always on the schools side and loads of other stuff that I don’t have the energy to type lol I get really low and low-key suicidal during school I’m a lot happier during the summer time when half of my problems go away temporarily but during school I always start cutting myself going to sleep late not talking to my friends and not eating and simply not trying in school beacuse I don’t have the energy takes a toll on me I don’t have depression or anxiety just normal amount that anyone has and I’m sure many people feel this way but I wish I could tell somone how I feel during that period of time cause I truely feel so lonely and have thoughts of unaliveing myslef (dw i have never tried) so Often that I just need someone to talk to like why do u think I’m on Reddit writing a big paragraph lmao I would never reach out for help tho I don’t have it too bad I have struggled with mental health and sh for a while but nothing serious just stuff from my childhood and stuff so I’m ok but I wish somone knew what was happening so I could just get it off my chest I have had to talk to my year head many times about my sleeping and lasch of effort in school and he always asks me what’s going on but as iff I tell the school and peopel see different and my family knowing I’m not special and the way I feel is probably the same saddens a normal person has been through I’m probably just being dramatic but it feel good typing this out and getting off my chest without it having a impact on my life but if anyone has tips on how to make school more enjoyable and how to work harder in school that don’t exclude trying to get help I don’t need that would be great cause I’m seriously worried that I’m gonna ruin my future .	bblqueen3	post	14.569459976042108	male	White	0.9969902038574219	na	na	na	0	selfharm

"If I don’t do, I might do something worse. I lost my utility knife that I originally tricked my mom into getting for me. The first day of school she made me go with no hoodie. I don’t go deep so my scars are pretty small I’ve just noticed. But I’m kinda addicted to looking at them. During one of my classes E-period specifically I kept scratching. I wanted to bleed, I wanted to hurt myself in class. I was quiet for most of the day and I’m probably gonna quit football already.

Not cause I don’t wanna play it’s cause of the physical. I just don’t feel comfortable doing it. I’m a scardy bitch but hell you have to change In front of people what if they see. When I do get a new a one I’m prolly gonna try it on my thighs. In one of my classes math actually I got handed scissors. They were dull sadly so I put them down. I tried stabbing my self with a pencil to quench my urge but it didn’t do much. So much blood will come out and that’s all I need. I don’t wanna die, I wanna be ok.

"Someone else’s self harm is never your fault, even if it happens “because of something you said/did” unless you’re telling her to hurt herself or intentionally triggering her (not saying you would!). 

Relapses are part of recovery, and you can’t make her quit (you can gently encourage her without pressuring her, and don’t make it about you). Whether or not she does relapse, all you can do is offer support and ask *her* how you might help her.

Keep communication very clear with her. Just remember that you can’t make her quit, recovery does exist though. The best thing is to be honest. Also remember that you aren’t capable of causing her to SH. Her self harming isn’t because of you.

"Most important thing (with everything really) is communication.  She told you about it, which means she trusts you, which is obviously very important.
If you're both open to it, ask her the things you want to ask. Be gentle, don't judge, if she can't or doesn't want to answer, accept it, don't force her to tell you things.
I get you want her to stop, but you can't force her. It's also not easy to stop, it's an addiction. She probably knows it's not healthy coping. Maybe you can try to explore together what other coping techniques can help her? 
Also, it's never your fault!

"Instead of focusing on wanting her to quit, focus on supporting her, show that you care about her regardless of her mental health and possible self harm. 

My partner said the most helpful thing to me: ""I will never blame you or make you feel ashamed of cutting yourself, but I will celebrate with you every time you decide *not* to.""

For me, there's no pressure to always be happy or get better, there's room for my emotional setbacks, and I know that it's safe to be vulnerable and real with him. 

He doesn't make me responsible for his emotions. I can show him my scars and wounds without guilt or shame. With him, there's only support and understanding, and he reassures me that it's okay to hurt.

Just try to be a positive in her life, a reliable, safe person.

"Hey, not sure what to say or do but if it helps I could maybe tell you my experience with sh? That may give you a bit more of an understanding maybe?

I have been doing it on and off since primary, not sure what year but I’m in highschool right now, think it’s my last year in school.

For me this year has been really really hard and I started again around Christmas and I’m trying to stop. I may relapse but that is a part of recovery. To be honest it scares me sometimes. Everyone has different triggers and different ways of.. dealing with it? And not everyone will be the same when or if you try to help them.

For me I guess I’d rather just someone be there for me to stop me from doing it I guess. Like I said everyone is different so what helps for others might not help for some and that’s ok, that doesn’t mean something is wrong with you, we’re all just human.

Sorry I ramble a lot.

As I was saying,

For me maybe having someone there to listen to me helps, just quiet maybe, telling me to take my time maybe. It can take time to open up sometimes and with some topics it can be harder to talk about.

I’m going to be honest I don’t really know much unless it’s in the moment I guess? If it’s happening?

I’m sorry if I’m not of much help.

If it’s ok maybe some advice might help?

I say maybe just try sit down with her maybe, if she wants to talk about it. Listen to her, try not to push her too much to say things and stuff, just let her know your there for her I guess and please try not to blame yourself, her sh is not your fault so please try not to blame yourself because I promise you, it is not your fault.

i don’t want you to think anything she’s doing is your fault. i sh’d for 3 years and never wanted to quit, until my boyfriend helped me. my boyfriend is the whole reason i stopped cutting. this doesn’t mean threaten leaving her if she doesn’t stop, but encouraging healthier ways to cope! try to get her to talk to you when she gets the urge to do it. try to distract her from everything going on in her mind. also try to find the root of the problem but go about it sensibly. the most you can do is talk to her and show her that you actually care. that alone was enough to stop me. i relapsed one time a month into being clean with one cut and i felt so horrible when my boyfriend saw it. i promise things will get better for the both of you it just takes time. my bf and i have been together 3 years and i’ve been 3 years clean:)

obviously, you can’t ban someone for their body that’s clearly body shaming but she has admitted, and it’s quite clear that she has an eating disorder, which is self harm and it’s almost as if she is posting these super cringey pics and videos with no content whatsoever. At this point, it really feels like she’s flaunting it. I know that if she was banned from Instagram and other social media accounts, it would open up a huge can of worms for body shaming, but I feel like in this particular case she’s gone overboard. idk🤷🏻‍♀️ curious to see what others think	RiseXagainst89	post	22.57788977793628	male	White	0.9994932413101196	na	na	na	2	selfharm

She's one of the most controversial people on the internet, I think there've been petitions to get her banned for years. She barely even admits anything's wrong, she used to say her body looked this way naturally. Most of her audience consists of young girls and she's constantly getting attention online for being so emaciated. It's not just that she might trigger others, this isn't good for her either. Almost everyone knows of her, she'd never be viral if she wasn't extremely sick. I don't see a way for her to get any better with her online presence being like this.

"so ive been sh free for maybe a year, and i have some pretty bad scars on both thighs and an arm. ive never had any cuts checked out or stitched - even when i know they should have been - and have had a lot if not most of my cuts get infected, which i would just let heal on their own. (about a month if it was bad)

recently ive noticed any wounds i get, or new piercings, become infected very easily. I’m worried that my immune system has weakened due to untreated infections, and i now easily get sick, and usually stay sick for a few weeks at most.

is this something i should be worried about, or being up with my doctor?"	namukim	post	22.56610924613596	male	White	0.9967485666275024	na	na	na	1	selfharm
Definitely talk to your doctor about this. I feel like a similar thing is happening to me, I mostly managed to avoid infection during years of SH, but I had to take oral antibiotics twice in the past two months for infected burns and now every fresh wound I have immediately gets infected even when it's treated correctly and right away.	namukim	reply	na	na	na	0.9967485666275024	weak	strong	no	na	selfharm

If you have scars on your arms, maybe you could get away with wearing a long-sleeved shirt under your uniform or some arm sleeves. Foundation/make-up could help, but it doesn't seem very practical for work.	Born_Constant258	reply	na	na	na	0.99620121717453	no	no	no	na	selfharm

My dad is NOT the caring type. hes caused me so much trauma and is the main reason for me sh'ing. but this time, he actually cared

he took me on a drive around 11 pm to 1am and we just talked about it. he said he understood how i was feeling and was begging me to stop.

it was nice, and ive been clean for 2weeks at that moment so it gave me even more hope to quit 

until i found my razor was gone the next morning. and ever since the car ride, i feel like they lost even more trust in me

it stressed me the fuck out, and it still does. Now if i get the urge again, what am i gonna do? I dont want to have to resort to something really unsafe.

"Ok so I read some of the comments and im probably just gonna repeat things a bit but here's what I would do that might help u too.
First of all, if ur comfortable with it, tell ur parents about how the car ride with ur dad helped u feel better and that you'd like those types of moments to happen more frequently. Also tell em about that u lost ur razor and if they took it that it would be better for ur recovery if it would be in ur room, since it would be ur doing then if u didn't cut and not someone else's doing (this whole bit is incase they took it cuz they don't want u to cut).
Distract urself. Be with ur family, look for hobbies that seem fun and try it out. Just anything that u find fun to do that's not sh, give it a try and do it.

So, the same thing happened to me. Both of my tools were gone and I got stressed out, however

When I get the urges to do it again (in my earlier stages of recovery, not as much anymore), I either have a rubber band or a hairtie on my wrist at all times. You pull back (not too far, just enough for elasticity) and let it hit your wrist. It's a really nice distractor 

When my scars started to fade, I started craving those ""lines"" that I'd always get from cutting. So, I would use a thin piece of thread and hold it against my leg/arm until it made an indent.

"If you can help it, don't relapse. It is never worth the shame of seeing those scars every day, being restricted in what you wear.. and in my head I know that, and I'm sure you do too. It's just so damn hard sometimes, especially being in deep poverty on top of having untreated mental illness. No one cares about you when you're broke bc you have nothing to offer them. People stigmatize the mentally ill for being ""weird"" or ""crazy"" when all we need is someone to care about us.

 If you ever need to reach out, feel free. I care about every person I come across IRL and on the net. Maybe not always a good thing, but... How I am. My dream is to help people, tbh. If I had the money I'd go to school to become a therapist.

Im curious— and I hope I dont sound rude, I cut seriously for over 30 years and have only been recovered maybe a year now. I know what a horrible thing it is and I remember very well all the feeling I jad when cutting, So Im not judging, Im just contemplating something. I see a lot of people on reddit asking if their self harm or their scars are“valid”. What does that mean to you?  It was something i dont think i thought about it when I was self injuring.  I certainly may have but not using that term.  Why does it matter if your scars are valid? All self injuring is hard/sad/etc. I had extreme self harm issues, and some years not so extreme. I wish I didnt have the scars at least on my arm, as an adult professional they make me self conscious. I am at a point now where I wear short sleeves at work, but thats because as a 50 year old I just dont care anymore what people think- if they want to judge me, thats their problem. But I still wear long sleeves around my family all the time because I dont want my parents to know (i keep all my different struggles a secret from my parents.) ANYWAY— what does being “valid” mean?

"I don't really have a text book definition of what ""valid"" means but to me it means that the self harm that I was doing is actually something ""serious"", I guess. I self harmed because it felt to me there was literally no other way to even make me feel alive and human, not some sort of boy who cried wolf or attention seeking to be pitied or treated better by people. 

Another aspect that a lot of people have to being ""valid"" is how severe the self harm is, it's almost a sort of messed up competition with others and self. ""Oh, I didn't hit the dermis layer of skin with this cut, I'm just being an attention seeker because of that.""

I think a lot of what has to do with the whole ""valid"" thing is because most people judge self harmers as what I've said before just attention seekers and not people with actual problems in their life."	NewfyMommy	reply	na	na	na	0.010597992688417435	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

sh is sh. that’s it. no hate to any specific people, but seeing posts on this sub every day from people asking if their sh counts or is valid is so incredibly frustrating to me and i think the internet is to blame for it. it’s good to have a space to talk about your issues with others who understand, but being exposed to literally thousands of other people’s sh has got to be unhealthy. it can really warp your view of what is normal"	NewfyMommy	reply	na	na	na	0.010597992688417435	weak	strong	no	na	selfharm
"for me valid means that everyone can see my pain and take it seriously, that I'm not ""faking"" it for attention. and sometimes that means harming myself in every way imaginable to prove that I am valid"	NewfyMommy	reply	na	na	na	0.010597992688417435	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
That makes sense. I hate it that people judge those of us who self harm.  Perhaps there are people who do it for attention but I certainly dont know anyone like that. To me it was always about feeling SO full of pain that i couldnt hold any more in and self harm was a way i thought got it “out.” I know now that it really doesnt, that the feeling a bit better afterwards was just endorphins, but it sure helped at the time. I had a friend a long time ago who seemed to be in competition with me for who could do it worse and that didnt make any sense to me. Even though i havent cut in over a year and havent done serious self harm in several years, to be honest some times I miss it.

"What's always been upsetting to me about the outsider's view of self harm is that they refuse to even begin to comprehend why someone would want to hurt themselves and what's underlying that causes it so they just condense it down to wanting attention and nothing more. There's definitely people who self harm for attention but it's a cry of help to acknowledge the underlying causes and mental issues of what's making them do it not some sort of needy want of privileges.

As far as your old friend goes, I really hope that they didn't shame you for your self harm not being as severe as theirs. If they ever did I'm sorry, it's a way of downplaying whatever you may be going through mentally because it's not showing physically and it's truly awful that people feel the need to shame others or themselves because of it.

I've also been clean of self harm for a while and I understand missing it too, I just try to remind myself why I stopped and how I know it's not gonna feel as good as I'm building up in my head because every time I've relapsed it never felt as good as it did  when I was deep in it."

I just feel so guilty.  My mother and therapist think I'm 70 days clean.  Not to mention, I finally got the courage to wear short sleeves around my friends after YEARS.  One of my friends ended up reaching out to me after we hung out cause he was worried.  I told him I was clean, and sent him a screenshot of my (fake) days clean.  I told him not to worry.  He told me he was proud of me.  This was about a week ago.  After that conversation, I really really tried to stay clean.  I didn't want to keep lying.  I relapsed again today.  I'm so fucking worthless.  Everyone keeps praising me for all the progress I've made; progress that isn't mine, it doesn't belong to me.  I'm just a fucking liar.  I'm so fucking paranoid all the time that they'll end up finding out.  I don't want to deal with this anymore.

there’s not really a way to get rid of the urges but there are things you can do to suppress them. i am so sorry you’re going through a hard time right now but imagine how proud you’ll be overcoming this without relapsing! try to distract yourself with things that make you happy like funny cat videos or other things that bring you joy. i’m 3 years clean and still get urges but you just can’t act on them. it will get easier as time goes on. you are loved and you matter❤️	Godd-ess	reply	na	na	na	0.9978060126304626	strong	no	no	na	selfharm

What are some things I could do in place of SH?	Brokem_12	post	32.49287314043363	male	White	0.9965840578079224	na	na	na	3	selfharm
"There's many different alternatives out here. 
I like to break mine down into sections to better find what I need. 

Distraction:  playing games, reading, journaling, cleaning, talking to someone, art or other creative hobbies, puzzles. Generally things that engage your mind in a way that effectively gets you to forget about the urge. 

Endorphin: going for a run or walk, swimming, weight training/working out, riding a bike or other physically engaging transport. The idea is to release the same chemicals that are often released when you sh, but this way you are being productive as well! 

Relaxation:  meditation, a shower or bath, enjoying calming music, sitting outside and simply existing with your surroundings.  Anything that you find puts you in a state of feeling calm, safe, and release stress. 

Replacement: holding ice cubes in the hands or placing ice cubes on the areas you usually sh, using a Self Harm Reduction Pen, drawing on the skin with a marker, pen, or even makeup, flicking a rubber band on yourself. The goal is to replicate a similar sensation without actually causing harm.

Some extras that I wasn't sure where to place: being around people (who don't stress you out). I like to go to coffee shops for example. Skin care and other forms of personal grooming. Window shopping (if you aren't easily tempted to splurge!) I find it can be really nice to put my energy into ideas to decorate my space. If window shopping isn't a good choice, maybe a Pinterest board instead.

"today at about 4am I had a very small discussion with my mother, but it made me feel really bad in no time for no reason at all. I prepped everything to cut myself, and surprisingly, I got my deepest cut yet.

I feel extremely dissappinted in myself for relapsing, but seeing it go so deep and instantly fill with blood was a tiny fascinating and a little exciting, I couldnt stop looking at it.

I really don't want to romanticize my self harm at all, but I can't help it.

"Hi
I’m 17, autistic, and I had an awful childhood. Don’t wanna bore you, but the gist is I was excluded, bullied and neglected by a broke family and exposed to a lot of trauma at an early age.

Therapy is going pretty shitty because I’ve only been able to get a short session every 2 weeks and it is the least helpful thing I’ve ever gone to (very unprofessional but sadly it’s all I’ve got).

Recently I’ve been having really concerning thoughts about injuring myself to the point of hospitalisation.

Obvious TW for what’s coming up.

Every time I see a knife or scissors I have an overwhelming urge to stab myself. When I see a car I want to jump in front of it. Early I spent 30 minutes unable to stop thinking about how I’d hospitalise myself- whether it’s severing a finger or breaking my arm.

These thoughts are scaring me. What scared me more is the fact that when I have them I’m not scared- if anything the opposite. I feel comforted at the idea of being injured.

Is this a cry for help? I feel like I want to ‘show’ people what I’ve gone through and prove that my pain is real. Earlier on I stabbed a pin through my leg and it felt ‘good’? 

Can someone help me? What is wrong with me?"	AshamedAndGay	post	20.114176480653498	female	White	0.9971345663070679	na	na	na	2	selfharm

"Just a summary for those of you planning on hitting deeper depths, if you think the wound has stopped weeping and you're ready to dry heal it, be REALLY sure, otherwise you'll end up with a stuck dressing.

So, some of you have probably seen my post regarding my gf who obviously isn’t good for me- she said I was more fun when u was obsessed with her and was cutting because she wouldn’t talk to me. I have bpd among a few other things- I suffer with depression, anxiety, derealization/ depersonalization along with the bpd. It’s hard. But, last Friday, I was going to break up with her. She thought something was wrong and kept pushing until I broke and said I was having a hard time. Mostly as I have been seeing lots of shadows and hearing all these voices. I know I need to speak with my doctor and I will.. the biggest thing was, she said I needed help and like that set me off. She has not replied to me for a while which is a good thing, but I still have not ended thing. I’ve been speaking with some friends who are going to help me to break up with her, but due to my episode, we’re gonna be waiting until I’m a bit more stable. I just hate that I’m so scared to break up with her. After everything, she had said that she wanted to hurt me in so many different ways- cutting up my body, she wanted to SA me. I have been in the past- she knows this. She said she wanted to break my bones. She has said a whole fucking lot. Not to even mention the suicide pact. She even asked me a few days ago why I- a trans guy, didn’t just be a tomboy insider of *being trans* she’s a trans girl. I would’ve expected a bit more from her. She even said I should give it some thought. That made me cut pretty bad. I’m gonna end things. I just hate that I feel like I can’t. I hate that I feel so responsible for her, that I feel like I can’t leave. I hate it that I feel like everything is my fault and like sometimes thinking I’m actually the bad one in this relationship and she actually cared about me. That she actually loves me. I hate that even with screen shots and proof of what has happened that I feel like I made it all up. I’ve told my friends. They have told me numerous times, they have seen the proof, they know I’m not making any of this up, this is what she wants.. she wants me to feel like this, I just wish I could actually see it"	hoonihunni	post	21.162260852553082	male	White	0.9984757304191589	na	na	na	2	selfharm
i just want you to know that you feel this way because of HER. you CAN leave. but also, some of the things you mentioned she said sound extremely dangerous. when breaking things off with her, consider your safety as well (not trying to discourage you from leaving, get the hell out of that relationship!) if she threatens you or seems like she wants to harm you, please tell someone. whether it’s law enforcement or your family. but please leave this toxic situation asap. you will feel so much better about yourself and life in general. it’s hard to get away from people like this but it’s possible. i wish you the best of luck and you are so loved❤️	hoonihunni	reply	na	na	na	0.9984757304191589	weak	no	no	na	selfharm

"I’ve sorta decided to cut that way to not be able to hide it, (I’m sorta new to all this sh and shit like I started earlier this year) when I’m out and shit I obv want to hide it but when I’m w my mom I sorta want her to notice I’m not ok. So I’ve cut around my arm so that I can’t hold my arm in any natural way that hides it. When I’m in the “real world” again I sorta hate it but when I’m cutting I think that it’s good to like get my mom to notice, but I also feel like I’m punishing myself which I guess also is a lot of the reason I do it to begin with. when I’m there cutting it also takes more time w less cut like trying to go all around is sorta hard so it takes more time and keep me busy ig

i understand wanting your mom to notice but this is not the way to go about it! i tried for years to get my mom to notice but she never did. you have to ask for help. as scary as it sounds, in the end, she’s only gonna want what’s best for you. you do NOT need to punish yourself for anything. you are perfect just the way you are, no matter how you see yourself. especially if you started earlier this year, it’s best to reach out for help now instead of waiting until you fall so deep you can’t escape. i’ve been clean 3 years now and fully believe you can do it too. you are so loved and i wish you the absolute best<3 you are more than welcome to pm me if you’d like to talk more<3 (18f)	justanotherwaster_	reply	na	na	na	0.9956063628196716	weak	strong	no	na	selfharm

It’s not that i can’t talk about it it’s that I can’t ask for help. I never needed help before in anything so I never learned to ask for help, and I think she already knows they’re and she’s asked “what’s that?” And I’ve either avoided the question or just answered cats or something then walked away. But I want her to like sit me down and ask in a way where I can’t escape and she gets the answers because I can answer but I can’t ask for help	justanotherwaster_	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9956063628196716	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
you CAN ask for help. you can do anything. all you have to say is “hey can we talk” and then just express your feelings. you’re not supposed to be calm cool and collected during these situations so don’t even worry about going about it the right way because there really isn’t one. i know it’s easier for them to come to you first but it’s a lot safer and healthier the earlier you ask for help and i promise with every bone in my body you are going to feel so much better. it’s extremely hard and i understand how you feel but if you can recognize that you need help, it’s time to ask for help. even if it’s just a school counselor that you tell. it’ll still get back to your mom without you having to ask HER for help. i’m sorry if i seem insensitive i’m just sharing what helped for me. personally i did write my mom many letters asking for help just because i didn’t know how to verbally. just try writing a letter out explaining how you feel. even if you don’t give it to her, let those emotions out in a healthy way<3	justanotherwaster_	reply	na	na	na	0.9956063628196716	weak	no	no	na	selfharm

hi there! my mom saw my scars a few years back and it absolutely ripped me to shreds and honestly, seeing how much it hurt her encouraged me to get help and stop. do NOT be embarrassed by them seeing. they don’t understand what you’re going through but there are also many other healthier skills you can use to cope. try distracting yourself by reading or watching content that you enjoy/ makes you laugh. if that isn’t enough try exercising or going on walks when you get urges. and also, take care of yourself. have a self care day and let the whole day revolve around you. recognize the things that make you happy and surround yourself with them. i’ve been clean for 3 years now i fully believe you can too. you are so loved and so cared about. i wish you the absolute best and hope you can recover soon:)<3	diecleanandpretty	reply	na	na	na	0.9991471767425537	weak	strong	no	na	selfharm

I'm trying not to stress out too much, because it's supposed to be a chill family weekend. But I'm so worried my family will talk about them.

I typically have a really hard time telling people online no when it comes to doing sexual stuff but he's been helping me work through it and be able to tell people no. Last night we got in an argument because he told me that a boy that I'm really in love with won't love me forever and I told him that I didn't want him to put doubt into my head. He didn't take this very well and he hung up on me and told me he was going to give me space for a little bit.

hello! we don’t know eachother but i want you to know that i love and care about you. i (18f) went through a very similar situation when i was your age. the best thing you can do is cut 28m off. i know he’s your friend but he’s still grooming you. as an 18 year old, i don’t even want to befriend 16 year olds, let alone being 28 and “friends” with a 15 year old (im trying to put this the nicest way possible im sorry if i hurt your feelings) but just know that he is doing you more harm than good and it’s best to find someone closer in age, even if they’re still older than you. when you look at the big picture, a man almost twice your age should not want to be friends with you. even if it hasn’t gone as far as grooming yet, it will. once again, i love you and i’m sorry if i hurt your feelings but i’m trying to share what helped me deal with this<3	Drunkbitch32	reply	na	na	na	0.9988647699356079	weak	strong	no	na	selfharm

I truly don't feel like he's currently grooming me or is going to. He's really been a huge help to me within the time that I've known him. I used to be really easily manipulated especially by older men, and even people my age. I truly don't think he wants anything bad from me and I think he wants to help me stop my self from being groomed like I have been in the past. It just really hurts that he won't talk to me.

"Hi, so i‘ve been clean for several months, don’t know exactly how long. Few days ago out of nowhere I started scratching my self with scissors. I have no idea why I did it, nothing happened, I was not dissociating or anything. If I wouldn’t know an better, I would say I did it because I was … bored. 
I know that something else is the reason for the sh but I don’t know what it is. 

Can anyone relate with that?"	psy-snoop	post	27.305495439382256	male	White	0.997631311416626	na	na	na	2	selfharm

I understand:( been clean for a while but the thought of relapsing always lingered in my head. Always found myself wanting to reach for a pair of scissors or anything sharp ? Idk either, I initially thought maybe it was out of boredom but maybe its because I always craved it, like my week or month wouldn't really be complete if I didn't at least try or at least think about it once in a while, which I know is wrong but I just can't help but think about it	psy-snoop	reply	na	na	na	0.997631311416626	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
Hi, I'm 26. The last time I did this, I was 15 due to extreme bullying. I've been doing my best not to do it again but I find myself in this dark corner once again. I am a bisexual and I grew up in a Christian family. The thing is, my mom said that she accepts me. However, every little inconveniences in her life, she would blame me for causing her misfortunes because of me being a bisexual and for  liking a girl. I really love my mom with all my heart but I can't take being her emotional punching bag every single time. I know the best would be to move out. But I can't do that yet because I feel the need to stay by her side to help her financially 😔 I don't want to self harm again that I threw away all the blades I used to keep. However, tonight I feel so down that I even used a needle to inflict myself pain, ending my 11 year clean streak.  Feeling the pain makes me feel more alive 😔 I just feel the need to let this out Because I can't tell anyone. They all think my mom is this perfect single parent who does all her best 😔 And I don't want others to see her in a bad light that's why I always keep things to myself 😔 You don't have to say anything, I just want to vent 😔	ceyzzzzzz	post	16.563314685367533	female	White	0.9820709228515625	na	na	na	6	selfharm

"I know many peoples do but for me its for a specific reason i think. I started cutting when i was 11/12 and my other friends that also did at this time now talk about sh like something cringe that "" we used to do to be cool "" and like no ? I never done it to be cool ?? Yes i was joking about it but i needed help ? We all needed help. It wasnt funny?

But anyway when i was 12 the cuts werent bad at all just cat scratches and now when i do cuts like that where i barely bleed i feel like im this weird kid that want attention. The kid my friends make fun off. I hate that so each time its not deep enough i have to cut again and again in the cut until i doesnt feel this way. 
Even now the cuts arent bad but since its already deeper than when i was 11/12 its alright

A lot of people can relate to that idea, I did. I have keloids that are still itchy over a decade now. I still have a scar on my leg that hurts when I touch it from also over a decade now. All because of the idea of ""I'm not cutting deep enough.""

"That can be a lot of things, but that does kinda of narrow it down to feeling real/alive, relieving stress and memories, using it to distract the memories or feeling like she deserves what she is doing. If it’s to feel alive you can help her find other healthier ways to feel like a real person, that could be using fidgeting tools or sensory objects, for example; those books that have a different texture on each side, you probably wouldn’t use that but there are similar things like that. That could help because she would feel something, she would be able to feel the textures and the temperature, which could alert her. It wouldn’t have the same effect that selfharm would have but it could help with reducing the amount she selfharms. If she is doing it to relieve stress or memories, try talking to her about it (if you haven’t already) find things that will distract her and make her comfortable and happy. This could be hobbies, or places, pretty much anything. Pools, beaches, parks, stores, restaurants, valleys, places with activities like roller skating, ice skating, arcade, pottery, etc,. Or even being with you. Those aren’t the only options, obviously, there are so many places to go, and things to do. If she has urges maybe you could take her somewhere she likes, or hang out with her. You can reassure her everything will be okay, and that she is strong, reassure her that she can do it and keep going. Taking her to places she likes can help her feel comfortable and can help relieve some of her stress or what ever she is feeling. It can also take her away from what she would do, for temporary time but in my experiences and some of the experiences of people I know, doing something we like, especially with someone we love it can help reduce the urge to selfharm. It might not get rid of the urge completely, but it could help reduce it a little. It not only could relieve her negative feelings and/or memories but it could also help distract her from those feelings and urges. If she is doing it because she thinks she deserves it, reassure that she doesn’t. Reassure her nothing is her fault. You might have to do that with other things like taking her places she likes or other things like that but reassurance does and can help.

You could try talking to her about it too, I don’t know her so I don’t know what she is like, but talking to her about what she thinks could her could give an idea. A lot of people say they don’t know, not saying she would say that but a lot of people do, if you talk to her and she says that don’t push her for an answer because she most likely really does not know. 

Harm reduction tools don’t work for some people but for a lot of people they can help, you said you’ve tried a lot so I don’t know if you’ve tried that or not but if you haven’t maybe talk to her about it. Don’t get it without asking or telling her about it because sometimes those don’t work and sometimes it can be a trigger. There are common harm reduction tools like snapping a rubber band, or holding an ice cube on your skin. But you can also find some online.

Selfharm can also be from her bottling up her emotions, if it’s okay with you you should tell her and reassure her that she can talk to you and that it’s okay for her to talk to you about what she feels. Sometimes just listening helps. And discuss triggers as well so that you can help and help her avoid her triggers. She might also say no to that too but everyone has at least one trigger, if she doesn’t know what it is you two should figure it out. Figuring out what triggers her is going to be a big step in helping her recover. Her knowing her triggers will help too, so she can avoid those triggers herself. 

Selfharm is a very difficult and different experience for everyone so this might not work or help 100% but they are suggestions of what you can try. Recovery takes long and relapse will be apart of it, you’ll just have to keep trying. I hope this helps and I hope things get better ❤️‍🩹"	Kaoticreator_	reply	na	na	na	0.9969313144683838	no	no	no	na	selfharm
"I fucked up numerous times today and I fucking hate myself and I just want to kms at this point.

I found out my boyfriend is losing interest in me (he said it to some friends in a room in highrise, not knowing I was there) and I fucking hate myself over it. I think it's cuz I told him I sh and that I did some illegal shit (like I told him seperate things at different times over the span of like 2-3 months). He's been a bit more distant and I don't want to talk about it to him cuz he's very sensitive and I don't want to hurt him.

Also just a few minutes ago I accidentally hit my sister in the head with a closer door by pushing it while she was behind it. I immediately said sorry like a million times but she kept yelling stuff like ""wtf why did u do that"" and ""sorry doesn't take the pain away does it!?"" Then I said I'm still apologizing so she knows I'm sorry and she said ""well I don't accept it, now happy!?"" And I fucking cried inside. 

Now I'm crying and I fucking want to cut myself so badly rn but I don't have my blade with me and I can't get it without my family noticing. I fucking hate myself and I just want to die rn.

Guy I've been seeing, knien each other for years but recently started a more bf/gf type relationship. We haven't talked about what we are or if we're exclusive. im honestly too scared and nervous to ask about it in fear of rejection or seeming too demanding or needy. we've basically been living together for like 4 months now and i had no reason to believe he was seeing/talking to anyone else up until 2 weeks ago. I noticed him getting snaps from a girl, which wouldn't bother me he talks to other girls on snap and has never bothered to turn his phone away when answering. But this girl he has a snap streak with and will answer all his other snaps but not hers in front of me. He obviously replies when I'm not around bc of their streak and it's emotionally wrecking me. I haven't been this insecure and paranoid since 2020 when I discovered my boyfriend had been cheating on me the whole relationship specifically on snap. I don't want to mess up the chill chemistry we have but I can't handle not knowing what's going on. I looked her up on Instagram and she is 100% her type and better looking than me,  face and body. I feel nauseous and self hatred and want to cut into my skin to dig out this horrible feeling.	galacticat12	post	21.246514037129497	female	White	0.9981701374053955	na	na	na	1	selfharm
"Right. I know i can't help much, but i hope you don't cut. Self harming is never the answer even though you think or want it to be. 

I suggest maybe you talk to him? Say whats going on in your mind. Does he know what happened in the past? A relationship (sometimes even a situationship) needs communication. You can't kep this to yourself especially since its destroying you. I understand you don't want to mess up the chill chemistry to the relationship but you don't deserve to feel this way and he needs to know this. And how you're feeling. Don't bottle it up. You may be over thinking it, you may not be but getting answers could help.

"stuff like this is complicated, but with people threatening to self harm if you leave them, just leave. leave before they do anything. that's on them. it is not your fault. it is theirs. block them on everything and give them no way of sending you anything, so even in the chance they do act on what they're saying, they can't show or prove it to you, which completely ruins their plan. plus, if they do actually do it, you won't even know. anyway, anything they do is because OF THEM. they are in control of what they're doing. they are in control of cutting themself. it's not your fault if they cut because of anything you've done. i said it on my previous comment, they're trying to exploit and manipulate you.

 if you do block them, if you're using an app or something, try and see if you can disable friend requests or incoming messages from strangers for a little bit. like, discord for example, you can completely turn off friend requests and/or messages from people you don't know or don't have connecting mutual friends. do that. if you block them, there's a chance they're gonna get new accounts to add you and try and manipulate you more, but you can disable that feature altogether and inevitably they'll stop. you can do this!"	doumasan_______036	reply	na	na	na	0.999457061290741	weak	no	no	na	selfharm

It’s largely a myth- actually dying that way is extremely difficult and painful, in reality it’s pretty much just the same as cutting sideways- regardless though you should avoid it entirely it’s not worth harming yourself in that way	Both_Arm1232	reply	na	na	na	0.016636962071061134	no	no	no	na	selfharm
No, people only say that because bleeding out from slitting your wrists is more likely when a larger surface area of an artery is damaged.	Both_Arm1232	reply	na	na	na	0.016636962071061134	no	no	no	na	selfharm
It doesn't cause suicide? Suicide is an attempt, harming to end your life. If you mean causing death, then from my understanding, it's a higher risk of cutting along the veins which makes it harder to stop the bleed.	Both_Arm1232	reply	na	na	na	0.016636962071061134	no	no	no	na	selfharm

It's been a while. Ngl I've already put in a little scratch and thankfully I don't really have anything that will do anything bad enough for like stitches but I'm just frustrated cause I can't put a finger on why or how I'm feeling that's gotten me back to this point. I use tattoos as motivation and it's helped a lot. I really want to get a sleeve done next year but like I just wanna slice it open again and honestly I can't tell why. Like I've been doing OK I think. It's been building up for a few nights now and today I'm like fuck it I just want to bleed. I've been using websites like fataltotheflesh.com which btw it's pretty good. But like it's not enough rn.

"I think it’s normal.  It’s a coping technique that is old and familiar, even for how harmful it is.  Just like how sometimes we fall into childish ways of self-soothing (snuggling with a stuffed animal, coloring, watching old movies and tv shows from childhood) that worked when you were a kid, we also get tempted to go try those maladaptive coping techniques that we used to fall into - the self harm, the substances.  It’s an addiction like any other.  
  
Do whatever you can to resist.  It might just cause a little slip and then you’re fine, but it can also cause a full relapse, and you have too many years behind you to risk that.  Try to give it some thought - what is going on right now that makes you want that sensation/feeling?  What could give you something similar?"

"I went to a Psychiatrist finally. I went blank and started talking about childhood trauma and suddenly it escalated to me talking about my siblings traumas too and how I think everything is fu-ked up. The psych told my mother everything. I am planning to apply to medical school this year, and she said how will I manage if I am this unstable to be a doc? Is this the right path for me, can I really do it? Also asked if I sh for attention and all. That hurt a lot. Because it's my dream and I've struggled against so many fricking odds to get that, into medical school. Doesn't my ability to hold on, stay clean of sh, and trying my best to study despite everything amount to something? 



I've been sh-ing since a few years by now. I truly thought getting help would be good. However all I got out of it is shame. By the entire family, and the psych. I've always been open to therapy or medication and everything. But I get it now why people do not go, do not open up, and don't get help. I haven't hurt myself since going there. 


I'm going to do my best to be mentally stable from now on. I'm not going to open up to my friends. I'm not ever going to talk about my scars. I'm going to just keep trying to be consistent in my work and keeping myself as stable as possible. I'm going to work my hardest to get out of this house, get financially, mentally, emotionally stable. Someday I might try getting help again.

"I’m a woman in her 20s, I’m so done wearing short sleeves as almost every time I do someone points it out. Not even people I know. Sometimes I’m sitting next to someone in a lobby or getting blood work done or whatever I may be doing that day and the person usually asks what happens it’s not in a mean way or anything, they just put me in the spot and I can’t think straight. I had this older lady I saw her look at my arms and move a seat away from me 🤪.  I usually tell them I get itchy a lot , which is true I scratch really deep and it looks like burns up and down my arms. But my god, does it make me insecure when someone points it out. The ones who don’t usually give that quick little glance across my arms. I feel embarrassed and ashamed of myself.  And I can’t wait for winter  and I can wear long sleeves without it being 100 degrees outside. I’m thinking of getting a sleeve tattoo but I gotta heal up a bit.  Anyone else have people pointing out their scars nearly every time you wear short sleeves?

Throwaway, but this had been bugging me a lot. I SH for three years. It started with pulling my eyelashes out, then to scratching my skin and then eventually lead to cutting. I’m not sure if this will make much since to y’all but I never cut deep enough to leave a mark, the thought of having to explain scars terrified me. Fast forward to a couple months ago I was having a conversation with someone that lead to SH, and she said it ‘didn’t count’ if someone didn’t have scars. I know this is so childish of me but I couldn’t help but feel like all of my worries and hurt was dashed because I don’t have scars.

"This says more about her than it does about you.  
  
You know and respect your body.  You know that every scratch and cut is harm and an insult to your skin.  It is a break it its defenses.  It is damage.  You can feel it and the after effects.  It’s still at risk for infection, and it still needs time to heal.  
  
Probably one of the most toxic people someone can be in the realm of self-harm (and mental illness) is someone who feels they need their trauma, their injury, their symptoms to be the worst, deepest, most terrible thing anyone has ever dealt with.  They breed competition, the worst kind of competition, and insecurity that maybe your own trauma isn’t worthy of the way you feel.  It makes you go deeper, worse, instead of ever trying to work towards healing.  
  
In other words, if this person is a friend, be careful what you discuss with them.  If they aren’t, cut them out of your life.  Your suffering is valid.  Your coping is valid.  And your scars are valid, they’re just not for her to see."	Warm_Afternoon6108	reply	na	na	na	0.9925358295440674	weak	no	no	na	selfharm

I went through something very similar to you. I didn’t sh, but I was suicidal, on the verge of death if I had the chance. I was 15-16 years old, just recently diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder. I thought about harming myself or ending my life almost everyday. It got a little to close for comfort on some days.

I’m 21 now, and I never thought I would make it to this age. It’s feels weird and surreal, and sometimes I feel like I don’t belong here. I wasn’t supposed to make it to this age, but somehow I did.

Yeah exactly. It's unhygienic and even if the wounds are small they can still get infected. Scars out in public is always fine, but fresh self inflicted wounds for all to see is not. 1 it's not hygienic and 2 there's a difference between being comfortable in your skin showing healed SH and fresh SH. If it's healed IMO then yeah don't overthink about others seeing or being triggered, they're HEALED and not going away. But fresh SH in the open WILL trigger people and concern them.

"I know it's a lot risking exposing your self harm and I'm sorry you're having to deal with this.

The only advice I can give if trying make up foundation for scars, it's possible to put foundation on scabs but you have to be careful about it coming off and causing an open wound again. Wikihow out of everything has an article about covering scabs with foundation. I would not recommend putting foundation on fresh cuts that's asking for some sort of awful infection that won't cover well, a liquid bandaid on the fresh cuts then covered with foundation might work but I've never tried that.

A trusted sexual partner (hopefully my dom in the near future) called me in a sh spiral and talked me down from cutting more and asked if i wanted to come over for an intense pain play session to stop myself from c*tting.

There was cutting done with a scalpel and she made these beautiful patterns over my old leg scars. The experience was so beautiful and intense and i loved every minute.

"The way it feels completely varies tbh

It used to make me feel more “real”, but I haven’t had that experience for a while now 

Sometimes it brings me pleasure (not genuine pleasure/happiness, but a short-lived thing…it involves endorphins being released, iirc). Feels like 💩 (physically and usually emotionally/mentally too) afterwards 


There was this one time when I was doing it to punish myself for doing something bad, but I ended up enjoying it in an 18+ way. I knew I was a masochist with a self-harm problem, but I didn’t know the two could just combine like that 

Then sometimes it’s unpleasant the whole way through, but I accept it because I feel like I did something wrong and/or am a bad person and therefore I deserve to feel this type of pain

Sometimes I will do it and the pain will be so strong that I can’t focus on anything else. I’ll like that I’m distracted from whatever thing I was trying to distract myself from, but then the aftermath is so not worth it. Never has been worth it, and never will be tbh.

I don't know if I had reached the dermis or not. I don't know how to recognize the layers of the skin. For me, the pain depended on the times. Most of the time it hurt a little, but it was okay. But once I saw a tiny layer of skin underneath. I could see the difference in depth (it wasn't very noticeable, but I could see the difference). Usually I didn't see any difference. Just touching that part (not cutting it, just touching it) hurt extremely badly. And I understood that I couldn't go any further, I couldn't. This part was extremely sensitive, I felt the slightest touch, so it hurt a lot. It scared me, I knew if I tried with that layer of skin it would really hurt, and I didn't want to.

I can tell you my experience. I am extremely wary of leaving deep cuts, so the most I do is leave small puncture wounds from sewing needle or safety pin jabs, on my inner thighs while sitting, since that stiffens the inner thighs. The pain is transitory, but occasionally especially on my left inner thigh, where seemingly it hurts more, the pain, while on the mild side, can still last for a few days	thenuggetonfloor	reply	na	na	na	0.011338070034980774	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

"It's different for everyone, everyone has different pain tolerance. It hurts everyone even tho some may not recognize it it's still ""hurting"". We all teach our bodies differnt pains something that may hurt you may not hurt someone else and vice versa. It's differnt for person to person also in other ways such as is this pain meant to mute other pains? Even if they are mental or is it to mask how we feel? Or is it just to feel something?. I feel like there are many factors to ""does it actually hurt"" to answer your question simply. Yes. It may not hurt you as you know ""hurt"" but it does hurt especially If you've got people who know about it they may be hurting knowing it (not in a bad way but in a caring way) if that make sense.

You don't have to do anything. Maybe bandage/cover them. I've had multiple physical exams, vaccines and blood tests with healed scars, bandages & sometimes with fresh cuts with different medical staff. They won't say anything. The only thing ever said to me was 'make sure you look after those' or telling me I should have gotten stitches (but the doc was a family friend). However, because it's been so long I don't remember the first time I exposed them, so idk how that went. I don't think they ever told my mum, although my mum always knew. I haven't been booted off to a facility either, so I wouldn't worry about that.	_PatheticGay_	reply	na	na	na	0.9991219639778137	weak	strong	no	na	selfharm

I have an appointment with my therapist next week. I have been sh about once a week now. Should I bring this up? Has anyone else brought it up in therapy and if so, what happened? What do they do when you tell them? I have Kaiser not sure if that matters.	whosinmyparkingspot	post	37.95398050437942	male	White	0.9991676807403564	na	na	na	2	selfharm

Two weeks ago I told my therapist that I was struggling with sh and honestly it was the best decision I made. If you are lucky enough to have an amazing therapist, they won't make a big deal out of it meaning they won't shame you and will recognize it as a coping strategy. Mine asked me basic questions to get a better understanding such as, where I do it, how often, if they are superficial or deep, how I felt after I do it, if I wanted to stop, etc. She knows that something like sh isn't something that you can just quit cold turkey so she gave me some suggestions on how to deal with the urges but she also stated that I had to option to sh or not and that it was up to me. Keep in mind that of course every therapist will have a different way of approaching the situation but hopefully this can give you some idea of how it will go!

I think you should go get it checked out, but I think you might just be sick from something unrelated. A wound infection would need to have progressed quite a lot for you to feel overall symptoms. Even then, it's usually a high temperature or fever, chills and nausea. Although of course I'm not a professional and could be wrong, I doubt a sore throat has anything to do with your cuts.

"hi so i come from a family of depressed people, mom, dad, sister, brother, dog, everybody's depressed. my brother and sister are both older and, well, attention seeking. Dad's words, and mine. Their mental illness came before mine since they were older, so their experiences are what my parents faced before my experiences.

So recently I've been thinking about when my mom was talking to me one time about my SH and she really just made me feel... humiliated? Embarrassed to hell and back? She was cold, calm, apathetic, and blunt, but gentle about it. I know this is because of my siblings and she doesn't want to show too much of an emotional reaction because she thinks I'll make it a pattern if she does. (She didn't tell me that, i worked it out myself.)

and a quick edit here: It could have been more on the fact that i was upset my siblings took any first-hand experience with my mom and conditioned her to be the way she is, or it could be that i didn't want her  to know at all, so ANY response she'd give me would be the wrong one.

(She also thinks I AM my siblings sometimes. brother misused his phone? i'm absolutely gonna do that too. Siblings don't eat burgers as leftovers? clearly i'm not going to either.)

(And her reactions swayed me away from telling her in the future. after the last time i spoke to her about SH it kept happening probably over 50 more times. Still does happen. she saw me throw away my first razor which i dug back out of the trash later. She doesn't know anymore.)

so... did she go about that right right way? Am i allowed to be sad she wasn't emotional about my SH? Was that the ideal response?"	Lil-fang1590	post	22.526036896995233	female	White	0.013420463539659977	na	na	na	2	selfharm
"There’s never gonna be a universal ‘ideal’ response to sh, because we’re all different and we all want different forms of reassurance (or lack thereof) when we’re hurting. Your mom’s reaction would be exactly what I’d want, but that doesn’t negate the fact that *you* felt like she was too cold. 

Self harm is an emotional topic. It sounds like your mom did what she thought was best but in your eyes she missed the mark. That happens sometimes and it isn’t necessarily anyone’s fault, but if it bothers you then you should talk to her about it."	Lil-fang1590	reply	na	na	na	0.013420463539659977	no	no	no	na	selfharm

"TW: ED, menstruation, fat-shaming, sh

Tl:dr; medical professionals fucked me around and I'm probably gonna relapse as a way to channel the anger and hurt I feel

I'm so fucking done with the entire healthcare service right now. I live in England so while it's free healthcare, doesn't mean it's perfect.

I (25f) went to my GP end of Jan this year to tell him that my normal female functions...weren't normal. I was working in a stressful environment for about 18 months at this point and I kinda knew that stress could delay Shark week, but not stop it or alter it completely. I only went to the GP because my mom pushed me into making an appointment even though I felt fine, a little bit burned out and exhausted but I'd gotten used to that.

GP ordered a blood test, it wasn't done at the usual time of day and as a fluke my cortisol (stress hormone) levels were dangerously low. I was back and forth at the main hospital, doing more blood tests for them to say it's still low so we're referring you to a hormone specialist.

6 months later, after I left the stressful job and things had righted themselves with Shark week, I have an appointment with an Endocrinologist. The nurse takes me to have my blood pressure, height and weight taken and I specifically told her not to tell me my weight number. That's because I had an eating disorder when I was 18 and I was obsessed with numbers and didn't want to know my weight, I am a muscly girl but I don't feel unhealthy and I eat perfectly fine. What did the nurse do? Shout out my weight number to the other nurse taking notes 😡

I get called in to see this make doctor and he asks me the same questions he would have gotten the answers to if he read my file. He told me my weight and BMI, even though I'd asked him not to, and said it was on the higher end and that my headaches and irregular cycles would be fixed if I lost some weight. He also said that I would never be without stress in a job and that I need to find a way to manage the stress, by going to ""talking therapy"" which in England is essentially just phoning Samaritans. He then says to me that ""when I have kids I'll find it hard to conceive because I'm overweight"" so I looked him straight in the eyes and said ""that won't be a problem because I will not be having children"" and he just laughed it off and said I need to lose weight anyway as all my health would magically get better if I did. 

I walked away from that doctor feeling completely embarrassed and angry that he diminished my symptoms, albeit from 6 months ago, to being fat and saying ""it's all in my head"". I wasn't expecting to be diagnosed with a life changing condition, but to have my life upheaved and messed around for 6 months not knowing if I've got something genuinely wrong with me or if it was just a fluke blood test is pure fucking insanity.

So now I'm just completely done with any kind of healthcare service and if I have any problems in the future I'm just gonna ignore it and hope for the best. I've been well over a year clean but the anger and hopelessness that I'm feeling can only be channeled one way and I'm probably gonna relapse later tonight when I finally have some alone time. I didn't have an appetite anyway as a other one of my symptoms but clearly if he wants me to lose weight then I just won't eat either and relapse into my ED from years ago"	axeptcrazy	post	19.819448312147895	female	White	0.9984151124954224	na	na	na	2	selfharm
"First of all I'm sorry the nurses and doctors offended and didn't listen to you you about your boundaries with body weight and dismal of your concerns. It's insane to me doctors think losing weight and talking to a therapist will solve all problems. It doesn't. It could help but in your case you were having other issues. I'm not woman but it's weird that he was first concerned with these hypothetical children before you. Maybe I'm to harsh to doctor, I know many women who want children and healthy children at that so maybe it's been a good motivator for prior patients. Idk how healthcare works where you live but can you request a lady doctor? I know male doctors don't have as much experience with women patients and a lady doctor could more easily relate to your experiences. Idk how stress effects women on a physical level but if it wasnt stressing you to the point your body was out of whack that sounds really harsh. I do hope you have been able to feel better. 

But to the self harm. Obviously don't. Don't do it. It's really such a shit habit. Damage to the body, pain, bandages&stitches, possible infection, limiting your mobility yada yada.

"I cannot express how angry I am for you and how sorry I am on your behalf that you were treated this way - it's completely unacceptable. 

I've posted before on Reddit about how I've been spoken to and treated by people in the healthcare system and it can leave you so stunned and hurt. I know exactly what you mean about how talking therapy in the UK is basically calling Samaritans if you need any real kind of consistency or anything soon - and even that it pot luck on who you're going to get because I've been ready to hang myself and just treated like an annoyance. Calling 111 with a mental health crisis has also felt like a massive gamble. And trying to get help and/or understanding with an ED with the NHS feels absolutely impossible. I'm not knocking the NHS, it's a great service, but it needs some good improvement in some areas and a hell of a lot more funding. 

That's not to say that I haven't had some good experiences with mental healthcare through the NHS, but it's certainly not been easy and you have to constantly bang the drums and fight in your own corner.

I can imagine that you feel like absolute rubbish after this experience but trust me you're a hell of a lot stronger than you give yourself credit for. An ED is a living hell and you're surviving it!

Me and my gf are trying to help each other quit SH, but its been really difficult. both me and her have tried things like the ice cube trick, the rubber band trick, and none of the rlly work. for the both of us, we cut when we dissociate hard and are physically and emotionally numb, or when we are emotionally overwhelmed. i cut also as a form of punishment. the pain, as well as seeing blood are what give me relief. idk if this'll help with finding an alternative.

"you sound just like my girlfriend. suicidal self harmer here, also a trans guy with a partner who has your same mindset so maybe the other perspective could help. its very difficult, reassurance and loving him and listening to him helps a lot but its a temporary fix, in most cases self injury is an addiction. you can get him to stop for a bit maybe but it always comes back, professional help is highly advised but if thats not available just please try to understand him as best you can if at all possible and listen to him, sometimes its impossible to resist the urge to relapse and it helps us feel okay, and i know thats bad but thats how it is.

assuming his being trans may be part of it? a sadly large amount of us practice some form of self harm, especially assuming that he may be pre-T? the dysphoria can be a big contributing factor :( unfortunately its impossible to really change one's view on themselves but the reassurance especially from a close loved one such as yourself does help even if he may not express it or outwardly rly show that it helps. expressing stuff related to the feelings can be very hard. 

honestly the only advice i can give besides professional help from a psychotherapist or otherwise if thats not available is just listen to him and continue to love him and try to understand him as best you can if he confides in you. best of luck to you both"	Broad_Highway2555	reply	na	na	na	0.9805765748023987	weak	strong	no	na	selfharm

"I’m 16yo as well as 6months clean 2 days ago and for some strange reason the urges to sh have been so bad the past week?? The only things stopping me are my new job (as I’m required to wear scrubs with short sleeves) and the fact that my parents make it a huge deal. I’m not suicidal but I struggle a lot with anxiety and cutting relieves my stress. So maybe the reason why I feel the need to cut so bad is because of my new job?? I’m also starting college next month and that’s stressing me out too. 

I just feel so selfish because there are real people who are dealing with real problems and that’s why they cut and I’m thinking of cutting just because I can’t handle change???"	FaithlessnessLocal73	post	13.941558025824136	female	White	0.9978649020195007	na	na	na	8	selfharm
First off, your clean streak is a huge achievement, congratulations! You *are* a real person dealing with a real problem. I don't think SH urges are ever for no reason. They always imply a serious issue. Once you have a positive experience with SH, even if you only do it once and it helps you, you'll be at risk of getting urges to do it again. There doesn't have to be an obvious external factor, sometimes your brain can just crave the hormone release, sometimes you're subconsciously bothered by something, I want to SH out of boredom a lot of the time. Something's usually wrong when your mind jumps to a self-destructive coping mechanism. And you mention multiple reasons that seem very valid to me. A new job, college, pressure from your parents. That's more than enough to stress someone out, especially if it's possible you have an anxiety disorder of some kind as well. Change is terrifying for so many people and you're not selfish, weak or anything like that for struggling with it. Please try to be kinder to yourself, you deserve it. It sounds like you judge yourself so much. Feelings don't always need an explanation, they're valid as they are. It's okay to accept the situation that you don't like and try to figure out where to go from there instead of overthinking whether you even have the right to be having a hard time.

it heavily depends on the person. most people are concerned, and sometimes concern comes out as anger or fear. people generally don’t react well at first, but once they have time to adjust and process the situation they’re able to be a bit more calm. this is often a scary situation for them, too.	doyougn	reply	na	na	na	0.998542308807373	weak	no	no	na	selfharm

On the other hand my mom grabs my arms and crys about it and makes me feel like shit. She makes me feel guilty by going on and on and making me promise stuff i dont want to promise.
So it heavily depends on the person. My friends are chill about it because when we met we were in an environment where self harm was frequent.

my friends and i are a lot older than you are, but not one of them has commented on my scars/self harm. they would look, but not say anything. i think this is the best response personally, but probably not common. your friends might be sad, or scared. this is just because this could be a new thing to them that they can’t understand and aren’t sure how to react to. if any of them make you uncomfortable or upset about your self harm, please tell them how they made you feel. its really important to communicate about personal issues like this. please don’t feel obligated to talk about your self harm to them if you don’t want to, even if they ask. you absolutely have the choice to not talk about it with them.	doyougn	reply	na	na	na	0.998542308807373	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
"**It’s very subjective**

By that I mean - everyone reacts differently to self harm scars & wounds

Your parents? Likely cry, or get angry. **note**: they aren’t mad at you. If they get angry, they’re not angry at *you*. They’re angry at the fact that you feel that way. They aren’t angry that *you* feel that way, they’re angry because you *feel* that way. The fact that something, or someone, has made their child so distraught that they wound up harming themselves. They’re angry that they hadn’t helped you before you took such drastic measures. Now, they might not express this anger in a good way. They might yell at you, shout, and say things they don’t mean. They’re panicking internally, they’re scared their child might get hurt again. **it’s not personal**. It’s not *you* they’re mad at.

Friends are more complicated.
You mentioned that you’re 13 - which is an age where emotional maturity varies WILDLY. 
 
Not long ago, maybe 2 years ago, I was actually 13. My friends at the time didn’t really react at all. From day 1 I had walked with my scars out. I didn’t make an effort to hide them, because I just couldn’t care less.  I have meen SH’ing since I was 11, so overtime I just stopped caring. Hell, even my friends when I was 11 didn’t care too much.

If you’ve hidden scars for a while, your friends & the people in your surroundings will probably react to seeing them. The reason I talked about emotional maturity is because some friends might not be able to handle SH as a concept. They may distance themselves from you, because they aren’t equipped with the emotional maturity to handle such a serious subject. This, once again, isn’t a personal “attack” on you, they might just need time to themselves to grasp the subject. Having said that, if your friends are good friends, they’re not all going to “leave” you. Chances are some of them have a higher level of emotional maturity and *can* handle SH. They might get sad, scared, or mad that you’d do that to yourself. Since they’re less emotionally mature than your parents, they may not handle it as well. 

Because you ask this question, I have a feeling you haven’t talked to anyone about this yet, and I urge you to do so. There is someone in your network who you can talk to about how you’re feeling, a teacher, a counselor, or maybe a sports coach? Someone with authority to help you. Even with a psychologist & psychiatrist, I thought there was no one I could *really* talk to, but I was wrong. There was a person, and this person for me was a teachers assistant. To my surprise, had even sh’d themselves when they were a bit younger. There was actually a person who made me feel listened to, and there is someone out there who will be that person for you.

orher than that now she just acts like she doesnt know (or does and pretends not to jsut to make it worse for me so she can pity herself) and is constsntly on ym ass about how i should wear less covering stuff n shit nd jsut constanr stuff about that idk

"it's scary to think about.  I'm quite a bit older than you but I'm very lucky to have friends in my life right now who are very mental health conscious and love on me despite my SH.  my boyfriend is awesome.  my SH scares him, but I think it's more because he wants to be able to save me or help me to stop but he knows it has to be something I work through on my own.  he supports me and is there for me and honestly, that's what helps me.

it's hard to know how people will react when they find out a friend or loved one self-harms.  it scares people and that's a totally reasonable reaction to have.  but some people tend to overreact because they don't understand SH.  you're growing up in a different time than I did.

"When I was underage (13-16)…hell now that I think of it even when I was 24 (I’m 30 now) if my mom saw SH marks she would baker act me, which just further increased my feelings of anxiety/depression/self hatred etc. I’ve been baker acted 3 times in my life, all by my mother. As I am a mother now, I truly don’t think she knew what to do, but I suffered with severe abandonment issues from my dad, so by her putting me in a psych ward, with strangers who served as glorified babysitters, just reinforced my feelings of abandonment. At the same time I have met many patients in those times I wish I could find now, we definitely bonded. Since 2018 I’ve been with the same partner who understands the trauma and “betrayed” feelings that rise from being baker acted and refuses to tell my mom a thing. However sometimes I think it can be hindering for me as I can really lash out on myself in a lot of self destructive ways (since we’ve been together in 5 years I’ve had 3 legitimate attempts on my life and Ive self harmed severely in places no one will see other than him, and no one other than him knows).

All of my past visible scars are old news. I’ve been SH’ing since I was 13 and started doing more private areas after my last baker act (24). I’m 30 now.

"First, let me acknowledge that I know medicine works differently for everyone. One person's nightmare could be another person's miracle cure. I can only speak on my own experience. But, I digress...

Lately, I haven't been in the best place mentally. Honestly, I never really have been, but it has been worse than ever. It took me DECADES to work up the nerve to even remotely open up to my doctor. He proceeded to give me Lexapro. I was desperate, so I reluctantly obliged. In all fairness, it seemed to help my anxiety, even if minimal.

However, after taking it for a few weeks, I fell into the worst depression I've ever experienced. I've taken plenty of anxiety and/or depression meds in the past, but never had anything close to this reaction before. It's embarrassing when literally everyone (including complete strangers) is pulling you aside out of concern. I've struggled all my life, but I've never been so scared for my mental health. Along with other things that will remain unmentioned, I began to struggle with SH, something I've rarely even thought about since I was a teenager.

I quit the Lexapro as soon as I figured out what was going on. Hadn't touched a blade in nearly twenty years. But now, here I am, in a full blown relapse. The medicine is out of my system, but the intrusive thoughts are still there. I feel so stupid, because I should know better at my age. But I can't control how I feel. Relatively speaking, I'm better now, but I'm still worse off than when I started. I regret ever saying a word, and have lost all trust in the medical profession, which was minimal from the start. How are you supposed to seek out help (or even want it, for that matter), if you can't even trust the professionals to understand? Mental health is not a game, and I'm tired of being a pawn in Big Pharma's immoral racketeering scheme."	rustydildo69	post	33.88639701204945	female	White	0.9981075525283813	na	na	na	1	selfharm

This was about 10 years ago now but it still bothers me. I cut too deep for the first time, it had a pulse and didn't stop bleeding after hours so I had to get stitches. The whole thing was traumatic enough and I hated having to admit to my mum what had happened. But when they stitched it, they didn't numb it? It was agony, and I get the irony of that considering hours earlier I'd intentionally caused myself pain, but this was a totally different type of pain and not in my control. There was a nice dr (possibly nurse but I think dr) who let me squeeze her hand and I could tell I'd hurt her hand afterwards. I'm in the UK on the NHS. Is this meant to be some sort of deterrent from cutting again? If so it didn't work, just made me less willing to go to the hospital for SH. I only had three stitches but each one they kept saying would be the last and each one was horrendous having a needle pulled through my open cut	-Daunting	post	33.18907637004217	male	White	0.9991480112075806	na	na	na	7	selfharm
Unfortunately some providers don’t give local anesthetic to self harmers due to bias & stigma. I wouldn’t say it’s normal but it happens more than it should and I have PTSD from a similar experience. They likely thought that because you already gave yourself an injury that you can handle the pain and/or deserve pain as a deterrent/perceive you as attention seeking. That doesn’t make it okay at all, it’s arguably unethical and they should’ve given you numbing.	-Daunting	reply	na	na	na	0.9991480112075806	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
Yup, I’ve been to the hospital several times and this is exactly what I mean when I say there are SO many in the medical profession who DO NOT understand. I have been flat out refused a numbing agent (I was 18 at the time) said “well you did it to yourself, why worry about anymore pain” . I was quite flabbergasted and annoyed but sucked it up (couldn’t help the tears were coming) never looked the doctor in the eyes after that. I just spoke with the nurse afterwards and gave her my humble opinion, to my surprise she was very apologetic and said she would speak with him.

That was very wrong of the professional that stitched you. It’s standard protocol to use some form of numbing agent like lidocaine and sometimes a very small amount of adrenaline to help with the bleeding.	-Daunting	reply	na	na	na	0.9991480112075806	no	no	no	na	selfharm

"Same thing happened to me when I was hospitalized. 
I hurted myself and needed stitches, it was late in the night when I told a nurse what I did and then she called a doctor to stitch my wounds. I was asleep and then been awake by the pain but luckily I only had 3 stitches but it was enough to make me feel the pain. Even if it was not ""enough"" to get anesthetize I do not think it's normal and ethical to make tour patient endure even a quick time pain, as med they have to take care and be careful to not hurt their patients.

I've had to get stitches twice and was numbed the first time. It was an accident, I fell on my face on ice lol. When I cut too deep I don't think they numbed it.

I can’t go out, I can’t do anything. I’ve been screaming a lot but I have neighbours and my thoughts are out of control. I cut my face and I’ve not done that before but it’s the thoughts and life I guess. There is no help that would work or has worked and I’m so worried because it is my face. Daily cutting because my head tells me to even tho it’s not happened like that as much as this before. All my friends are trying their bests but they’re not mental health professionals. I’m anxious a lot lately and I’m worried I’m going to get evicted, blood on the walls and stuff. I’ve done everything I’m supposed to do with services and it’s not helping.

"Yesterday I was hanging out at a friend’s house with a few other of my friends. We were just doing whatever and just staying up cause why not? I was sitting by the kitchen counter and kept getting this weird empty feeling and I was drawn to relapsing again. I have a razor in my bag and I kept thinking about going back to it. I recently threw away 430~ days so i wasn’t concerned about starting over again. I eventually broke away from my group of friends in the living room and went to go hide away and relapse. I felt immediately bad about it. I hid it from everyone else obviously. I went back to the living room after I did it and we all just kind of winded down. 2 of us fell asleep while me and one of my best friends stayed up and watched tv. I eventually dozed off. When I woke back up, I was still groggy.

Because I was so sleepy still, I didn’t realize my sleeve rolled up and my friend slowly pointed at it but he didn’t make a big deal out of it. He had known about me doing sh prior to yesterday. He said “Naughty…” in this joking kind of way when he saw it. Which made me feel a combination of ease and stress.  I tried to hide my face from him which was easy cause he’s a very susceptible to distractions so he didn’t know that I was hiding my face from him. I tried to cry but I couldn’t. For whatever reason I am unable to. 

I took my head back up and started watching tv with him again and I got the  thought to tell him I was sorry for what I did. It was so hard to work up the courage to tell him. When I did, he told me “It’s okay.” and it was just really sweet to hear those words I think. I had to leave and he told me that none of them wanted me to leave and we hugged before I left. 

It was just something else to hear words like that. I’ve had people point out my self harm before but they wouldn’t say anything about it or ask how I was. They would just kind of awkwardly point and move on. He did it differently somehow. It felt like he tried to make me laugh or feel better. I’m glad I have him in my life."	lustigerSkelettmann	post	24.56486010420549	female	White	0.0013062010984867811	na	na	na	1	selfharm

"For several months now I’ve been hitting myself when I feel I need too in my thighs. This can range from once a day to like every 20 mins. But last week I was having one of the worst days and I think I hit too hard. Didn’t hold anything back and gave a nice solid punch. Next morning I woke and realized my left knee, the area below the knee cap and right above the start of the shin, was numb. It doesn’t hurt, isn’t swollen, and hasn’t changed in appearance at all. I’m really skinny and don’t have much cushion on my thighs, so I’m worried I hit too hard and did something to a nerve? I hit in the middle of my thigh, on top. 

Honestly I have no clue what happened, if I caused it or not. Never had anything like this happen before. But it’s been like this for 5 days now, with little to no improvement. Any ideas?"	SpewingFlowers	post	36.192347252909954	male	White	0.999090313911438	na	na	na	3	selfharm

I wish they cared in better way than what it already is, I stay quiet ab anything bad bc Ik they will be like “oh here she goes again with her problems is what is it THIS TIME” and my sister who’s the middle child I’m the oldest said , I’m self-centered, delusional, and selfish bc of my sh and depression. And I take away “attention” from her due to my mental health by our mom. I never wanted attention. All I wanted was mental support. And I can’t even get that so I was a mess bc I can’t get help and my sister hated me for that and my mom is stressed bc of it so now I stay quiet ab all the bad things and suffer in silence.

"This sister of yours is acting as a 7yo child. I would say ""hope it's a child"", but may be just a blind person, I guess. My family... is a long and chaotic story, starting with the fact I'm not the only one in the house with mental health issues.

I think it's normal when parents (in this case, mothers) act this way. Parents who care feel desperate when think about losing their kid, so most of times their reaction is not exactly the best. 

About your friends, I don't know if they are real friends at all. If they can't understand you, it's not friendship. You can find mental support in someone else; maybe true friends (in case you can't afford a therapist). However, people who only stay by your side when you are fine, but leave you when you show your flaws... Surely it's not a friend.

But I'm sure you are able to make real friends. At least, I hope. I don't think you have a villain vibe pushing away everyone around you. Somehow, we made through yesterday. We survived until now.

It also depends how skilled you are at with makeup- I hadn't ever used makeup before this, so it was a really poorly done: if my scars were anywhere near new I would probably have been screwed.

"Hey everyone, 

I'm new to reddit but have often listened to and heard stories from here and irl.  I'm a 25 year old male who has also had a lot of issues in the past with SI/AS and SH.  I'm mainly here to help if anyone is currently having issues and share some ways I've helped myself.  
My primary way that I get these ideas and plans out of my head is by writing. By no means am I any good but I've shared this with a couple people and it has helped them by doing similar, whether painting/drawing or something else creative. Try it out and let me know your thoughts.  And just remember at your lowest there is always someone you can turn to for help even if it is hard to ask.
I have more, but I don't know how this one will be viewed so I'll start here


(Note: this is not a Suicide note, this was something I wrote to clear the dark thoughts I was having in my moments of struggle)

This ""poem"" (I'm not sure lol) is called -My Self Depreciating Suicide-

I lay here awake at 3 in the morning staring at the ceiling of a dark room.  I listen to the ambient sounds of creatures outside my window, the whistling of the refrigerator water, and feeling my heartbeat in my chest.  My ears ring in misery hearing these sounds scattering my brain to the four corners.  And as I feel my heartbeat the only thoughts that run through my head are though I wish it would stop to a screeching halt.  Why do I lie awake at night having these thoughts race through my head. Could it be this is what I truly wish upon myself or is it the pitch black piercing through my heart.  I find it hard to sleep with such few sounds and in such a dark place.  And yet when the sun shines and the world wakes up is when I feel like I can finally rest.  Night and Day, light and dark, stop and start, death and life, all of these are two sides of the same coin I don't even want to even to carry it anymore.  My brain feels scattered and my heart feels torn but full of stitches, my arms feel broken but still trying to reach out for someone to hold even though there's no one left.  Being here on the edge I feel as though life is nothing more then two steps from death.
   Goodbye my scattered brain to the pain I think, tattered heart I so carelessly tried repairing, broken arms always failing to reach out, goodbye all.

"In the interest of sharing stories and poetry, I'd like to add my own. Just as the OP mentioned, this poem is by no means a suicide note. In fact, I'm happy to say that I've been self-harm free for 300 days at the time of writing. It's interesting though to reflect on the past of my journey, and to share my story with others.

*Can I do this again?*  
*Will I make it this time?*  
*Another day of rain?*  
*A little bit more pain?*  


*My eyes are sore and dry.*  
*Yet I still somehow cry.*  
*Those crimson drops of mine.*  
*It's a foreboding sign.*  


*The warmth of life, another spurt.*  
*A searing kiss, a love that hurts.*  
*A sense of calm, inside my mind.*  
*Feigning control, that leaves me blind.*  


*An inner strength is welling up inside me.*  
*With every drop, my vision sharpens to see.*  
*A path to heal, those feelings that torture me.*  
*Regaining clarity through my unique artistry.*  


*Drawn to the blade like a moth to a flame.*  
*A soldier, I am, fighting my terrors away.*  
*One more shriek, one more breath.*  
*Living a life of stinging regrets.*  


*Washing my pain with sanguine tears.*  
*Let it all out, despite my fears.*  
*I know nothing - but what I am.*  
*A canvas of my end, a visage of the dead.*

Healing isn't linear. I'm proud of you for making it to 3 months! A relapse doesn't take that away, try not to beat yourself up. For now, you only need to take care of yourself physically and mentally. Do something nice for yourself if you're able to, it's like an opposite action for being unsatisfied with yourself. You don't have to hurt yourself further in your mind after hurting your body. There'll be time to reflect on the situation and maybe even learn something from why it happened, but you can do that when the most intense guilt and any other negative feelings associated with relapsing get a little more manageable. You can get back on track, I believe in you.	haerinzuu	reply	na	na	na	0.9994433522224426	weak	no	no	na	selfharm

I'm so sorry about that, that's a horrible reaction. It sucks when someone finds out when you're not ready to tell them (or if you never want to tell them, especially when you can predict they won't take it well). This is about you, not about them. No parent should ever put this burden on their child, generally no one should ever use suicide as a threat.

"Ok so it’s really hard to hit a bone even with a sharp knife you would’ve had to get through multiple layers. You would’ve had to cut the same cut over and over for a pretty long time.
Even then it’s hard to hit a bone.
Put bandaids on it and if it’s still bleeding you need to put pressure on it. Take an ibuprofen it helps against infections and inflammations so it’ll help with healing.
Try not to rub it with clothes and sometimes when you got the time: let it be and fresh air. Skin needs air to heal!
If it won’t stop in 2-3 days to hurt like that you should go to a doctor.

Also maybe look if it’s already infected(warm, red area around it and probably yellow-ish puss that comes out) if it is already infected: do not wait to go to a doctor!!!! You could get blood poisoning which could eventually lead to death or loosing your leg if completely untreated(Now don’t panic it’s not always the case but if it gets infected you should defo see a doc).

"Honestly? 

Tattoos - for when it gets so bad I could just use anything to hurt myself and find relief even though I’d likely regress and regret it. 

Delta 8/CBD/THCA/Etc - I find in moderation that smoking can help with general anxiety, wellness, and depression if consumed responsibly and in a method that works best for the individual. Especially considering mental health. Always safety first. 

Family time - even when it sucks it reminds me of a one of the major reasons why I am here and not desirous, very often - if at all these last 6 months, of killing myself. 

Developing Friendships - Having people around that actually care about my well-being. No longer just being the person who checks on people. Now people see what’s Umbra doing! Where’s He been? etc. it felt like invasive and unnecessary at first because there were undertones of worry and fear about my wellbeing for so long. 

But now. It’s a total different experience and when it gets awkward instead humor is met with compassion and growth. 

Realizing, across the board, everyone suffers and the only option we have in that regard is whether we choose what causes our suffrage and is the outcome desirable to us. 

I enjoy the small moments - this one’s darker - when I accidentally stub my toe, or nick myself I don’t relish in the act of it occurring but I allow myself space to enjoy the pain itself. Because for me with SH I enjoy the pain and after care aspects the most. It’s like a sick twisted way of caring for myself but not addressing the actual issues at hand. 

I accept that any growth is a win.

I generally try to stay optimistic and when I’m in a really dark place let someone who loves me know. So that after three days of unresponsive they don’t freak out. But five - now that’s weird, haha. Let’s go pull Umbra back into the world. He’s gone full hermit. 

Most of the time I’m rather out going and sociable. 

What keeps me from self harming is a myriad of things. Idk how to tell you some secret to getting rid of the itch for it. 

But I’d be down to talk and maybe look at what you are going through and contributing to in your life and we can start there to make realistic advantageous decisions that create a better living experience.

Being too tired/sleepy, being around people, when the skin is too rough and it won't cut easily,   porn, video games, drawing, losing myself to daydreams about feeling better (or worse), and music kinda keeps me from sh for a while i guess.

"Yeah yeah, infections, it hurts, it'll scar and be hard to hide...

But god I can't rationalize myself not to do it, it can't be that bad if it's not deep or just a small scratch. I feel like I can't stop thinking about it till I do it.  


I've tried drawing over my skin, pinches but it's not making the thought go away.

The scars I’m having issues with were made in October of 2022. I had 52 stitches for them, one was fascia, the rest were fat. They took forever to heal. When they were healing, I had weird sharp pains all up and down my forearm (where they are), but I thought, they’re just healing. Well, it persists. They are healed over now, but they are puffy, and I can see blood vessels through them. It’s like, the smallest thing touching them sets it off, even my own arm hair. It feels like an ant with knives for legs is crawling around inside my arm. It’s very annoying. Literally nothing helps. I’ve tried numbing creams, it doesn’t help. I’ve tried slapping my arm, itching it, Ice, fucking nothing works. It’s very annoying and triggering. Does anyone have any advice? I could bring this up to a doctor but my mom wouldn’t be happy with me and she thinks I’m over exaggerating. Thanks!

"I'm thinking maybe a tubigrip or bandage to protect the skin from rubbing on things. Even though the skin is healed, the scars will still be healing and will eventually toughen up and become less sensitive.

so i've been cutting for a couple years now, was sober for 2, relapsed like 3 or 4 months ago. i feel into it hard, been doing a lot of cuts on my thighs. one day i was really angry at myself, and i ended up slashing my arms for the first time. i cut rlly deep, close to the fat layer. ive been covering the wounds with a bandage roll (ran out) and its been 3 or 4 days. i initially had it covered with makeshift bandages made from a cotton shirt, then switched to a bandage roll. everytime i swap the bandages out daily, they stick to the scabbing on the wounds and end up ripping off the scabbing when i swap them. is there a better bandaging or way to treat it so it closes quickly? i cant go to the hospital.

Soak the dressing in water before changing it and it shouldn't rip off as much. You can apply some Vaseline around the edges of the cuts to prevent sticking. Deep cuts can take a while to scab over, sometimes even a week for me, so as long as they don't get infected, they should heal okay. You can get some steri strips in case you need to help a wound close up faster in the future.	Glittering_Win_1048	reply	na	na	na	0.9964122176170349	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
i just did that and omg THANK YOU! it barely ripped off. i dont have any more bandage roll. i dont have vaseline, but i have a&d ointment, would that work? my neosporin is expired. i really appreciate it a ton.	Glittering_Win_1048	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9964122176170349	weak	strong	no	na	selfharm
I think A&D is okay for very minor wounds, it might not be the best for cuts. It would definitely be great for moisturizing them when they're healed. Many medical products are still good for a few years after expiration, so maybe you could still use the Neosporin. I think the worst that can happen will be that the antibiotic component won't be effective anymore, and when you take that away, it's pretty much like Vaseline. I doubt it will harm you. Of course I'm not a professional though.	Glittering_Win_1048	reply	na	na	na	0.9964122176170349	no	no	no	na	selfharm

It would definitely be a good idea to get some bandages or bandaids if you can. Pads or clean fabric can work too, they're just not as practical. Four years is a pretty long time, but I still don't think Neosporin can really get harmful when expired. I could be wrong though.

"It definitely can, especially if you cut often or the wounds bleed/reopen for a while. It takes the body [a while](https://biobridgeglobal.org/donors/how-does-blood-regenerate/) (6 to 8 weeks per pint, although you're hopefully not losing that much) to replenish the blood you lose so if you sh often it can start to add up. You also run the risk of nicking a vein or artery, which can cause a LOT more bleeding than you're expecting and can get out of control very fast.

You know your body better than anyone on the internet, though. It'd be a good idea to keep track of your anemia symptoms (maybe keep a journal?) and see how much you actually feel when it comes to symptoms. Might also be worthwhile to make a safety plan in case you DO get sudden symptoms while self harming, like making sure you keep your phone nearby in case you're too dizzy to stand to get it, or having a list of people you can call if you feel faint.

"So basically ever since i came out about this whole self harming thing to my mother two years ago, she asked me 

""Do you think about me? About what i feel when you do this?"" 

And that made me think that she's gone crazy, like actually crazy, how could i think about that while im hurting?

Anyways, today i relapsed for the first time since late April, because of my mom, and she eventually found out, i eventually lost my mind and started screaming at her for all of the things she's done to me, for example mentally abusing me, body shaming me even though im a healthy weight, and she's the overweight one, and much more.

One of the things she said was ""Well, if I'm divorcing your father am I supposed to cut myself and jump off a 9 story building?"" (reference to my failed suicide attempt at only 11, also because of her and my father's abuse) She told me that ""I'm a selfish piece of shit, because at every inconvenience i self harm"" I tried to explain to her that it's an addiction since i was 11 years old, and that this is my way to cope with my emotions (spoiler she didnt belive that).

I'm a minor. I thrive for the day i graduate high school and move out of this shitty household, the amount of times suicide has gone through my mind is insane, luckily my boyfriend tries his best to make me forget about self harm, although i sometimes don't listen and do it anyway because i can't take it anymore. Today, August 13th 2023, is my new starting date, starting my recovery journey again for the god knows what time, I'll try my best to not give into the urge, sinxe my mother threatened me that if i do that again I'll have to move in with my dad, outside of the city.

You're not selfish at all for struggling with self harm and mental health. Parents are meant to support their children, to comfort them, to do anything they can to help them. This often involves setting aside their own emotions, their own hurt about their children's struggle, in order to be there for them. If she's upset about your your self harm, that should be something she talks about to a peer, a therapist, etc. in a way that helps both of you. Instead, she's making you responsible for her emotions and insulting you, when you're dealing with severe health issues. She's abusive, and she's guilting you when you need support and love.

One thing I will say my love, wherever you go, you take yourself. If you are having internalized struggles/demons, you will deal with them when you are on your own. I had similar struggles as a teen, a dismissive mother who called me a drama queen when I had legitimate life attempts. As an adult I still struggle tremendously. This is not to say that if you remove yourself from a toxic situation, you will be better off… This is merely to say if you struggle internally you have to deal with that yourself and find a place of healing because it never just happens.

Wtf. No, you are not the selfish one here, you just have awful Parents. Im not saying that cutting is good, but its absolutely not your fault. I dont know how old you are, but move out as fast as you can. Dont talk to your Parents about it, just do it. Once your 18, find a roommate to get an Apartment with, once all the legal stuff has Been cleared and you got a contract and can legally live in the Apartment, get your mates to your home, let Them help you move your stuff and make sure your Parents dont pull Any funny business and go. Once you moved out your Parents have no more right to decide over anything about you, or even have contact with you. Should they appear at your door you can legally call the cops On Them if they refuse to leave. TL;DR: Get as far away from these people as possible.

"Self harm and why we do it isnt a one size fits all. 

Some people genuinely like the pain.
Some don't like the pain but find that they deserve it. 
Some donut out of angry impulse. 
Some may do it to feel SOMETHING.
Sometimes it's a punishment. 
It's a way to cope. 

What you're experiencing isn't strange at all when it comes to sh. Not everyone gets the rush of relief. You're just as valid though. 

Hear me out. My self harm changes. Sometimes it's to deal with emotional pain. When I'm going through too much, I can go cut and while I don't feel ""better"" I feel relief of some kind. 

Other times, I will feel so rejected by the world and a number of just awful things and I'll punish myself with pain. There is... A sense of relief? But my sadness and misery feels heavier when I do it this way. 

This is a very complicated thing that we all experience. There is no one way it looks. No one size fits all. I will definitely say though that I think that your post is so important.

At first for me it definitely didn’t feel good , however recently the pain I get from sh does actually make me feel good -it’s weird but the tingling sensation I get makes me feel at peace and calms me down , I guess it could be from the fact that it feels like a physical release of built up emotions or maybe as a comfort thing as it’s acted as a distraction and a coping mechanism from my issues - like it’s the only thing I know will actually calm me down and focus my brain after lots of built up stress	bigyellowman2	reply	na	na	na	0.9994913339614868	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

Sometimes sh somewhat satisfies the suicidal/negative thoughts i have been having all day or for days.

I'm seriously going to try and quit. I don't want to be fighting this forever, and I can't just keep sitting around without actually trying. I've been cutting almost daily for a while now, and have been getting the urge to cut deeper and hurt myself worse, but I know nothing good will come if I continue down this road. Tomorrow I'm going to throw my blades out in the outside dumpster so I can't just dig them out of the trash can because I know I would. I know I need to find a different outlet to get all this shit out, but I'll figure it out as I go. I can't keep relying on self harm to feel better, I'm honestly just scared to let go of it though because it's all I know. I don't know how to feel better or relieve my negative thoughts and feelings without cutting, and it's fucked, but the least I could do is try.	random-user27	post	12.887893788975106	male	White	0.9984961748123169	na	na	na	3	selfharm

But having been clean for 5 years (did it once all that time) I want to tell you it will probably not matter after a while. You cut or not, feels both empty.

Do not do it, please. Let the anxiety take over if you have to. I’m serious. I’ve suffered through panic attacks on-and-off for over 13 years and the only way to stop them is to tell your brain that they’re just feelings and that even if you have a PA you’re going to be ok. Your brain tells you otherwise, but you are going to be ok. You’re not going crazy. You’re not having a heart attack. It’s simply a misfiring of your fight or flight responses. I’ve been there, friend. You’re not alone, and you’re not in any danger. (Except the danger you pose to yourself). I’m not just some random internet person that can’t relate to you. *I am you*.

"I had been clean for nearly a month and I just relapsed yesterday. For a very stupid reason in my eyes.

I have this friend in theather classes and he's a really nice guy, he always manages to cheer me up even when I'm at my lowest. He's really shy and hadn't ever really opened up to someone before until I showed up, and I'm glad I could make him feel better and comfy to trust me with his problems. This confidence and close relationship made me really start crushing on him, and by the looks of it, I thought he shared the feeling. When I confessed to him, it was pretty much the opposite. He wasn't rude or anything about it, which makes this story even more ridiculous. After telling him I was alright and that everything would stay the same, I snapped.

"People that have talked to me about it always say don't do it, it's not worth it, please don't ect. but I still don't have a reason why I shouldn't. I don't understand what's so wrong about me doing it. I'm only hurting myself so it doesn't matter. I get why other shouldn't and that they are hurting themselves, but I just can't apply the same logic to myself. I get that some people might be hurt if they find out but that's why I don't tell anyone. Even then it's not their fault and I don't get why they would care. The pain is temporary so I just don't see what's so bad about me doing it.

Also this is not me endorsing sh, im just confused. if you are sh-ing or thinking about it, please try to find some other outlets <3"	_PatheticGay_	post	13.62075269116778	male	Hispanic	0.005336012691259384	na	na	na	13	selfharm
I feel in a way you answered your own question. You said, “if you’re actively sh-ing, or thinking about doing so, please seek another outlet.” That’s the kind of positivity you should try feeding yourself, if that makes any sense. The biggest reason I can give you as to why it’s bad and why you shouldn’t is simply because of how unhealthy it is as an outlet. I don’t believe anyone should have unhealthy outlets and should always strive to better themselves. And if possible turn their own pain into something constructive that can help someone else. It’s the very thing that keeps me coming back here, because I want to help others see my point of view. I battled with sh for over a decade and am now 5 months clean after I ended up in the ER getting 15 stitches. I look at myself in the mirror and I picture the child me. She doesn’t deserve to be physically hurt. Try picturing yourself as someone else. You said you know others shouldn’t sh but you can’t apply that same logic to yourself. Which I completely understand because it took me a very long time to break through that. But I believe that’s the breakthrough you should seek. It took my only remaining grandparents on my moms side seeing me for the first time in a long time to put things into perspective for me. Their precious granddaughter, with an entire left arm now covered in scars. Bad ones too. It broke them. And in turn it broke me. One day I finally made the decision to seek healthier outlets. And put in the genuine hard work on my perspective and mental health. I hope all of this babbling helps you in some way. And if no one’s told you lately, you’ve got this. I believe in you. Best of luck to you and all you set out to accomplish <3	_PatheticGay_	reply	na	na	na	0.005336012691259384	no	no	no	na	selfharm
"It's wrong, because you matter.  I don't mean that generically.  I mean it literally, in ways you probably don't understand.  You, your life, your feelings.  You matter.  In the grand scheme of things.  On a planetary scale.  You matter.  Most of us don't realize it, many of us can't.  

This world is full of darkness.  It surrounds us, assails us, assaults us, tries to drag us down, tries to overwhelm us.  Saved it doesn't win through one climactic battle.  That's only in movies.  In real life the dark is patient.  It understands that every single victory matters, no matter how small.  Every argument, every fight, every lost friend, every unanswered thank you, every unheld door, every rude comment, and every cut.  It all adds up, bit by bit, over time, adding up day after day, and when all the dark outweighs all the light, day after day, month after month, we slip further away.  We slip further down.  

But the same is true for light.  Every thank you, every please, every smile, every helping hand, every kind gesture or word.  They add up too.  Every little bit you do to help someone can change their day, and for those of us who've fallen so far, it's the little things that matter.  The little gestures the little helps the little words and little kindness.  As long as there is light in you, then you matter.  You hurting yourself matters.  It matters more than you know.

We do horrible things to ourselves just to make it through.  I know that.  I've been doing this far too long but I'm far too deep.  But I see more than most because I've been here, down so deep, sitting at the very edge for so long.  You matter.  I promise you that you do.  Your life, your light, your thoughts and feelings.  They matter.  

Do what you have to, to survive.  To endure.  Even this horrible thing we do.  But it's a short term solution for long term problems.  It isn't the answer.  It isn't the solution.  It won't fix us.  It will fail us all in time.  You matter.  Every time you cut yourself, that darkness matters.  It adds to your whole.  It tricks you, promises you comfort, offers you relief, but it's temporary.  It's double edged.  You matter.  So please be careful.  Please don't look down on your self.  Please don't underestimate yourself.  If you don't at least believe in yourself, how can anyone else?"	_PatheticGay_	reply	na	na	na	0.005336012691259384	weak	no	no	na	selfharm
to others who don't SH, those *are* reasons not to SH, and logical ones at that.  but to those who SH, those aren't reasons at all, especially when there are those of us who can't fathom living without the aid of SH.  the way I try to explain it to others is by thinking about something in their life that they can't possibly live without...whether it be coffee or running or painting or writing or whatever it is...that's what SH is for people.  especially when you're so active in it.	_PatheticGay_	reply	na	na	na	0.005336012691259384	no	no	no	na	selfharm

Cutting is like headphones or like a flashlight or something. I'm just so tired of having them scream at me all the time and now I can make them stop even if it's only for a little bit.

I have to carry on a normal life, helping others who are suicidal, without them knowing that I myself am struggling hard. I carry this burden and it's too much for me to carry anymore. I can't carry around this depression, this trauma, this addiction. This is too much. It's like I'm living in the worst timeline. I'm self harming every single day and I don't know how to stop. I've literally self harmed while at work. I have been in a low point for a while now. Help me please please. I carry everyone's pain around and I just can't do it anymore. I no longer really put effort into my job, I'm just living day by day, and I'm severely depressed. The reason for my depression is my addiction, feeling of emptiness, and desire to fill the emptiness in my heart at all costs.

I’ve been dealing with self harm for a couple years now. I don’t cut myself self or anything like that. I usually hit myself in the head whenever I get upset or angry usually when I make a mistake but this time I think I took it too far. I was just straight throwing blows to the back of my head and neck  and now it’s probably been like 2 weeks later and I’m really starting to feel it. The back of my head and neck are hurting and feeling stiff. I would say I probably feel a little cloudiness towards the back of my head and I especially feel it when I smoke weed it’s like the weed helps me feel what my body is going thru even more which I guess is a good thing but also bad thing lol. I have been feeling more tired than usual now and when I lie down to sleep is when I really feel the discomfort on the back of my head and neck. Luckily I would say I haven’t caused too much damage because I’m still able to get up, do simple tasks, drive,  go to work etc but I still feel pain on the back of my head and neck pretty much the whole day . I do believe I am a little more forgetful than usual but I never had to great of a memory to begin with especially when I smoke weed lol. Honestly I’m just disappointed in myself that I really took my self harm that far but best believe I’m a get rid of this habit I’ve had enough! I believe I gave my self a mild concussion because I was throwing some pretty brutal blows to the back of my head and neck and honestly I just hope that I didn’t fuck my life up cause I know brain injuries and concussions aren’t no joke. If I don’t see any improvements in a couple of weeks I’m a go get myself checked out. If you are still reading this I appreciate it and any advice would be great. I guess I just wanted to let all of this off my chest.

"Hi me 34f an my partner 31m had the biggest argument that we've ever had! the other day he took a blunt blade from me that's like a safety blade from me I have borderline personality disorder I do self harm when I feel low enough an it stops my mind going to more extreme thoughts/suicidal thoughts! My partner has been desperately trying to make get rid of the blunt blade the past few months, to which I have refused we are I'd say in a long distance relationship 2 an a half hours on the train whilst I was home spending the week with my daughter he found it took it away.

 well the other day I couldn't find it so I asked him outright an yes he's taken it an won't give it back after the argument I left the house it was midnight and in an unfamiliar town.

 I just headed to a far away bench in the park across the street after many texts an calls which I didn't answer the calls it was an hour later I was freezing an out of my mind with anger and suicidal thoughts. he got his best Friend 25f involved she also called an text he involves her in everything I don't like it it made me more mad and of course him an her stood firm on why he did it which isn't unusual they're in a bubble together and sooo close I'm on the outside.
he text asking where I was I said a bench an then a few mins later he was there I got up an walked away an he kept getting infront of me begging and crying for me to come I said no I won't come back unless you give it to me he flat out refused.

 I kept pushing him to get away from me I've never got physical with anyone before well I was freezing an out of my mind I came back home nothing is resolved.

 more rage from me not physical but I'm mad an took a failed OD last night he doesn't know.

 altho I'm mad we still love each other an I've apologised for my behaviour he's adamant he has nothing to be sorry for. I'd calmed a little yesterday so I said sorry an that I could see his side but in my effed up brain I'm still angry an can't drop it my brain is on fire with thoughts an anger an hurt and guilt so am I in the wrong."	frizzle1989	post	23.27508588950154	female	White	0.9973410964012146	na	na	na	1	selfharm
You're not the asshole. It's rude and usually counterproductive to take away someone's SH tools. It could make someone resort to less safe ways of SH'ing.

"So I've been clean for weeks now. 
I used to cut with a pencil sharpener blade, reaching the dermis. 
The reason why that's important is because a few minutes ago I scratched my thighs with a pair of scissors. The scissors were old and blunt and the scratches didn't bleed. 
I did it because I was experiencing sadness and I must felt infuriated that I couldn't cut- so I used the scissors as a substitute.

"I started cutting a really long time ago I don't even reamber when I started. My sister started cutting a while ago. I tried to tell her to stop which is stupid because no one fucking listens to that. But like she's getting help. Thats good. It's just that It hurts in a way. I don't know how to explain it correctly. It's like I care about her and I'm happy she's getting help but at the same time I wish that was me. I wish I could also get help. I wish I could tell someone. I wish someone would actually listen And not talk over me. I want help and I don't want help at the same time. I don't think I'll get better. I want someone to look at my scars and care. I'm sorry for being selfish I just want someone to care.

I'm just gonna rant and write anything that come in my head. One time my sister did see my scars and this was when I was laughing and my trouser actually pulled up a little and she saw my cuts. I told her that it was nothing and probably a skin condition. She asked why I did it and I told her to leave me alone. She apologized later saying that she might have thought it was something else I said that It was ok. 

A few months later she asked what was I struggling with and she listed multiple things and I said no But when she said self harm I started crying. I didn't say Yes or no I just started crying. I started crying because someone finally found out. I didn't tell this to anyone not even my therapist. (I don't have a therapist anymore) Than she looked worried because she was concerned how often to I do it. I didn't tell her anything. 

Sorry If this doesn't make sense I don't know how to explain my emotions correctly.

I can relate with the desire of wanting to be cared for and loved. It can be difficult to feel loved and cared for, when you are struggling.

"Maybe this is a stupid question to ask here but I switched the blades a few days ago. They came from a cheap dollar store pencil sharpener, but I noticed unlike the previous blades, the metal from these sharpener blades turned a darker color when it came into contact with my fingers, and smelled extremely “metallic”. I started using a cotton pad to hold the blade, but there would be this yellowish residue from the blade(?) 

I clean my blades and myself before and after, so I hope it’s not a cleanliness issue. Sorry if it’s common knowledge that pencil sharpener blades aren’t made of lead or something."	Thanossenpai	post	3.807717224138372	male	White	0.9986987113952637	na	na	na	3	selfharm
I don't think they're made of lead. From a very quick Google search, I found that lead is sometimes used for heat tempering steel, but it's not inside or anything and they probably clean it off well.

"It was decently late at night and I had an okay day, I had a small argument with my dad but it shouldnt have been anything to cause me to do something like that. Its the first and only time ive ever done it.

I was using a razor I had taken out of one of those sharpeners you'd use at school, it wasnt very sharp and didnt cut very well so it took a lot of tries to get any cuts, I knew i should have stopped it when the first time i tried it didnt cut me but i kept going, when I saw the first cut it just made me want to do more and I ended up doing it until i had cut my wrist quite a lot, I couldn't feel any pain from doing it and i just kind of went into a trance. None of the cuts were very deep and they haven't left any scars as they just seemed like slightly more severe scratches. Has anyone had a similar experience? I feel like i did it purely because of the fact I had a razor available to me at the time but I have one of those sharpeners sat in my room that I haven't touched since that night."

"To the 3 people who will read this, and the 1 person who'll comment, thank you. 
Idk what to do anymore. About 10 months ago, I was at the lowest point in my life. I actively tried to k*ll myself, hurt myself in the worst ways possible, ran away from home, got sent to a psych ward and am now in a group home. I *mostly* got my feelings under control now. But I still have the occasional crisis. A little context: I'm Jamie, 14 years old and diagnosed with moderate depression, autism, ADHD and anxiety. I've typed out my life story way too many times here, so I'll give you the short version. I spent the first 6 years of my life with my grandmother, a strict christian and very manipulative. Got bullied in school (still am) for my strange behavior. And because I'm the perfect victim in general. After an incident which I will not elaborate on, my mother took me home. She's very unstable, thanks to her traumatizing childhood. Meaning, she'd often lash out in anger for no apparent reason. She was very abusive. It didn't take long for me to develop extreme anger issues because of the stress. It's a long story, in short, I'd beat up everyone and everything. I got expelled often and had to switch schools multiple times. By then, I'd start scratching and biting myself. I was only 8 at the time. Later, we'd move to Munich, with my THIRD stepfather. He was horrible, his anger issues even worse than mine. He even tried to kill me once. After a while, the anger turned into misery. I did everything I could to distract myself. I read books, watched movies, listened to music and played games. I'm doing my best to disconnect from the world. I hate everything about it. I'm actually planning on ranting about the entirety of the existence in my next post, but that's beside the point. I started cutting. I don't know why , I don't know when, I just did it. Then, I ran away. I only made it 24 hours. After what was arguably the worst time of my life, I got into contact with CPS. They told me they'd put me in a group home, in the meantime, I was in the psych ward. I won't tell you anything about that. It was just horrible. Now, I'm here. I don't know what's going on. Nothing makes sense anymore. I'm not even sad. I feel nothing at all. I hurt myself just to feel real. Pathetic, I know. I'm nothing but a problem. I wish I could just kill myself. I mean, I have a goal, but I'll never make it. I have someone to live for, but I might never see them again. I just can't do this anymore. The only good feelings I still know are finding a good song, someone telling a joke so bad that it's actually good and getting high or drunk. I need a reason to keep going. Please help me."

"I don't know if I quite count - self harmed regularly from 14-18 then only occasionally did it in college. Now I'm 24, I've only self harmed once or twice in the last year. In my mind I've completely stopped and have been ""clean"" for a long time but I guess I still do it occasionally. I don't drink or smoke or anything so maybe it's just taken over that void a bit.

At any rate, I can say it does get better but it is almost never about the self harm itself. It's mainly about you. How you're feeling, how you handle situations, etc. SH is a poor response to trauma and pain, as you grow you learn better responses that make it easier to handle those. SH tends to make it worse. 

You will get better. The urge might never go away, clearly mine hasn't, but you learn to manage the urge and be okay with it. I will say (and it might sound obvious but) you have to be the one to do it. You have to want to get better. Not saying you don't, that's just something I wish I understood better.

"I'm sorry you're dealing with all of this right now. Two years is something to be very proud of. I found focusing on the specific streaks is less helpful than focusing on trends. Have you gotten better at it in the last 3 years? Even if it's only a little better, that's a positive trend. You can't get a lot better without first getting a little better. Even if you haven't, that's okay. You work on it one day at a time (but it's a lucky coincidence because I think it even comes that way). 

And maybe the thoughts will always seep through? That doesn't mean you won't learn to handle the thoughts better. Like I said, personally, I do still think about it a lot.

But it's so freaking hard. I have the worst urges right now. I think I might have an eating disorder and that's why it was easier for me to stop self harming. Because I shifted from sh to ed. 

I really wanna relapse but I threw all of my razor blades. I wanna cry but I can't.

This could be an issue with control. I know for me if I felt really out of control in my life I’d go back to super restrictive eating, counting calories and stuff. And then recently sh as a way to have control over something. It can be really tough to not be able to release ur emotions, but I think sometimes finding out why it’s happening makes it a little easier and you can address the root of the problem. I hope things get better for you, hang in there :)	_1me_	reply	na	na	na	0.9978333115577698	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
I relapsed recently, & I need motivation to quit. Like… Everyone says sh is bad, but I genuinely don’t understand *why*. I’m probably stupid & there’s a really obvious reason that i’m oblivious to, but… I don’t cut super deep & I take care of my wounds so infection isn’t a major concern. I do it in hidden places so nobody will see the scars. Why is this such a bad thing? It’s literally the only thing that makes me feel better.	theplutosys	post	0.7252195595509647	female	White	0.007804544642567635	na	na	na	2	selfharm
I’ll try to share my perspective with you on this. Sh itself is a really negative and unhealthy outlet. It’s an addiction like many other things, alcohol, drugs, etc. Say you drink or use drugs for 10+ years. Because of how unhealthy it is and how negatively it affects your body and mental health, it will cause major major issues in the long run. It can quite literally end your life. I view sh in the same way. As a teen when I first started sh-ing it started with cat scratched in hidden places. A decade later I became an alcoholic and eventually covered the entirety of my left arm in very bad scars. I have to live with that for the rest of my life now. Just this past March I ended up in the ER getting 15 stitches. Sh made me feel better until I came home from the hospital with everyone looking at me like an injured puppy. This is just my personal experience and thoughts.. but finding a reason to stop using an unhealthy outlet would be a very good thing. And if that’s something you want to do, just know I believe in you :) I wish you the best of luck <3	theplutosys	reply	na	na	na	0.007804544642567635	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

It might be too late, if the cut has started to scab over and get stiff you’ll have a hard time getting the steri strips to hold the sides of the cut together properly.

"Some people do self harm to feel something again, they are soo sad and depressed that they litterly have no feelings or emotions so she is the only way for them to feel something again. Other people do it bc they need an dissertation,

Example: someone had an test and got the results, they got a very bad grade soo they are anxious of what their parents will react, they do self harm to ignore the feeling and to distract themselves .

Other people do it bc they think that they deserve to be in pain, they don't deserve anything nice or basic human rights. They feel like they deserve to be in pain and that they deserve only to be tortured. Self harm is the closest thing to that.

Some people can have multiple reasons at once or have different reasons every single time they do it. There are a lot of many other reasons why people do it but these are the ones I understand (and experience). Self harm is an addition, it's like cigarettes.

I always see people saying it’s to feel something or as a release etc. I’m not sure if anyone else is the same, but when I was in my worst mental states I did it because it made me feel like my pain was “real.” I grew up in an abusive household and was often gaslit, treated like I was crazy, just overreacting, etc. Before I got out I was suicidal 24/7. But that kind of pain was invisible, just in my head, and sometimes it left me feeling like maybe I WAS just exaggerating. It’s almost like creating a physical manifestation of what my head feels like. Pain that I could see and feel and that left scars often grounded me.

"Yes, it is painful but if you use sharp things, it's not that bad. Besides, it's usually about the moment, not about the pain. Due to how our body works, when we're hurt we focus mainly on the injury and us. Therefore, your entire attention is focused on you and you can forget about your depressing/unsettling thoughts.

Although, some people may do it for different reason. Such as: enjoying the pain, liking the sight of blood, seeking for (medical) attention from others or sometimes you just don't really know why.

The pain of the cut, scratching, or even my ""safe self-harms""(what my psychiatrist calls it) of piercings and tattoos are what distracts me enough to calm down and focus and breathe again.

Honestly the pain of the act itself isn't the worst part, it's the pain of the wound afterwards....when the endorphins are gone. So like when you shower or when something rubs against the wound while it's healing. That part is painful, and it also makes me feel like the smallest person.

It does hurt sometimes but most times for me it’s really not that bad at all again coming from someone with hypersensitivity and low pain tolerance but I don’t go that deep either so idk.
I’m kind of goin in circles but people who sh usually don’t like themselves so why would they not want to hurt themselves. It’s like a punishment really.
I also do it because( don’t hate me now) I’ve grown to like my scars they are like temporary tattoos and probably hurt so much less than actual tattoos, I kinda think they’re cute ON ME not other people ofc! I just have a really hard time letting go of things and they’re a part of me now. I like how they and other types of sh look I don’t like blank spaces. Like a reflection of my room I could never have a minimalistic room bc I’m to messy and can’t let go of things.

Personally I also don’t like blood like at all I cringe at the word and I’m mildly hemophobic which is a little ironic since I sh but I like emptying myself of the blood I feel much cleaner which is a problem of itself bc I’m anemic for other reasons but that’s not the point.
Everyone has different reasons but if you sum it up it’s because we want it to hurt, or we want to feel something usually if you dissociate, or shift the emotional pain to physical to get a release."	_ibt	reply	na	na	na	0.0011799022322520614	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
Cuz it feels good, cause sometimes it's grounding when I'm out of my mind (anxiety or panic), because sometimes my depression thinks it's necessary, because I like seeing myself bleed (it's my favorite color and it's mesmerizing to see it come out me) and because I deserve to be in pain and suffer	_ibt	reply	na	na	na	0.0011799022322520614	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
it is painful during and after, but that is the important part. your body has a hierarchy of priorities. emotional pain is pretty high up there and your body will keep trying to tackle it and hyper-fixate on it even though it can’t be fixed. one of the only things higher up on the list of priorities is physical pain. when i self harm my brain and body zero in on that pain and all my emotions fade into the background. also seeing the blood and then doing my cleanup routine is really therapeutic. when i’m in really depressed kicks, that cleanup is often the first bit of self care or even hygiene i’ve attended to in days. also, having the scars under my sleeves and knowing i put them there makes me feel so in control and like all my problems are real and my emotions are valid. when they heal, i like to view it as my brain healing.	_ibt	reply	na	na	na	0.0011799022322520614	weak	no	no	na	selfharm

Personally, I never remember the pain. Logically I’m pretty sure that when I do it I feel pain, but it’s never the part that sticks with me. When I think back to my most intense “sessions” I remember the cuts as feeling comforting. Sometimes I have felt genuinely euphoric after a session. Whether those sessions were especially painful or not is not something my brain bothers to record. I mainly do it to get rid of bad emotions. Sometimes I do it because I’m just bored. I’m ambivalent about stopping so I made a promise to only do it when it’s “necessary”, but I know myself. Eventually I will probably be back to doing it every day. That’s the main reason people sh.

"I cant speak for everyone when it comes to pain, but from what ik, some people either don't care about the pain, do it for the pain, or are desensitized to it, but im sure there's more to it.

And for the actual reason people do it, there's a lot, here's the most i can think of.

Regulating emotions (resorting to it when you're having overwhelming emotions)

temporary relief from pain (emotional, or other pain unrelated to s/h)

coping with trauma

gives the person a sense of control

punishing themself because they feel as if they deserve it

emotionally numb, using s/h to feel something

distraction from things going on in the persons life, thoughts, feelings, etc

intrusive thoughts

impulsivity 

gives the person an adrenaline rush (sometimes related to being emotionally numb)

externalizing any internalized pain

dissociation

to alleviate guilt (similar to punishing themself)

a cry for help (some people dont do it necessarily because they want to, but because they use it for a cry for help, or to communicate emotions through physical harm)"	_ibt	reply	na	na	na	0.0011799022322520614	no	no	no	na	selfharm
"the pain part is actually a difficult thing to answer and I hope I can help you understand a bit more. the thing is that there are a lot of factors at play. depression, past trauma, and derealization/depersonalization for example can disconnect one from physical pain. adrenaline will most likely build in anticipation for someone harming themselves and can diminish the pain. not to mention some people will do drugs or drink before or in the midst of harming themselves. 

when someone does get hurt (whether by their own hand or not), adrenaline and other hormones are released that can dull the pain. have you ever heard stories of people getting seriously hurt and all they felt was heat, pressure, or nothing at all? that’s because of the adrenaline and hormones your body pumps out in the hopes that you can get out of the situation that caused the harm. 

so, some people feel everything when harming themselves, some have it dulled, and some barely feel a thing. it’s honestly kind of interesting to look into, imo."	_ibt	reply	na	na	na	0.0011799022322520614	weak	no	no	na	selfharm

Tbh, I sh when I’m going through it, and I’ve been going through it basically my whole life, but if the crisis I’m going through is rough then I won’t feel the first few cuts, then I tend to dissociate while cutting and then cutting deeper helps me realize I’m actually hurting myself and then I stop to cry. It is painful sometimes, I’ve actually cut so deep that I had to stitch myself up after I passed out, I also had one on my leg where I could see the fat for a few days after while it was healing, that one gives me more flashbacks then the one where I passed out does.	_ibt	reply	na	na	na	0.0011799022322520614	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
that’s kinda the point. or at least for me ig. my home environment is full of emotional and verbal abuse so i was never able to properly manage my emotions. sometimes i would self harm when i got upset or angry so i would lash out and say something that would cause more yelling from my parents. other times it would be because i felt numb and needed to feel alive. either way the pain was able to ground me and bring me to a reality. it let me turn my emotional pain physical. if i could go back to before the addiction i would probably tell myself to find a different way to manage thing but at this point i’m in to deep. i hope anyone who reads this knows sh isn’t the only way and that it causes more problems than it solves.	_ibt	reply	na	na	na	0.0011799022322520614	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

"Yeah, but honestly it's kinda the point. It feels better to feel voluntary physical pain than unvoluntary emotional pain. It helps focus the brain on another pain, and there's a certain weird satisfaction after it, like a relief. For me it's like that, I am highly sensitive physically and emotionally so it's hard for me to cut a lot, and if I do it's only one cut ""per session"". But because or my depression, pain and all the negative feelings related to it is the only thing I can feel. I know it sounds edgy but it's a fact, I'm working on it in therapy to relearn to feel positive emotions again.

"I’m gonna take two approaches to this: my personal experience and what’s been scientifically proven which shows the effect more clinically

I started over 7 and a half years ago. I felt just…really empty. I had for a while, and at the time I had no word for it. I just wanted to feel *something*. Since then, it’s become one of my only and most reliable crutches to fall back on when I feel like shit. If I feel nothing again, it makes me feel better. If I feel too stressed out, it helps me feel calmer. Yes it hurts, but at least it’s only physical. Besides, even when I go deep, it doesn’t really hurt until later, and in the moment I feel happy for a little while. And, in a weird way, it’s kind of validating. I’ve been through a lot of shit and have some traumas to heal from, but people in my life tend to dismiss my experiences or at least downplay it. At least the scars and pain is there to prove that it’s not all in my head and there actually is something wrong

Now for the more clinical approach. When the body is harmed, it releases endorphins. Basically endorphins are “happy chemicals”, [this article by the Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23040-endorphins#:~:text=Endorphins%20are%20released%20when%20your,that%20receive%20the%20pain%20signals) explains it pretty well. It’s basically the body’s way of helping you not freak out if you’ve been hurt. Like when you hear about people walking away from a major accident, the energy comes from adrenaline but the lack of pain comes from endorphins. That’s why self harm usually doesn’t hurt as much when you’re actively doing it and then the pain sets in later, the endorphins block the nerves telling the brain it’s hurt

We have less of these “happy chemicals” than other people so we have to seek out ways to get them ourselves. Our baseline is much lower than other people’s and we have to work to get back up to normal, so even though we know it isn’t healthy, it’s something we *know* can make us feel better 

The article even mentions that endorphins work better than morphine, it’s literally an addiction and it gets you high. The fact that it’s an addiction and the fact that (in my case at least) a lot of times people will tell you to stop without giving alternatives, means that we’re left feeling incredibly shitty without it and it makes it very hard to stop **even when we desperately want to.** Like, for example, in all the years I’ve been self harming, I’ve never even made it to 6 months clean, and being clean for long periods of time tends to make me freak out. Endorphins are naturally released by the body, everyone has them, but from what I understand it’s the pattern of how they’re released in us that separates us from other people"	_ibt	reply	na	na	na	0.0011799022322520614	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
"(not saying this is a rude tone, I swear), but that's the point. It's to feel hurt, the pain is a self punishment for a lot of us, and it usually gives us an outlet, or a release. Yknow how if you have a stomach ache, for hours and hours, that once the pain stops, you get that good feeling? Like you feel so nice, it's wonderful. It's like that, but more. Much more, normally normally. If I feel terrible the entire damn day, or week, or hell, even month, I need the pain to make it through however long the ""bad mood"" lasts. I know many others have already answered you, but honestly I just want to talk to a real person for once."	_ibt	reply	na	na	na	0.0011799022322520614	weak	strong	no	na	selfharm
for me it helps me regulate my emotions and calm down. it's kinda like a factory reset if you will. the pain helps clear my mind and let me think more rationally. it also helps me when I'm really understimulated because when I'm understimulated I tend to get panic attacks due to textures not feeling right, i.e they don't feel strong enough or feel like they are too thin and it just helps me come back to reality.	_ibt	reply	na	na	na	0.0011799022322520614	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

as maybe an alternative perspective, its not super about the pain for me, its like i get all tweaky and anxious until it either passes or i self harm, and there's something about the act of self harming, and even the actual after care process (i.e. cleaning up, dressing it) that makes the anxiety go away.	_ibt	reply	na	na	na	0.0011799022322520614	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
I self harm because the verbal abuse and emotional stress from my parents is harder for me to cope with than the physical pain I get from cutting myself, as that also feels like a release of SOME stress I have, of course not all, but it feels like I’m dealing with the issue, well like, actually doing something about it, instead of pushing it down internally and leaving it to feel like an aching mess inside me emotionally. So the physical pain hurts so much less than the emotional pain I feel.	_ibt	reply	na	na	na	0.0011799022322520614	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
"Whenever I have a very intense emotion- even positive ones- I find it really hard to regulate myself once more. So generally I have to let it out some way, and most of the ways I’ve found are sadly self destructive. Basically anything that hurts helps, but *sometimes* running or jumping will help (but sometimes they make it worse (for me)). 
But especially when I’m depressed sh is a much easier thing for me to do then to go outside and run for a while yknow?
It’s not healthy and I don’t condone it and I do my best not to, but sometimes people do things that aren’t healthy. It’s just in our nature. It’s just that some unhealthy things (such as drinking, or smoking) are more socially acceptable then things like self harm."	_ibt	reply	na	na	na	0.0011799022322520614	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

"as many others have said, its mostly for distraction and also due to self hate (in my experience). 

For example, a few days ago i did it and kind of unintentionally went deeper than usual. Since then, ive had to care for the wound and its still not healed. Probably will take a while and the whole process (of shing and then taking care of it) was really just a major distraction bc in the days that ive had this injury, most of the time i will be thinking abt how i need to change the dressing or how it hurts when i move my arm etc etc so my brain, in a way, doesnt get time to focus on negative feelings. 

And after some of the deeper-than-usual sh injuries that bleed more, its especially numbing (in a good way for me) because i literally feel like i came out of a trance and can function like a sane human being. Sometimes it even feels like the me that shed was just someone else and i cant fully relate to wtv i was feeling at the time that made me do it. Maybe its my way of disassociating myself from the fact that i just hurt myself on purpose. 

Not sure if its making any sense but all in all its a form of release of pent up frustration and just any intense emotions."	_ibt	reply	na	na	na	0.0011799022322520614	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

I'm over a year clean atm but when I was still selfharming, it was to control my emotions. I used to get a lot of panic attacks, always over the smallest things. At my worst it was like 2-3 a day and that lasted for 4-6 months. I didnt know how to stop them without hurting myself. Ofcourse i had people who wanted to help me but i just felt embarrassed bc the panic attacks were based on the tiniest inconvenience. I had 4 panic attacks within a month all because I was out of bread. So I stopped asking for help and just started selfharming because it was like a wave of calmness came over me. The feeling is pretty similar to smoking and altho I quit SH, i kinda switched addictions to nicotine, but I'm trying to quit that too.	_ibt	reply	na	na	na	0.0011799022322520614	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
"before i started SHing, I knew vaguely about the concept of SH, and I wondered the same question - doesn't it hurt? why would people endure something that hurts so much?

and now that I unfortunately SH, the answer is yeah, it hurts like a mfer. but some people do it for the pain, maybe because it's the only thing they can feel, or because it feels cathartic almost. personally I SH so that I can see my mental pain, physically, in the form of scars, if that makes sense. It lets me know that my mental pain is real and not fake, I guess. 

also, SH is like a drug, people will do it regardless of the bad side effects because it provides short term relief.

-you're addicted to it (as anything that causes you to feel better can be addictive mentally)

I find that I am mostly desensitised to the pain. Pain when you’re in control of it is not the same as pain when it’s inflicted on you, if somebody took a blade to my skin and recreated some of the cuts I have done on myself I am sure the pain would be agonising, but I hardly feel the pain when I am cutting myself. Processing pain isn’t always logical like that and often depends on mindset, if you’re in control of pain it usually feels more manageable - think of all the people who get tattoos despite the fact they are painful. Just because so,etching is painful doesn’t mean it’s unbearable and you do get used to. Plus usually when I am self harming I am in an emotionally heightened and sometimes slightly disassociated state so I am not really focusing on the pain or processing what’s happened as much as I might when calm and regulated. Also once you’ve made that first cut generally the adrenaline and endorphins do enough so that any pain is not really noticeable, often it’s hours or even days afterwards that the injury will really start to hurt rather than when you actually have done it.	_ibt	reply	na	na	na	0.0011799022322520614	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

People do it for a whole load of different reasons. To gain control in there life when they feel they don’t have any control. Some people enjoy the pain as their emotions are numb/empty so they hurt themselves to feel something. People like seeing the blood, they like seeing the damage their doing to theirselves. Those are just some of the reasons. It’s a very real addiction as it’s so addictive, when you self harm it releases  Endorphins so you feel this sense of euphoria. This feeling doesn’t last long so that’s why people keep doing it because they’re essentially chasing the “high” like many people are when they are addicted to drugs. You get like psychological withdrawals is the best way I can explain it. Like if you don’t self harm for awhile you get really intense urges to do it so it’s a very dangerous and challenging addiction to break from. For me at least it’s been happening for almost 5 years on and off, it’s like once you start you never really escape. You can not do it for so long but there is always an urge and a desire to do it. That’s my experience anyways it’s different for everyone. Hope this helps you understand better.

I've been clean now for quite a while, but the reason I did it was because it was painful. I was very emotionally numb and felt quite empty, so feeling pain was better than feeling nothing.

"For me it's always been when I've had a surge of OVERWHELMING emotion. I can't emphasis enough the sense of being overwhelmed by it. It's a release and it happens so reflexively in response to how I feel, it's not something I've decided to do. 

The more minor self harm is when I can feel I'm going to be overwhelmed so I'll prick my fingers or dig my nails/something pointy into my fingertips, scratch along somewhere, slap etc. It's a distraction from an emotional pain to a physical discomfort.

"I have various reasons why I do it. I'll just make a lil list cuz idk how else to put it lol
-to feel pain. Not cuz I think I deserve it but cuz I like self inflicted pain
- blood. I love the sight of the dark red bleeding wounds, tho mine don't bleed that much so I try to cut deeper every time I do it.
- having cool scars and feeling them. I love scars and I want as many as I can get cuz the way they look on my skin is just so interesting and it feels nice to run my fingers over my skin with those lil bumpy lines.
- cuz I have mentally abusive parents who yell at eachother and talk to and treat me and my siblings horribly. I'm also the oldest and try to protect my siblings as much as I can but the hopeless feeling I get when they cry or when my sister gets mad at me for trying to help her or when my parents yell so much at me till I leave so they can continue yelling at my siblings, it makes me hate that I can't do more so I sh.

For the pain, it depends. I’ve found in my experience that the act of doing it doesn’t hurt because i just feel numb, but it burns after like a paper cut. I do it to feel, to almost like validate my life experience and the a**se i go through, and to find a way to let out the emotional dysregulation that comes with untreated adhd.

I’m a little over 2 months sober but recently I realised no one cares at all. like when I tell someone it goes in one ear and out the other. And everyone brings up my triggers like food and my sexuality but they don’t care and I don’t know why. Last year my bother went through a battle with self harm and my mom and dad didn’t let him around a knife of a sharp object of any kind but I get to the point where the cuts bleed so much it bleeds through my clothes but they the me have razer blades and pencil sharpeners in my room but I don’t know that to do because I will relapse and go through this all over again.	me_but_not_you	post	1.2109039121538636	male	White	0.9980624318122864	na	na	na	2	selfharm

You are valid and I’m so sorry that anyone has ever made you believe otherwise. It’s so upsetting that people who are supposed to be our friends and love and support us bring up our triggers. Trust me I know and it sucks. There are so many other ways to cope without sh and I understand wanting tk relapse but it’s not worth it. When you were sh ing were you happy?
Did it fix anything? Did it make the problem go away? No. It made nothing better. When I feel like relapsing I remind myself of why I can’t do that. The super bad parts abt sh. The stinging showers, blood stains, the pain, loss of trust from people, the constant hiding and lying it’s not worth it Ml and I’m here for u if u need to talk ❤️"	me_but_not_you	reply	na	na	na	0.9980624318122864	strong	no	no	na	selfharm
I’m gonna be real with you and share a little about my experiences in the last few years, which I haven’t fully done on here yet. I was a severe alcoholic for many years. And I battled with very bad sh during my addiction as well. In fact, I struggled with sh for over a decade. This month makes 5 months clean and 1 year sober for me. So I’d like to say I understand and know how you’re feeling. For almost 2 full years I showed up to my job, in front of family, in front of friends… everywhere. Visibly withering away right in front of them. The sad reality is, no one actually cared. If they did, they never showed it. They asked others if I was okay, never asked me directly. They gossiped, ignored, just.. watched. It’s a cruel world out there honestly. You don’t find many with good or big hearts anymore. People who care. BUT, I can say this. I care. I care so much. I’m so extremely proud of you for being 2 months sober. And I believe in you. If I can, you can! You just keep going and keep pushing forward. And know that if you do make a mistake or make some bad decisions along the way. It’s okay. Because you’re human. The important thing to remember is, it’s not about how many time we fall or get knocked down. It’s about how many times we get back up and keep going.

"Right it does depend on how deep they are but i use concealer for my thigh and arm ones.

Wear knee covers. You can get skin toned ones, but they're deceptively easy to notice, so I'd recommend just getting some in your favorite colour and saying you just like how they look. Your knees are gonna be hot as hell, and probably feel very swampy, but it's better than people noticing right? Also, please wash the covers and put bandages on the cuts/scratches before you put the covers on, because if they start bleeding, they WILL bleed through the thin things. Also, wash the cuts/scratches properly. You don't want an Infection, even if they're scratches and not cuts, (I have a terrible memory and ive already been writing for a second and I don't remember if you specified which. ) because even scratches can get infections. •◡•	One_Quit1969	reply	na	na	na	0.9991863369941711	no	no	no	na	selfharm
Also I'm talking about the, uh, the little ones, I think? The ones that ONLY cover your knee, And a little bit above and below. Speaking of which, I would recommend getting elbow covers as well, to match, so it seems more natural. Or gloves, though I wouldn't recommend wearing said gloves outside. You're hands will feel *𝘚𝘖* sweaty. Plus if your some where like texas or Phoenix, the gloves are gonna seem even more out of place.

"I (18f) just cut myself for the first time in almost 2 years. But it was different. When I used to cut myself it was a form of punishment. I hated my life in every sense from 2019-2021 and I would use it as a way to ""release"" guilt and other feelings. But it never worked. I just became increasingly violent towards myself over more and more trivial things and it was actually getting dangerous. 

I'm not as mentally ill as I used to be by any means, my feelings and sh used to be so bad it was starting to interfere with my day to day life. But I cut myself again today. However I wasn't in a state of emotional distress when I did it, unlike in the past.

I *won't* say what I used but I was using a certain beauty product and I accidentally cut myself in one spot and then I started slashing aimlessly just to make myself bleed. It's weird...I think in a non-sexual sense I'm some kind of masochist, I just like how it felt and I liked watching myself bleed. It doesn't turn me on or anything though, I think it's morbid fascination. 

I've always had habits like this. I used to pick my face until I was covered in scabs, pull on my lips until they bled, and bite my nails until they're freakishly short. Not gonna lie I still struggle with my nails but thankfully the other habits have passed me by (for the most part). I'm wondering if since I ditched my other 2 shitty coping mechanisms, if this is my brains way of making up for it since I'm dealing with a ton of stress right now."

i feel you so much OP. i’ve had my mom say some of the cruelest things about my self harm, including exactly what you quoted. honestly, we can’t control what other people say or do, the best thing we can do is be responsible for what’s in our control. remove yourself from the situation if possible, talk to a therapist if you have the ability to, and surround yourself with loving friends and people that support you. once you’re old enough to move out, do it. Trust me, it helped a lot. doesn’t mean you have to cut her out of your life, but maybe things will get easier as you spend time apart. i wish you so much luck and good energy. her words are coming from a place of anger and frustration so don’t take them to heart. stay safe, much love ❤︎	decayingtonight	reply	na	na	na	0.999298095703125	weak	strong	no	na	selfharm

I know it, but

I'm not sure, you see

I want to satisfy this unpleasant feeling

I don't really understand the meaning

But I want to destroy myself and lie on the ground

Covered in blood looking with satisfaction at my wounds

I want something sharp below my chest

I would die if it was real

All I want is to feel

It's just a dream, and it's for the best


-


I want to feel complete 

I'm a blank canvas that wants to be red

I paint myself again and again, I want something concrete

It's never enough, I always end up laying in my bed

No need to make a distress call

They're just thoughts after all

"When I was a teenager I used to SH very frequently. Nothing ever extreme or deep though. In my adulthood though this has changed. I now very rarely SH via cutting, but the 2-3 times a year I do it’s usually one or two very large and intense deep cuts that need stitches. This has made it a lot more difficult to lie about the fact that I’ve SH to others because there’s no denying what a giant scar across my forearm is from. So instead of asking what happened, people now ask “why?”. 

I’m stuck when I hear this question though. It was an easy answer as a teen, I was depressed and suicidal and living in an abusive home. Now though things are good. I have an incredible job, I’m in college, have my own apartment with pets I adore, I’m medicated and in therapy, yet sometimes a switch just flips in my head and I inevitably relapse. And I know there’s no benefit to cutting so I never know how to respond. 

Logically I know SH isn’t a good route to go. Despite this I always return to it and I can’t explain why. What would you say? Especially to hospital staff when in need of stitches, or to my parents who just don’t understand. I feel bad my answer always comes down to “I don’t know, I just had to do it”"	eatfurbys	post	22.924206151781455	male	White	0.9865482449531555	na	na	na	4	selfharm
it’s silly because the tiniest thing will make us sad but our brain will go straight the SH because it’s made us feel happy before. it’s one of those things that you can never really stop even if you are SH free because it will always be an option in the back of your mind. usually i’d just say some tame answer like: “i was just in my head last night, i’m ok now” i’m sorry if this was too long and rambling	eatfurbys	reply	na	na	na	0.9865482449531555	no	no	no	na	selfharm

"If you feel comfortable with it, you could explain it as something like: ""I was in a really difficult place as a teenager, and even though my life has since gotten better this is just how my brain has learned to cope.""

"Hello Reddit,

There's a constant anxiaty feeling I have in the background and it's like I can't function without harming myself in some way.Exactly like a drug or smoking.I've had this happening to me since I was about 15.

Not even if you take anything sharp from I won't be stopping to find a way to make myself feel miserable.Like walking in circles until I feel as if vomiting.

How do I substitute this?
I would take everything as advice because I'm going through a rough period at the moment."	Steven_C64_53281_7	post	4.953517633384898	female	White	0.997666597366333	na	na	na	1	selfharm

"I own like a vent acc basically to spread awareness and to give content people can relate too so they don’t feel alone in their situation I post well more than just sh videos . I always add tw too my videos if it may be too much for some. But most people love my content. I posted this video yesterday abt cutting it got over 1000 likes lots of comments and shares. And i wake up to see that ppl in the comments we’re sending hate comments. One said that i was attention seeking, which was never my intention or thought. Because obviously i dont just cut for attention i cut to feel and to cope. And i replied to this person saying 
“ Like what ?? this is genuinely what i go through everyday if u can’t relate move tf on” even though there were other comments im focused more on this because it’s already things going around about cutter’s saying they cut just for attention. Some do but most don’t. Never ever would i fit into that category. But now im starting to think that

"""Psych ward"" is a more antiquated term for psychiatric inpatient. Psychiatric inpatient is typically in a hospital. I'm not sure what it's like where you're from, but in Canada, if you go to the ER they'll likely admit as an involuntary patient  if they are of the opinion  you have a condition that, if you were to leave the hospital, would cause serious mental or physical deterioration of you, serious physical impairment of you, and / or would result in serious bodily harm to yourself or others. You also have to have threatened or attempted to cause bodily harm to yourself, behaved violently towards another person (or have caused them to believe you will), or not caring for yourself. 

If none of this applies, you can be a voluntary patient, and with parents' permission, leave the hospital. If you are involuntary, you cannot leave the hospital. 

Psychiatric inpatient is typically for crisis stabilization, not treatment. There are other inpatient programs that are longer-term that do focus on treatment, though they are typically expensive.

First off I wanna say I’m sorry you’re going through a hard time. I, myself, battled with alcohol for 2-3 years and self harm for over a decade. I can wholeheartedly tell you and say, it’s not worth it. There is so much more to life. Despite the weight of the world, the hard times, the moments that feel impossible… it will never be worth it. I recommend, since you realize early on that it could be a problem in the future, to seek some help. Talk to someone you trust or find someone who’s faced/ gone through a similar battle and confide in them. I’m 5 months clean & 1 year sober. I lost many years of my life to both addictions. Please stay safe, friend. Know that there are people who care and are here for you whenever it is needed <3	Radiant-Poem4850	reply	na	na	na	0.0024594105780124664	strong	strong	no	na	selfharm
Would you consider smoking tabacco a form of sh..? Ive been considering it as an alternative to cutting due to the negative health effects and destressing factor, but i was wondering if anyone else thought of it as a sh thing or if its just a me thing.

"I think if you intend to harm your body with it, it's SH. 
Also I find it crazy that harming yourself with substances is more acceptable than cat scratches, when it destroys your body so much more.

I don't consider it SH, I don't smoke to hurt my body. Since it takes a while to notice any health effects, there's no thrill for me. It's a horrible harm reduction method though. Smoking is so expensive and so hard to quit and after a while it stops being fun, it's just something you have to do to feel somewhat normal. It's not really gonna help you with stress, you'll just experience a new kind of stress whenever you need to smoke and can't, and of course then that stress goes away when you have a smoke.

I started smoking for this exact reason, as a different coping mechanism to stop cutting. Four years later, I wish I had found a healthier way to cope.

If if was just one arm, you could bandage it and play it off as an accidental injury. It would probably look weird if you wrapped both your arms like that.

"I have a problem and I don’t know what happened.

So for context 4-5 moths ago I was on my lowest I’ve ever been. I’m talking relapsed after one year, ran away from home, didn’t care about anyone anymore, suicide attempts and more. Like I was down down. 

Anyways in the time where I wasn’t feeling great I lost the connection to anything really like I didn’t care about anything anymore. So If someone said that I should do something I just did it because I wasn’t really living anymore. Anyways there have been some people who used the opportunity of me being me and asked to for lets say lewd stuff. And because I didn’t care about anything anymore I accepted EVERYTHING they wanted. I’m feeling like the most horrible and worst person ever like I know I didn’t want to do any of that but it’s like in that time my brain left. Like I wasn’t really feeling anything anymore and I didn’t think about anything so I just went for it because I thought I’m useless anyway.

"i am currently in the car waiting for my mum to come back and i suddenly started feeling extremely overstimulated which triggered my anxiety BIG TIME.

i was wearing two beaded necklaces/chokers that i made myself, along with beaded bracelets that i also made. i practically panicked in trying to take them all off without breaking them and as soon as they were removed i felt the need to scratch the area that they’d been touching. i’ve NEVER scratched before, my main “source” of self-harm has always been cutting with a sharp object. i didn’t bleed but i kept scratching until each area was visibly irritated and i don’t know why i did.

is this self harm or was it just an extreme reaction to overstimulation/anxiety??"	ApprehensiveProfit19	post	19.342636495613778	female	White	0.9952098727226257	na	na	na	3	selfharm
If you don't know why you did it, i would say that it isn't self harm, since you didn't *intentionally* inflict any pain on yourself & I think that it was just a response to overstimulation, and you were just trying to cope with it.

Hello, I am a 13 year old. I started self harm when I was 11, and it  hasn’t been getting better. When I was 13, I stopped for a month or two, but then fell right back in. I feel pathetic. I feel like I’m a burden in this world. It hurts me to see myself in the mirror. Why can’t I have good looks like my face? My body isn’t fat, but I look ugly. Why? Why was I born the way I was? I hate myself. I hate my dad. My dad makes me feel worse about myself. He has never said any sort of compliment to me ever. I help him with his work significantly, and he doesn’t even say thank you. Why was I born in this family? I feel like dying. I’m unable to sleep, I can’t go to bed without having some sort of lucid dream, I get 3 hours of sleep at most. I feel like shit. I don’t have any close friends to talk to about it since i wasn’t too social until I was 13, but I don’t trust my friends and instead am saying it on this app. Nobody knows who I am, which is probably why. I just don’t feel good anymore. I feel so empty. Whatever I’m going through probably isn’t as bad as anyone else, and I don’t know why I’m even typing this anyway.

Don’t Ever put yourself down. Someone’s troubles is someone’s troubles. I know exactly what you mean, I understand wholeheartedly as I went through the same thing. It’s gonna take some confidence but, try warming up to your freinds a bit more, gain trust in at least one. It’s almost a human necessity to have someone to rely on. And with your dad? It will never get better unless you let him know how you feel. Don’t be worried about embarrassing yourself or feeling like they’re gonna push you aside. And about your looks? It’s really a matter of “don’t let your looks control you” and “be confident no matter who puts you down” it’s corny and I’ve bet you heard them before but it’s good life advice. And you’re still young too, I’m 15 and I went through the exact same thing when I was 13. Everything will be ok. You’re in the early stages of puberty where everything is gonna seem like bullshit. You will get over that hill. Keep your chin up, and your eyes straight and only focus on what’s ahead. Don’t let anything ever change your mind, Ever. I may not be the most qualified for life advice but please consider what I said here. It may save you one day.	CollapsingVortex	reply	na	na	na	0.9990575909614563	weak	strong	no	na	selfharm
"Straigthen up little soldier, you're going through something that is pretty normal at your age. We all went through it more or less. This is what will define you in the future. For my whole life I was not very social and scared to open up to people which made me end up more recluded on myself and distrusting others. You're definitely still young and things can change rapidly at your age because you need to get used to emotional changes that you will experience over time.
I see it that way, you already made a huge step by opening up on here and sharing your feelings with us. It's the first step towards healing.
Don't forget that you are strong, you are helping out your dad and even though he doesn't say it out loud I am conviced that he appreciates it deeply (he just has difficulties to express his appreciation).

I have been 51/50’d twice. Once was for cut wounds that aren’t nearly as bad as I have now and I even adamantly kept telling them then that I wasn’t suicidal and I didn’t even need stitches for my cuts at that time or anything but still got put in a mental hospital that time which traumatized me and I’m terrified of ever going back, I was sexually harassed in there and feared for my safety and couldn’t sleep for days. I self harm to make myself feel better sometimes. I went to cut my leg yesterday and it went wayyy deeper than I intended. The cut is about 5 inches long and it was gaping over an inch wide and I could see deep into my leg. I think I cut a nerve because I used butterfly clasps and bandages and infection cream on it and then today when I went to change everything, all of the skin around the wound is completely numb. When I touched the skin I couldn’t even feel on my leg that it was being touched, all the feeling is gone around the wound. And when I walk I have a little limp and have random muscle spasms and twitches and struggle with the stairs a lot. I just am struggling with treating a wound like this at home and would like advice or I would like advice on how to get treatment in an urgent care or ER without getting admitted and I’m just very easy for them to admit now.	juniperbj	post	27.90599588298703	female	White	0.9979832172393799	na	na	na	1	selfharm
"Are you a minor? If you are an adult, they don't generally give care about non-suicidal self harm.

Going to the hospital for treatment is probably a good idea. But this long after the injury, it'll most likely be impossible to stitch the wound. 

In future, unless advised by a doctor, do not put any creams in a wound. They can actually make it much worse."	juniperbj	reply	na	na	na	0.9979832172393799	no	no	strong	na	selfharm
"just wanted to share this with someone since i wrote it a couple years ago and haven’t had the chance to share it with anyone (not that i could if i wanted to lol) 



I whisper my name like a prayer on my lips, my reflection judging me from every corner of every room I have passed through since I was 4. (I have 43 mirrors in my house.) My dull curlless hair lays flat on my head, refusing to give me any reminder of who I am. The girl in the mirror tilts her head to the side and frowns. She’s ugly, in every sense of the word. I would hate to be her. 
Let me start again. 
I am Heaven, I am told. I am an atheist, I tell myself. I am Hell, I know from experience. My thighs tell a story of loneliness and despair and my mouth speaks half-lies and a bubbling laughter that still sounds too harsh. It grates against my skin, scraping it away like sandpaper, getting smoother and smoother the more blood washes over my wounds. I whisper my name like a prayer on my lips, my reflection judging me from my desk mirror. (I have five mirrors in my room.) My lips are covered in dried blackish blood and I can feel the congealed wounds as I run my tongue firmly against them. I smile wide, blood dripping down my chin, staining it and seeping into my pores. I’ll have to pry the dried blood from them later. I spread my lips wider, ignoring the deep, familiar sting as I feel the skin tear apart slowly, and this time the thick, bright red blood flows like a river, down beneath the curve of my chin. The first drop falls, mixing with the already cooling blood pooling below.
I whisper my name like a prayer on my lips. My reflection is nowhere to be found on my thighs as I watch the blood slowly fill the caverns I carved out of the meat of my flesh. The deep red is stark against my pale skin. I like that I can’t see myself in my blood. My eyes cannot be seen looking back at me as they trace the dark liquid running down the supple fat I hate so much. Blood is too thick to see a reflection in. It’s already full. Already brimming with memories and experiences and emotions. Already full. I’m 
“Already full?” 
My mother waits with expectant eyes. 
“Yeah, sorry.” 
“You got food at the dining hall?” 
“Yeah…Sorry.” 
The sludge sloshes in my stomach. I feel sick.
It feels good. 
***
I have been told that I don’t understand why it’s wrong when I do something to hurt myself. That’s not true. I do understand. I do. I just don’t care. And isn’t it so easy to not care? Doesn’t it just feel so good to finally give up? To let yourself be broken down, again and again until you are nothing more than what you were when you were created? Bruised, tattered skin and decaying organs, watering the rich soil with your blood until you really are nothing but dust. 
I guess it’s not so easy anymore, though. 
It’s hard to give up when my lips are on hers, making me forget about anything and everything else. When I look into her eyes and I can’t quite tell what she’s thinking but I so desperately want to. When she looks right back at me and I want to see what she sees so badly. I can feel the gnawing urge deep inside me, squirming through my intestines and pushing aside my organs, to look at a mirror and see what she sees and why she cares but it's so easy to forget when her hand is on the back of my neck and she fills up my vision so perfectly, breathless and shining and beautiful and looking at me like I am the only person in the world. It’s hard not to care about myself when she does. 
I still don’t know why she does.
I guess I should be clear with you; I used to cut myself. Not too sure why I started, but by the end, I didn’t want to stop. I don’t anymore. Now, when I look down at myself in the shower, shame sloshes in my stomach as my eyes trace the purple scars… But I don’t want to turn them red again. The water in the shower never runs pink anymore. But that doesn’t mean I don’t think back to those times and get so lost in my memories. When I step out of the shower and my feet hesitantly touch the cold, blue tiles, sometimes I stay there for an eternity, looking at the girl in the mirrors in front of me. 
How many mirrors does one bathroom need? (Seven). 
And when her body is a little too big and a little too slouched and a little too marred to be pretty, I wish I could revel in my self-hatred like I used to not too long ago. When I could so easily sit and cry and know I wasn’t enough and there wasn’t a single person to prove me wrong. Sometimes (all the time), the floor calls to me, whispers to me, claws at my ankles, and tells me how good it would feel to fall and let it envelop me for eternity. Sometimes, it's all I can do to not sink to my knees in surrender. (Are you even sober?)
But I can’t. (Are you sure?)
Because somewhere out there, in a too-small bed with soft fluffy covers, someone is on their phone, ignoring their homework, and maybe, just maybe, they might be thinking of me, all of me, and smiling.
And for now, that’s enough.

I have no idea why, but I like to coat my blade in harmful substances when I self harm, like hand sanitiser. Is this normal?	Defiant_Simple_4818	post	4.626056559240002	male	White	0.9969683289527893	na	na	na	4	selfharm
People do all kinds of stuff to hurt themselves further when they're self harming. Do you put other substances on your blade? Hand sanitizer shouldn't be dangerous, it will probably destroy some cells and make the healing process longer, but at least you won't get an infection from it. I think it still causes less tissue damage than pouring it directly into open wounds. Maybe you do it to increase the pain? I imagine it would sting a lot more and lead to some irritation.

Last year was my worst year because I got rejected by a girl I liked (who ironically made me start to value life again before I confessed my feelings to her).
That's when it went downhill, I lost someone who was like a third grandma for me, then I gave up on my studies, smoked weed on a daily basis, started cocaine, hung out with only bad influence, distanced myself from best friends and even family.

I can get very desperate, so desperate I turn to God. And since God is supposed to love us, He wouldn’t want me to cut right?? So, doing anything for my parents’ validation, I made a “deal” with Him, in which I didn’t cut until June so I would do exceptionally well in this very important exam. And it worked, my parents are still so proud of me for doing so well in that exam. At that point I was 4 months clean. I was doing pretty well, so next thing I knew 4 months turned into 5. Once I got there, I made it a goal to get to 6 months, because why not? End of July, my cat got very sick. I love that cat more than I love anything in my life. Again, I found myself so desperate, I made one of those “deals”. The moment I swore I wouldn’t cut myself until Christmas, he got better. I can’t go on not cutting, but I’m afraid he might get sick again. I’m so stupid, I don’t even believe in God. Still, I’m scared for him. And I just CAN’T. I’m alright during the day, but the moment I go to bed I start shaking and I can’t escape the thoughts of self harm. It also doesn’t help that I’ve recently gone off of antidepressants, because my psychiatrist is a moron and she doesn’t realize I’ve been lying to her for well over a year now. I’m so scared and lonely and stressed. School is starting soon and I don’t want it to be like last September, writing suicide notes in class and crying in the bathroom bcs it’s just too painful	fluffyduck_0	post	5.175634697887052	female	White	0.9975062012672424	na	na	na	5	selfharm
I know what it feels like to have a cat get sick. My girl was diagnosed with diabetes and I couldn’t handle it. I’m sorry ur going through all of that, but good thing he’s currently better! It’s good to have faith if that’s what makes you feel best, and no matter what happens now it doesn’t erase the 5/6 months you spent clean, and you should celebrate that. I recommend telling the truth to your therapist because they’re only there to help. I know you’ve probably heard it before, but meditation/ breathing exercises/ mindful yoga before bed will really help that anxiety. And if you can’t get through it, it’s completely fine, don’t beat yourself up. Be kind to yourself and remember you gotta take it one step at a time.

"take this as a sign if you will:

i *know* you can get through this. bad things will happen constantly, but no matter how hard itll be, there will always be someone rooting for you. there will be people who wont ever give up on you. you are *so* loved.

even if you do relapse, God will still love you. *no one,* and i mean *no one* can ever take that away from you. it feels like life is caving in on you, especially since school is starting, and i can relate to that big time. the hardest thing to ever do is come clean about something as heavy as this, but being honest with your psychiatrist (unless you feel unsafe) is really key to getting the help you need.

Coming clean to my therapist would only get me admitted to a mental hospital and cause stress for my parents, that why I’ve been lying to her in the first place (also I don’t think I’m actually capable of getting better, I’ve always been like this).

"Before I say anything: always make sure you don't cut too deep. If you really need to actually self harm, Try to not get irreversable scars, they are horrible.

That saying, I sh in my panty line, knee caps (so u can wear socks over it, but that only in cold weather where always wearing socks is alright), and near armpits but a little down, so a short sleeve would cover them.

"I honestly still self harm in places where I 
. 
Here is a harm reduction trick I learned that may not work for everyone but when I self harm I do it with a sharp tool, not too much pressure BUT VERY slowly (makes it so much more painful) and make THE TINIEST lines. It's ideal to me because cleaning up blood is so annoying especially after a bad breakdown but I still get a good sting if I do it slow enough and only with a little bit of pressure (it works best with thin and sharp tools). It literally does not show like AT ALL in a few days and if you don't shave your body hair and you do it where it's a bit more hairy then you won't see it at all. 

This is NOT at all to promote self harm but this is how I keep myself from big relapses. I still get the pain from cutting but do it as small as I can. 

This might not work for people who want to be satisfied with what they're seeing when they self harm though (blood, depth etc) ."	aolisayce	reply	na	na	na	0.9938596487045288	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

My thighs mostly. I am a guy who goes to the gym frequently with friends, so on leg days I am expected to wear shorts and on occasion I am expected to take off my shirt. This means i cant cut anywhere but my thighs, inckuding no calfs either. I also have siblings that share the same room as me so they would see me without a shirt on too. Because of this, I rarely ever sh somewhere other than my thighs as that would be too high risk. I alr got questions from them bc I had scars across my left bicep... I had to lie ab it.

So since I was very very small when mosquitoes bite me I scratch a lot, sometimes even reaching the meat, and when the crust appears I remove it every time. real craters. It became more and more of a nervous scratching. Then in addition to those of the mosquitoes I started doing it myself, every time I'm nervous I scratch at random points starting the cycle. All this in thtte parts of the body. Then I started cutting myself thinking I would stop scratching but it only got worse. Not to mention hot showers, pulling my hair out, and only feeling complete if something hurts me. It's always full of blood EVERYWHERE it's so annoying.

"I started at first where the panty is at the side of your hip(yk where I mean? English isn’t my first language sorry) and it worked really well because I could still wear a swimming suit and stuff but now I do it on my thighs too. 
I thought I hid it well until my mom said “I know that you don’t wanna swim with me because of those disgusting cuts on your thigh” now I know that she just didn’t care. It hurts and I wish I would’ve continued where I started. My thigh is full off irreversible scars and I won’t be going swimming for a while i guess so I don’t recommend it. Maybe don’t use a blade but use your finger nails(wash them before) it won’t go too deep and it won’t really leave scars."	aolisayce	reply	na	na	na	0.9938596487045288	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

started w inner arms when i was younger & just wore long sleeves all the time. worked well cause im cold all the time lol but i got nerve damage there that would jolt down my arm to my hands because there isn't enough fat & meat. did shoulder a bit but didn't like it. 3rd degree burned my outer forearm (couldn't do that shit on my inner arm or i wouldn't be able to move my hand. couldn't do leg either or i wouldn't have been able to walk the months it took to heal). my worst cuts i resorted to my thigh as well, there's the most fat/meat there, so it's harder to damage nerves but i have still.	aolisayce	reply	na	na	na	0.9938596487045288	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

"For you to understand this better, you could go to my profile to see my last post on selfharmscars. That was from my last relapse. 

Now my brother just got back from school, and is 2 years clean of self harm. This evening, while in the kitchen with our mum, I crossed my legs which made the scar visible.

He then touches the scars (which I didn’t find weird because he does that with the scars on my arms) and said that they’re triggering him and he wants to throw away his 2 years sobriety because he’s struggling right now. I kinda froze and didn’t know what to say.

We couldn’t talk well because mum was there but I told him that if he’s okay with it, we could talk more extensively tomorrow about what he’s been going through and find healthier coping mechanisms he could use. 

It immediately made me feel like I had to start covering up again to not trigger him and now I don’t even know how to handle this tomorrow. I’d really appreciate any advice.

TDLR: my junior brother said my leg scars are giving him self harm urges and he feels like throwing his 2 years sobriety away because he’s struggling right now. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you."	Enolamo	post	18.192964123403904	female	White	0.997605562210083	na	na	na	1	selfharm

You’re staring at the glowing red CVS sign in the rearview mirror of your car with your hand resting on the door handle and you’d like to believe that you’re going to drive away and forget this ever happened-- that you ever turned your blinker on and got in the left lane on your way home from school. That you waited an agonizing 10 seconds screaming at yourself ‘Switch back! It’s 9:30, no one is on the road!’ until the light turns green and you make the inevitable left turn. Are you going to open the car door and walk into the flood of fluorescent lights? You don’t know. You don’t know who you are or what you’re going to do, and that scares you. 

You’re still listening to your “Mango Days'' playlist that you turned on to try and persuade yourself to switch lanes. It worked, but you wish it hadn’t. So you’re sitting in your car, your hand numb from resting on the cold metal handle, about to run into the CVS to get it over with when “I Deserve to Bleed” by Sushi Soucy fades out and that telltale distorted electric guitar fills the small space of your Toyota Camry. “Bugbear” by Chloe Moriondo has begun playing. 

It’s not really the perfect song for this playlist, but it has a couple lyrics that are especially self destructive, so you let it slide. You push the door open and step out into the freezing winter air. Wrapping yourself up in your large purple coat, you remind yourself to get a better jacket. The one you’re wearing lets all the air through and on a night like tonight, you wish you had a different one. The white lights of the CVS make it look almost divine contrasted with the pitch black night threatening to swallow it whole. A kind of heaven open from 8 AM to 10 PM every day of the week. 
As you walk in, you greet the regular staff members and you wonder if they’re suspicious of you; if they know what you’re there for. You wonder if they can hear your thoughts, so loud in your head, clashing against the lyrics of “Bugbear” playing in your mind like a radio that won’t shut up, no matter how much you beg for silence. 
Your eyes are glazed as you wander the aisles. You have to pick something to buy before you can go to the third aisle from the back on the right. (It would be too suspicious otherwise.) So you begin the trek to the snack section. You can’t bring yourself to eat meals these days, so you like to wander snack aisles to see if you can feel hungry again. You hum to yourself the parts of the “Bugbear'' that made you put it on your playlist: sleepin' through your days and skippin' meals / must sound so unappealing / but I guess it's different when it's the norm. Breakfast bars worked until they didn’t. Yogurt worked until you couldn’t stomach dairy anymore. Doritos seem like the best option, so you grab a family sized bag. In the middle of the empty store, the only sounds are the soft hum of the lights and your breathing. When you walk, you can even hear your socks move against the soles of your sneakers. Only now, the crinkling of the Doritos bag in your hand cuts through the quiet like a chainsaw in the middle of the woods and you immediately wish you had picked something else. 

With solemn resignation, you head to the third aisle from the back on the right, clutching your bag of Doritos. The aisle is about 15 feet away. When you get there, you walk 3 feet into the aisle, turn right, pick it up and put it in your pocket, and keep going. 

On your way to the register, you stop in the makeup section, your hands shaking as your hold it in your palm. “Bugbear” is playing in your head again. ‘Sinking deeper into whatever this is without a hint of reflection- / can't tell if this is the calm or if this is the storm.’ You’ve let yourself get this far. Do you really want this? Can you hide it again? Are you prepared to slip off the edge? 
Are you gonna get a running start? 
***
The Doritos and a 10 pack of double edge razor blades sit lonely in the middle of the makeup section on your way out."	tulips_and_hellos	post	27.029702834934167	female	White	0.009493834339082241	na	na	na	2	selfharm

I’ve been self harming for about 6 years and when having intimate relationships with people I haven’t hurt myself so they wouldn’t ask questions. I recently entered a fwb situation and I don’t think he’s noticed any of my self harm scars and if he has he hasn’t mentioned anything a lot of my scars r discreet as I don’t want family or friends to notice them. I’m not an avid harmer like I was in my earlier days and go long periods of time without doing it but tonight I relapsed. I’m not proud of it and I’ve gone further with it than I wanted to meaning that a lot of it is in extremely obvious places which he will see. I’m really frustrated with myself that I’ve done this but I’m just wondering what I should say to him if he asks about the cuts? I don’t want to openly discuss it with him as it’s something I keep to myself and even posting on here seems quite far but it’s giving me anxiety and can’t ask friends as I don’t want them to worry about me. Any tips on what I can say to him if he asks about them?	Character_Thought_21	post	24.26328364255577	female	White	0.9975649118423462	na	na	na	2	selfharm
Maybe tell them that a cat really messed you up? I'm sorry if this is horrible advice. I don't really know what else to say, but later, if you're ready to tell them, then you should just say if. Again, I'm sorry if this is horrible advice, and if you don't want to tell them ever, that's fine too.	Character_Thought_21	reply	na	na	na	0.9975649118423462	strong	no	no	na	selfharm
I used to use this excuse because my neighbours had a cat, but I now live in an apartment where I wouldn’t be coming into contact with any😭 I’m not sure if to just pre warn him or just see if he doesn’t say anything? I just really don’t want to go down the deep convo route as I’m not good at talking about my feelings and at the end of the day he’s only a fwb not a boyfriend but I care about him enough that I don’t want him to have to deal with it. I’ve woken up rly angry at myself now I can see how bad it is but I suppose addiction is addiction I’m trying not to beat myself up too badly for it. I feel like a conversation is going to have to be had tho :( thankyou for the advice and for reading it’s appreciated	Character_Thought_21	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9975649118423462	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

Hey, just found this, pls lmk if not allowed. But, I recently relapsed and started doing it on my stomach. Now I can’t eat the same amount, nor can I eat without feeling nauseous. Is this normal?

go to a doctor. self harm wouldn’t cause nausea while eating unless you’re causing some serious blunt force trauma, it’s more likely you have some kind of GI infection or stomach motility issue.	Ok_Hornet1757	reply	na	na	na	0.9984550476074219	no	no	no	na	selfharm
When I was in residential and psych wards I used anything that I could get my hands on, but before anyone found out and I wasn’t popping in and out of hospitals all the time, I had a specific blade that I always used and when I was trying to stop I didn’t want to get rid of it because it was special to me.

I don't usually get attached to a specific tool, but it's comforting to me to know I have something I could SH with, even when I'm trying to stay clean. I got a cute box cutter recently for less than half a dollar though and I really didn't want to throw it away, but I did yesterday. I know I wouldn't actually use it for anything else like I tried to tell myself. I still miss it though. I feel so stupid.	Wolfiye11	reply	na	na	na	0.002011889824643731	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

I’ve been cutting on my legs a lot thinking that’s the best place to hide my cuts. The problem is that I’m always worried people will still find out that I do it. I worry someone will walk in on me using the restroom and scream in horror. I want to cut my wrists so bad since that’s my favorite place and the place I get the most relief. I just can’t get myself to sop. My psychiatrist was told me that she was thinking of putting me inpatient because my self harm has become so frequent that I lied about not doing any more so she hasn’t put me in a ward yet.

yup. a lot. my parents have gotten a lot better about it over the years, but when I was hospitalized the first time they said a lot of dumb stuff like “oh if she’d wanted to kill herself she would have done it already”.

I can't wait for the a school to start again bc that means that it will get colder so I can finally wear long sleeves shirts and can finally do sh all I want. I can't wait to cut, cut and cut all the pain, thoughts and worries. I can't wait to feel the sharp cutter on my skin again. I can't wait to see the blood again.

"Last summer if no one was home that meant I would cut. Today, three months clean (only 2 months away from passing my previous clean record) I have just stared into the mirror in our bathroom for three minutes, concentrating on how ugly they are and now i’m crying on the bathroom floor.

I hate them. I hate how they wrap around my thighs and hips. Or how my right hand has a short sleeved shirt engraved in it for the rest of my life. Or how my stomach now looks as if I had a c-section when I am 17, never had sex or been pregnant. Not to say how they stain my chest, something any future partners might have found attractive but definitely not now.

I just feel like no one can ever be attracted to me with them on my skin. I felt ugly before because of my body and how it turned out because of my overeating/binging problem (problem my self harm even started at first). But this is a whole another thing. I keep imagining telling someone I could be romantically involved about them and them leaving me because they found my body horrendous. I can’t even think about someone seeing me like that so intimately. Being so vulnerable.

Today was relatively a good day. I went to a pride parade with my friends and enjoyed myself. I don’t know how I could have ended up on the bathroom floor, towel around me as I cry and type all of this.

But I truly just hate my scars and my body with it."	ohhwhoisshee	post	24.356486654475766	male	White	0.9992783665657043	na	na	na	2	selfharm
"Hey ❤️

First of all - I’m glad you had a nice day with your friends: these moments are so important during healing.

Recovery is a bumpy road and unfortunately I think it will never end - at least it hasn’t for me yet, but I’ve learned to cope with it.

I too have “horrendous” scars on my body - I’m always confined to wearing a long sleeved-tee and not tight blouses as my protruding scars then will show.
I sometimes still cry over my body. My scars. The pain I decided to brand my body with. 
But they are a part of me now and I have grown to somewhat accept them bc they tell a story of how I overcame the darkest parts of my life.

It’s easy to fall into the cycle of deeming yourself unlovable and unattractive, but you have to look deeper into the meaning behind those thoughts, because I think you feel no one will ever be attracted to you bc you’re struggling with you own self-image and then you project those thoughts and feelings onto others.

The truth is that when someone love you, they love all of you.
Scars doesn’t matter. 
You matter.
And you absolutely will matter to someone one day ❤️

Even with my many awful scars, no partner of mine has ever turned away from me bc of it.
And if they did - they weren’t worth it anyway.

I wish for many more good days to you and I wish you a well recovery ❤️"	ohhwhoisshee	reply	na	na	na	0.9992783665657043	strong	strong	no	na	selfharm

"I don't really know what to say since I have never been through something anywhere near as hard as what you seem to be going through so the only thing I can really think of is that, and this might be cringy. If you feel like your at rock bottom and life can't get any worse, then at least the only way to go is up. You can't go any further down then the bottom. 

I know you probably don't want to hear stuff like ""love yourself first"" or ""just get a therapist"" but what else can you do, even if it feels futile, if you try then at least there is a chance of it working. Even the worst archer has a higher chance of hitting bullseye then someone who didn't shoot there shot at all. 

Just know that even if it feels like no one cares, there will ALLWAYS be someone who cares, think of it this way even if 0.000001% of everyone on earth cares about you. That's still 8000 people who care. I don't know who you are and have never met you but I hope you manage to see and find people who will care for you even when you don't care for yourself.

i've done the exact same, on my left mid thigh. it was maybe 2 years ago, and it's very faded, for better or for worse. some time ago though, a few weeks ago in fact, i carved the word 'pig' into my right mid thigh. it's something my mom always used as an insult to us growing up. but when i finished doing it, i stared down at it and there was this *sick, SICK* feeling of utter satisfaction. it was so hard to tell even my own sibling what i'd done, and i haven't had the courage to tell my boyfriend, which upsets me greatly because he's literally my favorite person in the fucking world. i'm just so, so ashamed of it. i still don't know how i'm going to do it honestly. but my advice to you is genuinely, don't let it bring you down. i know it sounds like the same advice everyone has said at least once, but what i mean is, don't let words like these, degrading, singular words, define who you are. you as a person are not ever just that one word, you and everybody else in this subreddit, outside of here, are more than the insults we've been called and/or call ourselves. obviously it isn't a fix-it, nothing is. but it may help you to keep that in mind, you know? honestly, i might not even be making any sense here, so i do hope you *can* understand what i'm trying to say? but anyways, i hope you have a wonderful day, stranger. all my love to you. <333	WitchQueenLuz	reply	na	na	na	0.9988735318183899	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

It’s not that I like the feeling, it’s that I’ve gotten so used to the feeling that it’s what I’m familiar with. It’s the first thing on my mind everyday.

You don’t want to leave the blanket because your afraid of how cold it’ll be once u leave it. I found peace in my depression.

okay so i was in the nurses office today at school, because i didn't feel good and i needed to call my mom. the nurse asked me to take off my hoodie or pull up my sleeves so that i could let her check my blood pressure. i lifted up the sleeve on my arm that had all less cuts than my other arm and kept the cuts facing away from her. i accidentally moved my arm and i think the nurse saw my cuts. i'm freaking out, because she has suicide and sh posters all over her office, so she definitely knew what it was. i'm scared that she is going to tell on me and get me into trouble..	kornl0ver69	post	26.956258422885963	female	White	0.9987516403198242	na	na	na	5	selfharm
i had a similar experience in 8th grade. one day i was randomly called down to check my blood pressure while i had fresh cuts. i was hesitant to lift my sleeves but i did and when the nurse saw it she asked what happened. i said my cat scratched me and she said “those don’t look like cat scratches” and then i made up another excuse. she stayed quiet while she checked my blood pressure and after she finished she asks me “you’re not cutting are you?” and i said no. then she asked me “are you nervous right now?” and i said no. then she said “ok have a nice day” and she never said a word to anyone. to be fair, it was in 2019 and back then people didn’t care about mental health so that’s probably why she didn’t tell. there’s a chance she might not say anything, especially if the scars are old. if they’re fresh then it’s a possibility. i feel like if she didn’t say anything to you, you’re most likely gonna be ok. good luck though	kornl0ver69	reply	na	na	na	0.9987516403198242	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

"We were painting warhammer minis, all of the sudden he asks me for the box cutter that we use to shave off rough edges from minis and literally cut his palm something like 5 times. 
Idk what to do.
I also am scared that I may be the cause, since I've been self harming for a while and talked abt it with him since he's been asking me for updates and stuff on my mental health.
He saw my scars many times, and I even sent by error an image of my wirst while it was bandaged to tell him that I wouldn't be able to hang out the day after with him. I realized how stupid this action was only after sending the image, but I did it bcs it has became such a normal part of my life that I forget it isn't normal at all to other people, and of course I scared him.
Now, days after this event, he did this.
I feel like an asshole, a piece of shit and I can't do anything about it.
Told him to talk Abt it it's therapist and also asked him if it was my fault, and he said that he won't plus that it ain't my fault coz he's been doing it since middle school, but by different means.
Even if it was true I still told him I was soooo sorry, because i must have been an influence whatsoever in this.

From personal experience, I am a 30F who is a mom of an 11 year old. I still self harm in places my child cannot see but unfortunately I do have scars that are visible and one day he told his school he was cutting himself with knives (we came to find it isn’t true, it was a cry for help but as someone who had been before been dismissed for what would be considered “superficial cuts/harm”, I did not ignore this red flag) he had no self inflicted injuries on his body but I just knew he must have gotten the idea from my scars…. I explained to him that I was never taught how to deal with my emotions in a positive way so I took them out on myself. I explained this behavior wasn’t okay whatsoever, that we have a safe space between us, to vent and hold space for each other but it is never ok to hurt ourselves to feel better (god I wish I could take my own advice but when it’s your baby you have to do better). I would tell your friend the same thing. People who suffer from self harm usually aren’t taught to deal with rising conflicting emotions in a positive way..but there are a million different ways to deal with those emotions than taking them out on ourselves…. We cannot teach them the positive ways because a lot of us have been doing this for years, for me, decades. But I can 100% tell the people I know and love, it doesn’t help. It is a temporary…not even fix…to a temporary toxic and horrible alleviation to a problem that needs further introspection of a calm and sound mind. Not every emotion or problem needs to be resolved right then, sometimes we have to sit with the uncomfortable. (Literally typing this and hating that I can never take my own advice). I’m capable of holding space and compassion and empathy for everyone but myself.

He could be lost in his mental health enough to not think clearly/normally and that's why it happened. I've had times where my thoughts feel like they've just crumbled and have become difficult to manage. He could've been in a mental health situation for so long that he lost the order of his thoughts for a period of time and just decided to hurt himself right then and there. Presuming I'm spot-on, maybe he is good at watching and managing himself, but for a short time, he couldn't manage what was going through his head or think clearly about his situation. Maybe it's an issue with overthinking and being overly self-critical that's gone to the extreme over a long period of time and dealt some damage mentally. I'm not sure what causes it.

As someone who has been in a very similar situation, I can tell you that your friend is likely in a very bad place mentally and it would be in your best interest to distance yourself. I have been in a place similar to your friend in the past (though I have never gone as far as to self-harm in front of someone) and I am very ashamed to have been “that person”. The mental space I was in to have performed these actions, though, was absolutely terrible, so I think it would be in your friend’s best interest if there were to seek help and if you were to take some space and distance yourself.

"Hard disagree with this. I'm really sorry, but this is straight up badly thought-out and possibly damaging advice.

1) this puts the onus on OP to prevent their friend from self harm. Not a fair responsibility by any stretch of the imagination.
2) even if OP did decide to take on that role, it has been clearly demonstrated that OP being present is not a deterrent for this person. So telling OP to be around their friend all the time to stop them is setting them both up for failure.
3) this will set up a wildly unhealthy dynamic where OP feels responsible and guilty if their friend engages in self-harming behaviour again, and where their friend will feel guilty and responsible if they self harm again.
4) if someone wants to self harm, they will find a way to do it. Sharp objects are not the only way to self harm, and people will get progressively more creative to fulfill a need."	Suitable_Interview51	reply	na	na	na	0.9992591738700867	strong	no	no	na	selfharm

Feeling sad : try to listen to music that you know makes you happy

"Well I kinda understand how you feel, for me it was also similar because I enjoyed the pain since it made me feel something at least. Now I haven't cut myself in 6 months but from time to time I accidently burn myself or hit myself and this feeling of ""enjoyment"" comes up again.
I think you should find something to replace the feeling of need that you have. I know it sounds easy to say but there must be something you can do to reduce that urge.

"I know that when it comes to self harm, you compare yourself to others all the time, and it only makes things worse. Believe me, those with the most serious injuries would like to be able to stop, and be able to reduce. You're valid, all those who self harm are. When we hurt ourselves on purpose, it's self harm, regardless of whether we bleed or not, if it's deep etc. This is something to be taken seriously, for everyone involved.

But I understand you. I too felt like I wasn't doing enough, and a part of me still thinks so. Self harm destroys lives, because we always want to go further, and it's never enough. Never.

Yeah I do understand that many people think their pain isn't as bad since they don't cut as deep, but that is precisely why I chose to remind OP that the severity of cuts is *not* proportional to the amount of pain that you're in. There are people who never cut at all, yet their emotional pain is still real. When I was 13, I was in intense emotional pain, like it was very very bad, yet my cutting was not as severe as it is now, even though I was in more pain then. When I was 15, I was completely clean, yet I was actually in far more pain at 15 than I am now, when my cutting is very severe. When I was 15, I felt so deeply worthless and bad. But I didn't cut. Sometimes people need to be reminded that depth of cuts - or whether you're cutting at all - is not equivalent to how much pain that you're in xx	Daniel3930	reply	na	na	na	0.9994792342185974	weak	no	no	na	selfharm
"I started using a lighter and have no idea how to take care of them right. They’re not serious, and stop hurting a day afterwards, but they’re kind of obvious little red spots and end up looking a little like scabs? About the size of the top of a lighter, if not smaller. Along with that I have no way how to hide them much because it’s 30 degrees and I’m with my family. 

What I did is put some lukewarm water on it, take some toilet paper afterwards then make it a little wet, and wrap it around the area the burns are (but it’s a little messy and it’s not tight or anything), is that alright?"

If you're sure they're first-degree, you don't really have to do much except washing them with cool water and applying a cold compress, which is what you did. You can also put some petroleum jelly on them. If the skin breaks or blisters at all, they might be second-degree, which is what the scab-like appearance could be?

"Usually if I cut styro it of course always turns into a dark raised scar which luckily I did on my thigh area my family usually doesn’t notice. I tried to moisturize my fresh cuts with Vaseline or baby oil if I’m really scarce (someone please tell me if baby oil works 😭) and apply a bandaid but for whatever reason it never works in minimizing the bumpiness of the dermis scars. I tried purchasing steri strips but they don’t sell any at my local mall and the ones online are expensive. 

If I’m in desperate need I went to the makeup counter and shade matched Maybelline Superstay foundation / powder foundation, color corrector palette, & some silicon based primer to smooth out the texture if there are days I really need to cover my scarring. But I really need a way off the bat to ensure the scars won’t be raised from the moment I make a slash as being caught self harming is my biggest anxiety and will only cause me to do it more.

It's called **THE PART THAT ADMIRES**

**Here it is:**

I sit on my bedroom carpet. It’s dark, so I have on my flash. It’s pointed at my thighs. I look at all the scars and scabs I made. When things like this happen, two beings show up. The part that admires and the part that hates. The part that admires thinks the scars are beautiful. Like art. It looks at the scars and wants more. It wants to go deeper. It wants to cut through so many layers of skin all you can see is blood and bone. It wants people to stare and wonder what is wrong with me. It wants people to know I’m not okay. It can become distraught. It can become obsessive. It will not stop until it gets what it needs. The part that hates is not as strong as the part that admires. It can be, but when the part that admires is around, the part that hates knows better. The part that admires’ presence is too overwhelming, and it would be considered a waste of time to try to overpower it. However, the part that hates is smart. The part that hates thinks about how cutting myself will affect me in the future. It wishes there were no scars. It knows they’ll be there forever. It knows I can never wear shorts again. It knows not only will people look at me and wonder what’s wrong with me, but it also knows they’ll think I’m selfish and will judge me because they just don’t understand. It knows I’ll lose friends, family, and lovers over this. It knows the pain I’ll have to go through when my family eventually finds out about this. It knows I should be trying to get better. And yet, here I am. Eyes looking over my canvas, trying to find a spot to make the first brushstroke.

Slice.

It makes a faint sound when it cuts. Like what you hear in movies when the main hero takes out his sword. I put my thumb above the cut and pull the skin up a little. The skin spreads open a little, and I see white. I feel proud. I did well. I went deep enough to satisfy myself (today).

Slice.

There was another sword sound. I immediately see red, not even a second of wait time. I feel my heart drop. I put my thumb above the cut, and pull. The skin does not spread open. There is no white. I am not proud. I did not do well. The part that admires starts to panic. The panic transfers over to me. I am frustrated. 

Slice.

Slice.

Slice.

Three cuts. I put my thumb above three cuts, and not once did the skin spread. Not once did I see white. I did not press hard enough. I did not drag my arm fast enough. I am not enough. The part that admires is screaming now. But it's not just feeling panic. It’s desperate. Now, it’s sobbing. It’s on its knees begging for one good cut. Just one. Then, it’ll stop and finally rest. The screams, sobs, and begging all overlap to make this tornado of failure. So, I took my brush, found a spot, pressed a little harder than I would have liked, and dragged my arm as fast as I could.

Slice.

I hear a familiar sound. I wince. That’s how I knew I had done a good job. I only wince when I go deep. I look at the cut. I didn’t even have to put my thumb above it, the white was just there. Then, just like that, the part that admires stops screaming, stops crying, gets up, and dusts itself off. It wipes its tears, locks its eyes on the cut and just… well.. admires. I see blood start to fall from the top and watch it slowly fill the cut and overflow. The beads are more like tiny balls on this cut. After a little bit, the balls connect with slightly thinner strings of blood  in between each of them.
I decided to look at my full painting. Fresh cuts, scars, scabs. The part that admires becomes more mesmerized. After a good 15 seconds, however, I decided to interrupt it when I started to get cold from my ceiling fan. So, I take my towel, wet it, clean up the blood, stop the bleeding, and get in bed. 

In bed, I feel that the part that admires is satisfied. The part that hates takes this as an opportunity to grow. It grows until it’s almost the same size as the part that admires (it never grows to be the same size or bigger). The part that hates reminds me that the deeper the cut, the worse the scar. The worse the scar, the more visible it is. More things for people to stare at and ridicule. The part the admires immediately defends my actions, saying that doesn’t matter as that’s not an issue I’ll have to face anytime soon. The part that hates says it has my best interests at heart, then the part that admires says... And now both parts are going back and forth. They take turns growing and shrinking due to each other’s words. I can never guess which one will be towering over the other. I feel my eyes start to burn. This is all very overwhelming. Tears rolled down my face, soaking into my pillow. I want this to end. As I drift off to sleep, the arguments are muffled. I think about my thighs and the part that admires. Then, I realize, as long as the part that admires exists, that canvas will always look empty, and we all know it’s only the part that matters anyway."

I got to feel safe for the first time in my whole life, and it only lasted six weeks, and I haven't managed to get hired because my anxiety's so bad I stutter and I can't convince interviewers I'm confident.

"Hey, be gentle with yourself. The shame cycle isn't benefitting you. <3

Cutting is a coping mechanism. Your body is used to extremely high levels of stress due to your abusive environment. Once you got out and that stress was reduced, yes, a large part of you felt better. But since high stress, pain, and fear are your baseline, your body didn't know how to react without it, so it compelled you to manufacture some stress.

I'm sorry your job search hasn't been good well. It's so hard to fake confidence in those months after leaving an abusive situation."	marvineeyore	reply	na	na	na	0.9990214109420776	weak	no	no	na	selfharm

"Been actively self harming since I was 15.
I managed to stop for around 4-5 months this year.
The last two weeks have been extremely rough for me anxiety & depression wise. I felt sick to my stomach constantly and was feeling horrible. 
I had a group presentation at my tafe (higher education in Australia) that actually went really well.
Thought I’d be relieved afterwards but all I felt was self-pity and angry that I have anxiety and have ruined myself and everything. 
I ended up relapsing the last two nights (in obvious spots), I can hide this with long sleeves but I still feel so immature. & I have placement coming up in approx 2 months where I will need to wear short sleeves.
I have this need to be comforted and I can’t get that from anyone.
I can’t imagine how mortified i would be if anyone from my class seen or will see.

I know self harm isn’t something to be embarrassed of. This is my own shame talking, and I am just stressed. I don’t want to offend anyone."	tragixc	post	20.778790328081	female	White	0.9990682005882263	na	na	na	4	selfharm

Not sure how long ago you cut but if it’s gaping I highly recommend butterfly bandages or wound closures of some kind! It will keep the wound closed and that will both help it not get infected and potentially help with scarring.	mosbiee	reply	na	na	na	0.9983538389205933	no	no	strong	na	selfharm

I can only assume part of it's psychological, because we know the scars are there and so we remember the pain associated with them.

Scientifically, I can only guess it's because they're still healing and so your skin and scars are still very sensitive to touch.

"a couple days ago i (16f) was with my girlfriend (15f) after not seeing or talking to her for about a week and we were like making out and started getting below torso and she suddenly started making excuses why i shouldn’t and i was chill like ok then like it kinda happened again and then she completely stops and like there’s clearly a reason she doesn’t want me to like go further down and keep in mind usually there’s never an issue and she was clearly into it and she had already went further down with me at that point (we r lesbians lol) anyways she completely stopped and started acting weird and was like there was something wrong and she kept saying “i don’t want to say it out loud” and then started sobbing and we were laying there for like an hour and i was so confused why she was sobbing and i asked if i did anything wrong and she told me i didnt so finally i figure it out that it was because she had major self harm cuts on her thighs that were recent and she confirmed without telling me that it was true and it was so terrible and we both were crying. keep in mind that she has never done this in the time we’ve dated (about 7 months + 6 months we broke up in between), i’ve seen her body so i know that’s true. so this was a new thing within the past couple days and she explained that she was feeling terrible and it was stupid and dumb and it was a one time thing. and i had no idea what to say i tried to comfort her and tell her i love her and i’m so sorry and tell her i was there for her but it was so painful to me knowing she was in that much pain and i could do nothing about it. and she has BPD so i know she can have episodes where she feels like everyone hates her. i just honestly don’t know what to do because we are both young, i can’t talk to anyone without exposing her and putting her at risk of suicide watch or something idk and i don’t know how to deal with something like this. i saw the cuts because later we did end up going further and that just made it so real and they were really terrible and honestly i don’t know what to do. i want to support her and love her but also i feel like i failed her in not making her feel loved enough that she would resort to self harm in that moment, especially since she’s never done that before in the time i’ve known her or had a big history of doing it. it hurts me knowing she would ever do that to herself and i love her so much and i am scared she is going to do it again since she already did it once, despite telling me it was a one time thing. i’m the only one in her life that knows about this. i feel terrible and i never want her to be in that much pain again, i just have no idea how to support her, as i’m terrible with my words and also have never dealt with something like this before.

Me on the other hand, it can be seen, but she's aware, and she didn't look at my arm while asking me other questions (I had spoken about it once).

I understand that you feel bad, but honestly I think you seem to have done things well. You comforted her, told her that you loved her, that you would be there for her.

Soap and water won’t work unfortunately, Soak the razor in a mixture of half warm water and half white vinegar. Add 2-3 tablespoons of baking soda. It will get super fizzy and start attacking the rust. Let it soak for an hour or two, but don't let it soak too long.

Yeah, you should throw it away. Even if you manage to clean the rust off, the metal is already corroded and it might leave particles in the wound.

I’ve been with her for about two months now and I’ve only worn long sleeves. Sometimes when we hang out in my car I’ll take my work jacket off if it’s too hot but it’s usually dark so there’s never been a problem. One day early in the relationship we were at McDonald’s and we were talking about random stuff and I don’t know how it ever got to this topic but she said “yeah I don’t have much experience hanging out with emos”. I just looked at her laughed nervously and changed the subject. Then slowly I got more comfortable with her again and today after work I just had my short sleeved shirt on. I don’t know if she wants to talk about or what, but I haven’t heard any comments from her and I hate confrontation. What do you guys think?

Personally when I was younger, I'm 27 now, selfharm and depression ruined many relationships. If selfharming is in your past and or you have occasional relapses I don't think you should feel need to hide. But that's easier said than done. I'm definitely not confident with my scars. I'd say if she's your gf and this is serious she'll learn about your sh regardless if you open up about it or not.

"Showing your scars openly, not under clothes, impolite? Would you consider it impolite to be expected to cover it? I often forget I have them on my arms sometimes and was wondering if not caring who saw them would be considered impolite?

If they are fresh-fresh then no but I  give it like 5 days of healing before I go in shorts or crop tops.

My most obvious scar is more than 10 years old and I’m way past the point of caring to cover it. At this point it’s not going away and I don’t want to cover it for the rest of my life.

jup, same when I was working in customer service I saw plenty of costumers with scars, too. Somehow that has changed my perspective a little, when I was younger and on a rare occasion I saw someone with scars I thought that the person would understand me like noone else and I'd be imagining what it would be like trying to befriend them. Now my perspective is more like, plenty of people with different backrounds, opinions, personalitiys, likes, dislikes are be cutters. So now, when I see a person with scars my thoughts are more like - 'just someone with the same problem as me'. I no longer assume I will get along better with them because of the scars, rather I'll have to get to know them more to see if we click.

For me, it was my sense of worthless - both on an intrinsic level and within social circles. Any time I messed up in a relationship, made someone else upset, or did anything that created disappointment brought me to self-harm. I couldn’t stand the emotional pain. I still have urges to this day, especially when I have failed in some way or another.	PIGEONS_UP_MY_ASS	reply	na	na	na	0.9994712471961975	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

Apologies for the rant, but just trying to avoid relapsing. Bout 671 days clean, and having a brutal night. Having a really strong urge to cut again, but I'm fighting it as best I can. Trying to type out all my thoughts to expell the energy rather than sh, but man, I haven't felt the urge this badly in so long, but I'm fighting as best I can. I think the hardest part is knowing the sh would help and make me feel better. Just so much on my mind all at once and I know how to fix it, but for whatever reason I'm not supposed to help myself. Not sure what to do, but trying my best to stay strong. I keep telling myself a little scratch doesn't count. But its a slippery slope, so I'm trying not to allow anything.

after i cut today i noticed that the paper cutter ive been using has started to rust. i think it has possibly been like that for a while because i remember seeing the same brown spots thinking that it’s just dried blood or dirt. when i focused on the brown spots when i washed it and noticed that they didn’t go away, i obviously threw it away, is there anything else i should do?	digitallymadecat	post	25.372455806844094	male	White	0.9994365572929382	na	na	na	2	selfharm

Omg me too. Yeah they can get crazy itchy. I try not to scratch directly but just rub my sleeve over them sometimes to make it not feel so itchy. It's itchy because they are dry, so I put some lotion over the cuts, and for me that doesn't make it itchy for a while.

bandaids holding in place a piece of cloth works in a pinch. don’t use any paper products (toilet paper, paper towels, tissues etc) bc that stuff can get in the wound and dermis (styro) gets infected much more easily than epidermis. neosporin is good as well or any type of antibacterial cream or ointment like that. keep it covered until the bleeding has been stopped for at least 24 hours	TheDuddyDude	reply	na	na	na	0.012847591191530228	no	no	no	na	selfharm

"This is such a niche experience, but I want to know if anyone else has had something like this.

About a year ago I was hospitalized for an allergic reaction. It was full blown anaphylaxis with hives, I couldn’t breath, my face swelled up and my eyes wouldn’t open. They gave me an epi pen in the leg and I began to recover and start breathing again.

Something strange that happened on my arms and legs, all these red lines from old cuts completely lit up from all the inflammation. On my legs I probably have 30 scars that are visible on a normal day and arms I probably have like 10. Right after anaphylaxis I saw hundreds on my arms and legs, like their scars were so faint that I couldn’t see them normally but the inflammation brought them to the light.

I haven’t actually cut in about 5 years. When I look down at my legs I can remember a few instances of cutting and it makes me sad sometimes. But seeing just how many times I did this terrible thing to myself, hundreds of times, was a completely surreal experience.

Wondering if anyone can relate?"	Monk-Mobile	post	18.14824024302941	male	White	0.005532774142920971	na	na	na	1	selfharm
Yes! I’m allergic to some ingredient in quite a few laundry detergents and not only do I break out in hives, my scars also puff up. It’s strange because most of them are more than 10 years old.

"I get infuriated when people tell me ""it's going to be okay"" or clearly pity me (not necessarily in a bad or demeaning way) when they see my scars or sh comes up in passing. Someone I talk to online aways reponds with some sort of ""oh no poor thing u need a hug"" and it's absolutely enraging. It feels like I'm being treated like a child. I don't have anger issues whatsoever but this kind of stuff makes me nauseous. I'm not proud of my scars per say, but I'm far from ashamed of them. I don't care if people make fun of me for them- I make fun of me too lmao. I think part of it is that sh was, and to an extent still is, part of me, and I can't stand it when people see part of me and jump to the conclusion that I need comforting or help. 

I don't actually know why I react this way aside from my views on this, seeing as I know that people are usually just concerned and want to know if I'm okay.

To everyone, please take the necessary steps and help yourself. If you're feeling down and like it's not worth it and there isn't any meaning behind anything you do, just remember - you surely aren't seeing the bigger picture.

Hate to break this to you, but time. Wait a couple of months and it will probably have faded a lot. It can take a year or years for it to completely disappear, it really depends on how deep it was and where your scar is (if its somewhere where your skin moves a lot, like on your elbow, itll heal slower). It definitely cant hurt to keep it hydrated tho (bodylotion works fine), that will prevent itching and helps the healing process	Dusty_Doodles	reply	na	na	na	0.014935921877622604	weak	no	no	na	selfharm
When I get bad, I like to make a list of why I shouldn't fall back on it, but lately, I can't find a single thing. I don't mind scars and couldn't care less about people asking, the pain doesn't bother me either. My family's reaction is the only thing on the list right now. 	asilentwhipser	post	11.466996914476004	male	White	0.9986513257026672	na	na	na	56	selfharm
"- you could accidentally go too deep and hit smth
- it could get infected
- it’s really addicting and hard to stop
- it’s not a healthy way to cope with feelings 
- after a while you have to go deeper and deeper to feel anything 
- it leaves permanent scars that you might regret later even tho you don’t mind rn"	asilentwhipser	reply	na	na	na	0.9986513257026672	no	no	no	na	selfharm

It might be fatal and I have nerve damage in my left hand from it which sucks. They can also get infected.

In addition to what everyone else said, it also makes it SO much harder to learn how to emotionally regulate with things that ARENT self sabotage. I can tell you as someone who was addicted for about 10 years and is absolutely clean now, that dropping all forms of self sabotage has completely changed my life. Now sometimes I’ll get those urges were so familiar with, and I put on a record, make some tea and write about how I feel. Being able to respond to your own suffering with love and compassion for yourself is sincerely magical. Above all else YOU DO NOT DESERVE TO BE IN PAIN!!! You don’t deserve to suffer. If there isn’t anyone around you who will support and comfort you during the painful times that you feel like hurting yourself, the least you can do is allow yourself some warmth and kindness.

When you self-harm, it may FEEL better or right or whatever, but it’s just a mind trick. It’s just messing with the chemicals in your head. Whether you need medication to balance out the chemicals in your brain or you’re trying to deal with trauma or you’re just in a shitty situation, self-harm isn’t doing anything to get you out of that.

dying from self harm addiction, permanently damaging your body functioning from nerve damage, it starts to slowly rot you when you get an addiction (speaking from experience), and let’s say you don’t care abt your body/health or whatever because of depression, continuing will never allow you to heal and move on with your life. and self harm is bad because it makes you think that it’s okay. not wanting to be clean is one thing, but convincing yourself that self harm is a good way to cope is another, that’s addiction.	asilentwhipser	reply	na	na	na	0.9986513257026672	no	no	no	na	selfharm
I know a lot of you on here are quite young, but I am not. The first time I self harmed I was 10, and I am now 29. I haven’t harmed myself in maybe a year, which I find very impressive. The most important thing to remember is that it’s hard to conceptualize at any age that you will not always be the same person. I’m in a corporate work environment now and very cautious about showing the row of scars I gave myself down my inner arm when I was 16-17. Both shoulders are also scarred, and both thighs. People WILL stare, and they WILL mention them. Even if they mean well and love you. My life is good now. I don’t want to look down at my thigh and see a huge scar I gave myself when I was 13 and didn’t get stitches for when I was too scared to tell anyone. It makes me nervous going out on a lake day with new friends who may not know how scarred I am under my clothes.	asilentwhipser	reply	na	na	na	0.9986513257026672	weak	strong	no	na	selfharm
I often think the same. Like in my head it's better than some of the other addictions but I know it's still not a healthy choice. To me the worst part is that it makes you lie.

"I think the biggest one for me is to be able to help others without being a massive hypocrite. You’d have the experience & knowledge from when you did it, & from when you finally quit. It keeps you in that headspace to : the self destructive one and even though subconsciously it might lead to other more self deprecating things (not saying it will just maybe)

I was just like you, didn’t see a reason to want to get better, I was doing just fine like that. But it changes you. You’ll never really be the same. Not only from the physical altercations but mental aswell (whenever cuts or anything seemingly normal is mentioned having ur mind taint it into a sh lends) and the longer you do it the stronger everything will be.

I don’t remember, once or twice maybe. But only once in the school bathrooms, I was angry at my teacher for moving me for having my head on my hand, on my jumper, we don’t even do writing in this class so.. why cant I do what I always do? No other teacher has shouted at me for having my head on the table, he moved me to the other end of the same table and put my jumper on the chair next to me and then he didn’t even shout at me for having my head on the table then.

"In class, in the bus and in a park. For context it was during my first time cutting so it was still pretty light cuts.

In class: I wasn't biting my nails yet and they were naturally sort of long. It was also during the first days I had really noticable tics, and on this day the teacher replacing our math teacher was the first one, capable of humiliating you if you act a bit ""abnormal"" or ""weird"". I really didn't wanted to catch his attention so I started cutting my wrist with my long thumbnail. The slow pain helped blocking the tics, and it ended up cutting a bit. I liked the pain so I continued.

In the bus: same day, I continued cutting with my nail, hiding it with my sleeve. It bled a bit but I had a tissue in my hand. Technically the first I self-harmed and I still have the scar. Ironically the lightest and smallest cut I ever made is the most visible and bumpy one.

In the park: during a time where I was really addict to the pain, where I really needed to feel physical pain whenever I was too anxious. So I made an earring with a safety pin and beads, and I used it to cut my hand/arm whenever I felt too anxious. First time I did it was before an oral exam for my french class, I stopped by a park near my school and started making light cuts on the side of my hand. There were workers on lunchtime nearby, I got a bit scared but they left me alone. The other times I used this technique, it was always in the bathroom so nothing special.

And I don't know if it counts or not, but the day before I was admitted at the psych ward, I made couples of cuts near my elbow, so that I could scratch of the scabs if I felt the urge to cut there. And if the nurses noticed the fresh blood, I would say that I accidentally scratched it off"	MememVar	reply	na	na	na	0.923950731754303	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

"(42 F) So I'm in a poly relationship with 2 individuals. One of them is my best friend (42 F) and life partner, though we aren't romantically involved. We are raising a 5yr ASD child together. Our mutual romantic partner (46 M) died last September.

We both ended up dating the same person again after, and while she fell in love with him, he fell in love with me & vise versa. So things ended with the 2 of them, and he and I still want to see each other. My primary is hurt and upset, and I get it, but she's also Borderline so part of this is taking the upset out on me....which honestly I believe I deserve anyway. Part of all the hurt is my fault, I should've just swallowed my crush feelings for him in the beginning and denied myself any and all desires. They only get me in trouble anyway.....if anyone has seen The Antichrist movie, that scene where she cuts her clit off, I wish I had the strength to do that.  Like if I could no longer feel pleasure then I would not desire, freeing me of all the drama and trauma.

I don't want to lose either of them, and it's hard to figure out what to do. Part of me says just die, then no one has to deal with it. But I can't leave my kid, so no permanent nap for me. Can't cut bc my partner is recovering in that area, and I don't want to be a hypocrite. I don't want to chose between them bc I love them both deeply....they've both been hurt so many times in their lives and I don't want to add to that.

So I came up with the next best thing.
Eat til I'm too big for him to want me anymore. Then he can break up with me (here's to hoping he isn't the good guy I think he is and wouldn't break up with me for gaining alot of weight) and my partner won't have to deal with me & him being together. Or me being with anyone else either. She can just have me at home all the time and my daughter will have me all the time. He won't get hurt by me breaking up with him, and she gets to have me all to herself. Win win. I'll just stay out of the diabetes range. I'll be alive, and there for everyone who needs me alive. Robotic existence is better for others than none...

I was never meant to make myself happy, I know that now. I only exist to make others lives easier or better, and not for myself."	tinypumkinmother	post	26.19782354433466	female	White	0.0036383492406457663	na	na	na	3	selfharm

"Didnt want to relapse before getting my cast removed but oh well whatever, at least I was clean for almost 2 weeks ig lmao 

Anyways, it's gonna be a vent/question, I have a lot to say so sorry, but I also really need an answer so yeah 

Why did I relapse ? Well, it's stupid, really. Three days ago, I finally had a conversation with my boyfriend by text, it'll be 2 years in zpril since were together, and I never told him how bad I was doing. I Always told him I was struggling in the past with self harm but it was the past and now I'm Always happy and never doing Bad, and since im Always acting so childish and carefree with him he never questioned it. Well, three days ago he messaged and told me ""On God, you're not alone, if you have a problem just tell me"", it was late at night and idk, I just told him things about my parents, and then that I didnt have any energy to do anything and I was just spending my days doing nothing but waiting, laying in my bed. He told me he really wanted me to see someone, I told him thzt I didnt need that or his worry and that he should just stop paying attention to me, and then he told me he refuse to ever leave me alone, and that he wont stop bothering me until I see someone. I didnt even tell him that I still struggle with self harm, or that I want to stop existing, and that I planned to do it even, and he's already thzt worried and I hate it. Yet I want him to know and I want him to stop me and force me to get better. It's stupid.

Well, I Saw him Yesterday and we didnt talk about that. Then he never texted me after that, which isnt strange because we can't talk 24/7. But I really wanted to talk about it more. To tell him everything. But since he never talked more about it I felt like hé didnt even care about it and then I felt so angry, I started crying.. and I just hurt myself again. And now I feel guilty, because I know it's not true, I mean I think it is not. And i dont even know if I should tell him I relapsed, or all the feelings I didnt tell him yet. I dont know how I should tell him. I'm scared actually, of ruining everything. Of ruining the image he has of me. I already ruined it enough by talking him about my lack of motivation I can't do more. But I dont know why it make me feel so Bad that he don't know more, and that my state is also getting worse. Anyways aha, ig the question is should I tell him ?"	SnooBeans1920	post	14.282168193554998	female	Hispanic	0.9972633123397827	na	na	na	1	selfharm

For those who dont know, in vol 3 of the story, charlie confesses to nick that he used to self harm. I haven’t got any problem with it.

Maybe its entitled to think that it should be the norm but I’ve seen one tikok with a tw and none of the rest I’ve seen have one. I feel like its just not a lot of effort that for me and for(I’d imagine) other people would go a long way.

"I do love a lot. I love cheap apple juice, yellow sunsets, tiny dogs and laughing with friends. I love people. I love love. And there is a little spark in me that wants to stay here.

But I keep searching for signs to leave. I tell myself I'm not enough. I tell myself I don't love enough. And when I try, my love only hurts people. Because I can't do it well. I can't even get myself to eat food. How could I show my love when I'm too tired to even eat? I don't want people getting attached to me. I don't deserve them. And they deserve better.

Everyday I try to find reasons to leave. So that I would feel in peace with my desicion. Does anyone else do this? Kinda wanna stay but convince themselves it's probably better not to??? Feels like my brain isn't making sense.

"he thinks people who do it are emo's. Well he's a twat. But I came to talk about his problem with making jokes about it. He hasn't done it often but here's an example

So he asked me why I have been taking his knife so often (I only took it 2x and never used it for cutting) And I told him I literally took it once yesterday. (He then told me I took it twice, once with my friend and the 2nd time just yesterday) 

I tried to tell him I used it to cut a twig with it I found. And I tried to explain it and he just said ""I literally don't care"" BROTHER YOU MF ASKED HOLY SHIT.

And what makes it worse when he literally made this ""joke"" about me cutting my self is that my nephew/uncle (idk the difference) was in the same room. I literally said ""I don't cut myself"" 

then my brother made a 'cutting gesture' on the forearm, and said ""she's practising for (I forgot what he said)""

And if I tell on him he'll just call me a snitch even though I've only snitched about 10% of his problems to my mom. She would've spoken to him A LOT more often if I always snitched on him.

I honestly hate him so much. Why can't we just be friends? Why can't we just be on the same page about things. Why do you always have to make everything worse. And when I think we're finally getting along you just fucking ruin it. And then our mom wonders why we aren't friends.

Haha. Yah, that is a pretty normal take for him then. SH is a rare thing to properly understand at an age that young.

"*This mainly applies to cutting, but other forms of SH are applicable.*

I’ve been seeing some posts over the past few weeks of people SHing in classes/school and I just want to say please don’t do that. I get it; feelings are running high and the urges are strong but please please try to put it off until you get home/in a more private space.  A lot of you are young af, like early/mid teens, and you’re at school a lot of the time. There’s so many reasons why you shouldn’t do that but main ones are:

You will get reported to your parents if caught. This is quite a point of contention amongst a lot of you and whilst I see how it can be a spanner in the works for some of you, you also have to realise these are adults with a duty of care. It’s literally their job (and in their role as an employee of the school) to report it. Sometimes if they see you with visible SH, that’s enough to have to speak up about it. Doing it in school is risky af bc if they see you’ve done it in school, there’s far more of an incentive to report that and keep an eye on you. If you’re hiding it in particular, this is more than likely going to get you reported to your school’s welfare service and/or your parents. 

It’s triggering to other people. To clarify, I’m not talking about SH already made that are healing or scarred; that’s a another conversation. I’m talking about actively SHing in front of others. SH isn’t normal. There’s nothing to be ashamed of about it, but it’s not really something people do in general (was a wild concept to get to grips with myself). It can and will be shocking and distressing to people who could report you, but also get triggered themselves. You may not know who struggles with SH and it’s always good to err on the side of caution and try not to trigger others with that. Even if they don’t deal with SH, it’s still a surreal thing to witness and that could stir up attention that may not sit well with you. 

Schools are unhygienic af. I left secondary school years ago but mine was gross af. I should imagine most of them are bc it’s loads of students sharing spaces, some aren’t necessarily considerate of the spaces you share so mouths aren’t covered when people cough; germs land on surfaces. Toilets; self explanatory. Especially if you tend to have a good cleaning routine with SH, it can be hard to prepare those on a sanitary area/surface. What if you drop your tool? Yeah, schools are just ew. 

What if you need medical attention? This is kind of related to the 2nd post but what if you hit dermis that needs stitching? You have no choice but to speak up to get it appropriately seen to. Other people can be very distressed. It’s stress and attention that could make you feel worse and want to SH more. 

This isn’t to shame people or anything, but to just be far more aware of what SHing during school can entail. You guys got this 💖"	jayfromcyberlife	post	25.514596867043878	male	White	0.4176444113254547	na	na	na	71	selfharm

"Also, you can get in big trouble for bringing blades/knives/lighters to school because they might consider it a weapon. 

Some schools will also be really strict about it for liability reasons, so they might not allow you to come back to school until you’ve been assessed by a psychiatrist.

"I've done it a few times when i was stupid and yeah it sucks. it had a terrible effect on my social life and me in general. 
In home economics and art class i used hot glue to sh by applying it to my bare skin on my forearms and letting it dry, peeling it off, and applying it to the same area- not a good idea. left a nasty scar. i also cut with scissors and it was really cringe; im pretty sure a few people saw me and I am so ashamed now. biting is also another one- i can't believe i did all that in public. I'm so ashamed of how it affected people.
i didn't get caught by teachers because i was extremely sneaky, but if i did i can't even imagine the situation i would've put myself in.

I’m past my school days now and have been for a few years, but I also used to SH at school and I completely understand it. School was the biggest trigger for me and it was the only way I could get through it. I’d take blades into school and do it in the bathroom a few times a day, during lessons when there was no one about. I’d then stuff some tissue up my blazer and position it in a way that no one would see it poking out and I got away with it.

They had to end off, I get it’s difficult and it happened to me and I hated who reported me but they honestly had no choice. It’s part of the safeguarding rules. And if u are gonna do it at school pls just do it in the bathroom away from everyone else the main reason I started sh was bc I saw the girl sitting next to me doing it under the table.

I did it a lot when I was still in hstbh. I was at a point in time where the only time I could stay even 6hr clean was when I was sleeping. I'd usually go to the bathroom or just scratch or discreetly pick at scabs if i couldn't go somewhere private or whatever. Honastly I know you mean well and all of this is true but it isn't going to change anything. Sh is an addiction.  Everyone here knows the risks well you don't know we're doing and we don't know it's sucks ass. It's not really something that we can just snap out of. Kids who sh in school are bacicly the same as the kids who go to the bathroom or lift up there shirt to vape tbh.

I did it once right before an exam. the teacher was walking from desk to desk check if we had hidden notes somewhere. saw something white on m lap beneath my arm. told me to show it. saw paper towel covered in blood, few seconds eye contact and went to the next desk. I think she didn't want to think about it. the next few years the number of cuts increased a lot and they called my parents but they were aware and nothing had helped . skip forward to last year of hs , teacher absent. I'm cutting and use that blood to paint. the kid next row almost fainted and later on found out the lady working security couldn't sleep for 3 days after hearing what I did  and was afraid of me.. sorry for the long read but what I'm trying to say is, yeah don't do that sh.t publicly for the sake of other's sanity	jayfromcyberlife	reply	na	na	na	0.4176444113254547	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

I see why they have to do it tbf; if something happens, they’re automatically at fault/responsible.

Some students may need that middle man to help them open up to their parents. Some could do without having their parents know because of a hostile environment.

You have to understand that when you tell the people that love you that you self harm, they will react. Good parents love you the most on this planet. It's been close to a year since my parents found out and I have been clean for 5 months. My dad still can't look at my scars, my mother goes ballistic when I cut myself on accident with a glass or something. But I know it comes from a place of love.

"So I’m around six months self harm free (yay!) but due to malnourishment my scars aren’t healing. They’re still pretty ugly and raw even if they don’t hurt as much. I’m pretty ashamed of them and I don’t like strangers seeing them.

Anyways today my parents booked a small tourist boat tour where we would go on this small floatable boats and just have fun going to remote beaches. We would obviously be in swimsuits during the tour and my scars would be exposed. When we arrived at the tourist rent location we got greeted by the person who would be driving our boat and taking us to the beaches. She looked young, maybe 22 and her arms and thighs were covered in healed scars that were pretty obviously self harm. My family noticed but I told them not to comment and nobody did. It wasn’t.t awkward or anything. At the end of the tour, the woman (Alexandra) exchanged a few quick words with my mom. My mom came to see me after and turns out she had told her to tell me “things get better, we heal” just that. Just five words.

I almost cried. I wish her the best and I’m so happy she seems SH free and seems to be enjoying life. 

Just wanted to share this with y’all. (She was right too, I am six months free and it DOES get better)"	Solal-King-Raccoon	post	11.797161449390174	male	White	0.001491156523115933	na	na	na	1	selfharm

"I thought I was able to keep the harmful thoughts under control.  I thought I was getting better.  But turns out I was just finding things to distract myself from my trauma and feelings. On the surface that may not be a totally bad thing if it keeps me from harm.. but I was desperately trying to stay afloat to the point where if I couldn't distract myself I'd just sleep all day.  I don't know how I convinced both myself and my therapist that I'm healing. I feel like a liar and a fraud. 

Right now I'm just numb because I had a breakdown earlier about one of my abusers & the shit he pulled.  Now I'm emotionally depleted.

"I want to rip into my thighs due to stressful family situations.  My parents and sister just treat me less, and are always yelling at me. I cut my stomach a while ago due to my dad's shit he yelled at me, he ranted everything about me that annoyed him, at me. I CAN'T wait after he leaves for two weeks again, but before then, I have to have him with my mom and sister for a week, as he and my sister will go back home for school while I am here for a thing for both legs with my mom. I CANNOT wait any longer than one week to cut myself. I can't. How can I hide deep dermis cuts (that I WILL make once my dad leaves) on my thighs? They will be deep dermis. I expect to cover all of my thighs. I can't wait any longer than one week. Once my dad leaves, I am cutting. I cannot be convinced not to. He always stresses me so much and I need to let out all that steam by cutting once he leaves, I got new tools, I am ready. If he stresses me and screams at me for being basically a mistake and worthless at everything, goodbye thighs. I am done.  I will cut. It's my only way to cope with my dad's crap.   
So I was wondering how I could hide my cuts for four weeks, so no one sees them, because I did a surgery to lengthen my bones to even up with my femurs as I did those three years ago, etc, etc, so I have to take a shower with a seat, as I cannot weight bear, so I was thinking I could take my showers once my mom leaves for a few hours, as she does with me all the time :/ ,  so she doesn't see the cuts until they've healed enough to look like they are four weeks old, I don't know if I can use makeup to cover the ones I will make in a week, What can I use? I never wear pants so if I wore pants my parents would know I am actively self harming. I am fine if I am sent to a psych ward later but I am doing a surgery I am actively needing to do so I can't let the physical therapists see my cuts either (they stretch tibia muscles, I will cut on thighs, so I need some long shorts that I should buy this week with my parents) so do I use make-up? Maybe I could go to the store with them and get some longer looking shorts with them this week, so I can cover my cuts I WILL HAVE, next week. I need shorts that cover my thighs completely, I cannot wear pants due to my parents knowing that I hate wearing pants. There's going to be a lot. I don't know what to use. I need help. How have ya'll hid your FRESH and LARGE AMOUNTS of SH scars from your parents and family? I really need help please!!!! Especially those with strict parents, How have ya'll managed to hide your scars from parents (who know that you have self harmed before) so they don't know you are doing it on your thighs. Please help me. If my dad stresses me, I need this, it is my only way to get the pain I feel inside, onto my skin, so it hurts less internally and feels like I am dealing with the pain I feel, by cutting, instead of bottling it all up inside me without leaving a mark.  
So I was hoping, Please someone, anyone, any advice and help?  I know self harm is bad but this is my last and only way to cope that I have. I am hurt inside and I give up. I don't care if I am sent to a psych ward, I just need this to survive at the moment. Self harm is all I've got."

I cut on my left arm but I’ve been clean for a while (1 year almost). When I used to cut I didn’t go beyond a certain place because I my parents found out the first time when I sh on my wrist so because of that I have many scars in one specific area. I used to cut over old scars a lot and I’ve recently realised there’s this one spot that hurts when I press down on it. I don’t know what it is because nerve damage doesn’t necessarily describe it. All my cuts have healed and it’s been so long but it still hurts. Anyone else have something similar?	Yonexx0	post	11.748020389423928	male	White	0.008294249884784222	na	na	na	1	selfharm

"As someone who was a really sick kid, and self harmed during my teens honestly there wasn’t always ways to hide it. Sometimes I’d wear a baggy hoodie and s/h further up my arm, past my elbow so I’d only have to pull my sleeve up halfway while getting bloods done. Or I’d come up with an excuse that the arm I s/h on doesn’t give blood out the veins as easily as my non harmed arm so I’d prefer them to use the non harmed arm. If they insisted on using the harmed one I’d say I wasn’t comfortable because everyone who takes blood out of it has to stick the needle in a lot and it hurts. Sometimes I’d plan my harming around blood tests, but it wasn’t always fool proof with being ill.

As for scars and not open wounds, I’m almost a year clean and there’s never really a time they aren’t pointed out, it’s clear they are healed keloids but nurses nearly always ask if I’m okay, if they hurt n stuff. Which is a bit nosey imo. You can’t cover them with makeup, as they have to clean the area anyways. But hey, if they are scars, there’s not much anyone can do about -healed- scars. It’s already been done. It’s one of those things you have to accept with self harming pasts. You can’t rid yourself of them, they are there, for the rest of your life. There is no way to magically make them disappear. You can try stuff like bio oil to possibly lessen the appearance:) it worked for my acne scars but unfortunately hasn’t done anything for my s/h scars. Worth a try maybe?"

"I've been thinking about an encounter I had with a doctor a few months back while in the ER to get stitches. She was this old lady with typical old people glasses and short white hair. She herself was unusually short as well.

On her name tag it said that she was both an orthopedist and a psychotherapist, for some reason.

&#x200B;

Here are some of the things she said to me:

* compared me to people traumatized by ww1 (a little random but fine, even though I don't even have trauma)
* asked why I didn't take my bike instead of walking there because her very pregnant sister once drove her bike to the hospital to deliver her baby (?)
* complained about me wasting her time by giving her more work on purpose
* cutting is a trend, it didn't exist ""back then""
* told me to calm down in a dismissive tone while I was moving my legs because she was shooting local anaesthesia into the wound (which is clearly painful)
* indicated I did this for the attention I get at the ER (only good point she made, but still an annoying and reductive thing to say)
* complained about me sitting up abruptly at one point because I was feeling worse and worse due to her comments, saying I should quit the circus acts (literal translation: ""stop it with the circus"")
* told me that she was wondering whether she could let me go home 'like that', as if it wasn't her who caused me to be this tense and distressed in the first place.

In conclusion: She sucks ass.

&#x200B;

After coming home I had a hard time calming down and getting ready for bed. Also I was feeling really suicidal. Which is why I went for a short walk around 1 am and luckily managed to fall asleep when coming back home for a second time.

&#x200B;

She was the first medical professional that I have met who had this attitude towards SH.

Sure, some are more strict than others, but nobody has ever come close to being this hostile in their word choice and mannerisms.

I tried to ask her why she was acting this way, but she dodged the question by giving me some kind of non-answer that didn't actually deal with the subject matter.

&#x200B;

I really to this day don't know what her problem was. Though those are some possible reasons for her behavior that I came up with:

* The last time she practiced in the mental health field was so long ago that she had no idea about the current scientific view on SH
* She was trying to scare me out of coming to the ER again, not understanding how stupid of a tactic that was. It did not change my attitude towards SH or getting stitches, the only thing it did was making me wish I could see her again so I could confront her.
* She really hated stitching up cuts, maybe"	Druesenfieber	post	26.663378857435546	female	White	0.9994783997535706	na	na	na	1	selfharm

I have this terrible part of me that believes if people see them, they won't feel the need to hurt me. They'll know that I know just how worthless I am. They'll see that I already know my place and therefor won't have to put me down.

If I hurt myself, they won't. If I'm already punishing myself, they won't.

I guess it's sort of a safety blanket for me. I'm so terrified of people hurting me or being cruel to me that I don't hide the scars. It's not to say that I show them off, or that I'm proud. Of course I'm not.

"the old 'i got scratched by a cat' excuse i've used a few times, including very recently. 

actually, i do have a sort of morbidly funny story: 
when i was in 6th grade, (i was 11), i self harmed for the first time. i lightly cut myself in places on my face with a regular ol' shaving razor. because of the way the razor was sorta shaped, it looked like thin, 3 lined scratch marks. i don't know why the hell i did it on my face, but like whatever. 
my cover story was that i went to feed a squirrel and it attacked me. that's what i told my immediate family and i don't remember how but it got spread to the rest of my (fairly small) extended family. because the cuts (again) looked convincingly enough like scratches, everyone believed my lie. i'm currently freshly 17 years old and me getting 'attacked by a squirrel' is still a very much running joke by about nearly everyone in the family, whom have all used said joke more than once over the years. i can't tell you how much i've been teased over it and just the SHEER amount of squirrel themed apparel i have gotten over the past 6 or so years is sorta insane. the only one in the family who knows the truth is my younger sibling, MJ, and tbh, it was a little bit funny to me when i'd told them because of just her sheer shock. i've also always found it genuinely VERY morbidly hilarious that what my very first self harm experience was unknowingly made fun of by nearly everyone in my family, and they won't ever even know. 💪

also i've never really been bothered by any of the teasing, partly because i know that if they all knew the truth, they would be MORTIFIED AND TRAUMATIZED and in need of immediate therapy.

☆ TL;DR: my entire family (excluding my sister) to this day unknowingly makes fun about my first self harm experience 6 years ago because they've been under the impression that that was me getting attacked by a squirrel. 
i find it hilarious. additionally, i've also gotten absolutely countless squirrel centered gifts & items, all of which i have indeed thrown away at some point."	Sport_Obsessed4472	reply	na	na	na	0.9991003274917603	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

I don't think compression sleeves are that suspicious, especially if you wear them to the gym, you can just say they help you with joint stability or something. I just got cooling arm sleeves that are intended for cycling and sun protection, so they don't cause any pain, they have rubber on the top for better grip and no one seems to find it weird when I wear them. I'd recommend cycling equipment stores for arm sleeves. They still look like compression sleeves but don't compress anything.	pinkheels1983	reply	na	na	na	0.9993213415145874	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

"So my wife and I are both in our early twenties, I’ve never self harmed so I have limited perspective here. We’re pretty open with each other emotionally, but I recognized the signs in her (she started only wearing long sleeves in July was a big one) and had to straight up ask her if she was self harming while having a talk. She said yes and I’m locked away all medications and taken all of the blades I know about but she also didn’t tell me where they were I had to find them by going through our stuff. Including her top drawer which felt bad going through her stuff but it had to be done. I’ve been encouraging her to seek therapy again which she agreed too and we set a time goal that she has to be on the schedule on a therapist by September 1st. Just so she has time to talk with friends first and writing in her journal so she is getting used to talking things out again and not bottling it up. I have two main questions for this sub I guess but I will take general advice as well. 

1. What can I do to support her when she’s home alone/should I be letting her be alone in a room even when I’m home? I work only part time right now but she’s home alone the entire time because she’s currently unemployed, and I’m worried about her safety incase I’ve maybe missed a blade that she’s hiding. We have cameras we can put up in the house but I don’t want her to feel surveyed and even then there are places that cameras couldn’t see anyway. 

2. Is self harm considered a reason to put someone on an involuntary psychiatric hold? She’s scared that once she goes back to therapy her self harm would put her at risk of being institutionalized. She’s been in one before and has permanent trauma and physical damage from it. She’s also chronically ill and dependent on IV medications so she would end up being neglected in a ward because she’s “too medically complex” (something she got told last time because she even had her picc line). Being put in one of those wards could potentially kill her from medical neglect so it cannot be an option."	Medicsavage	post	20.995805403085217	male	White	0.018864242359995842	na	na	na	6	selfharm
"1. It might be scary to leave her alone, but she still needs privacy and time to decompress. Realistically you can’t be with her every second of every day, and that’s okay because you shouldn’t *have* to be. If she can’t keep herself safe for a few hours then she really needs a higher level of care like PHP or inpatient. 

2. No, self harm generally isn’t considered enough of a reason for an adult psych admission. She’d likely need to be acutely suicidal before she’d be a candidate for an admission. And to touch on your concerns about her medical stability- not all psych wards are the same, plenty are equipped to handle serious medical complications. I coded on a psych unit a couple years ago and ended up fine because the unit was part of a major hospital and they had a rapid response team. I understand medical trauma and all the anxieties that come with it, but being completely closed off to the possibility of an admission (or other higher level of care like PHP or IOP) might end up hurting you both down the road."

"1. I appreciate the reassurance, you’re right. She can keep herself safe in those few hours or she won’t and we’ll talk about it after or she’ll tell her friends or something else.
2. Thank you, I again do appreciate the reassurance but unfortunately, unless like you said she becomes acutely suicidal, I won’t allow her to be in one of those facilities. I’m so glad they were able to bring you back when you coded but she requires around the clock medications and sterile care. I am an EMT and though it’s been about six months when I was still working as one I saw the inside of every single inpatient facility nearby (for doing transports) and none of them are equipped to care for what she needs. Idk if this is something you would know but do you think that god forbid if she ever did need inpatient care that we could request it be on a medsurg floor where she’s on a nurses shift and just having a sitter in the room. She’s previously had sitters in her hospital rooms because of trauma but never has it led to an involuntary hold."	Medicsavage	follow-up	na	na	na	0.018864242359995842	weak	no	no	na	selfharm
She could absolutely request a med surg floor, or the admitting doctors would decide that’s what she needed on their own. It’s pretty common for medically unstable psych patients to be held on a different floor, either with or without a sitter depending on their needs. Obviously it all depends on the facility but if it comes to that (and there’s really no guarantee it will, she might respond really well to outpatient care) it’s really not an abnormal situation. The downside is that she might not get to participate in group therapy and other activities they do on the unit, but they can usually arrange for individual therapy and med management visits :)	Medicsavage	reply	na	na	na	0.018864242359995842	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
OK, that actually makes me feel a lot better. I think having that knowledge of being able to be on a MedSurg floor while she still wouldn’t feel great about it it would hopefully not make her fearful of death.

Throwaway because I know people on here. I was “clean” from self-harm for over 3 years and I messed up last night. I’ve been in my head too much over my personal relationships and my work. I was left alone to my own devices, got intoxicated, and hurt myself with a knife to feel something. I can’t tell anyone in my personal life. My therapist will probably recommend that I be hospitalized because even after hurting myself I still want to do it and it’s leading me down a bad mental path. It’s like a craving.

Talk to someone. You need support in this, it’s the best thing for anyone. I understand it may feel hard to reach out to people you are close with, if there is no danger reaching out to them about this I urge you to consider it. As for your therapist, they may not even hospitalise you. But if that was what they recommend would it really be so bad? There’s a reason hospitals exist. They are damn lonely sometimes but It’s for your own safety to prevent you from further hurting yourself, and to give you the recourses to go away and work on your health. That being said there is plenty of recourses available, helplines, apps, coping mechanisms. Although if you’re having a rough time I’d definitely recommend talking to someone, reaching out for support. Friends, family, therapist, dr?

"Last september i was in the psych ward for the first (and to this day last) time and stayed there for about two and a half months. at the time it was helping my social anxiety and i could handle social situations better. i thought it was a good time and i healed...

Now the past few months i got flashbacks about the time there and i started realising how that time fucked me up mentally. I see triggers everywhere and in everything, like the brand of water i used to drink during that time or certain names, songs, food etc. 

Sometimes i want nothing more than to go back to the ward to get the help i so desperately need, but i'm too old now (children's ward and i'm 18) :/ I miss it so much and i don't even know why. how can one miss something that they hate with all of their heart at the same time? it doesn't make sense to me

I've been clean of self harm for pretty much half a year with a few slip outs, but nothing major. The thoughts of relapsing won't stop and i don't think i can handle it any longer.

If you need to, there are many wards for adults. You can voluntarily admit yourself for screening and they will determine if you're a danger to yourself, and if so, admit you. I understand.

So yeah, pretty much as the title states, I’ve been self harming for over a decade, I can’t believe it’s been that long. I’m 24 and started when I was 13. Whilst I have gone some years in between clean, the urge has never left me. It just proves how addictive it really is. It all started with one tiny cut with a metal hair clip, and slowly escalated from that to snapping rubber bands on my wrist that left bruises, then pencil sharpener , to knives, blades, scalpels, burning, and hitting myself in the head , and on my body with objects. I just can’t stop, even after being years clean, I always return to it and feel as if I always will. I am now diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which has just made the self harm even worse as the depression and mixes states just become too much. So please please please, if you are considering self harm, just know , once you start, it will forever be the first thing your brain turns to whenever something in your life goes wrong. It can effect anybody, I hold down a job, a long term relationship, and I’m doing a masters degree.

 I forget that people don't constantly try to kill themselves and wish they could tear out their vocal cords because they'll never sound how they want.

Im so sorry to hear that. Try using some websites instead of sh. Like for example https://www.fataltotheflesh.com/ you basically cut the screen instead of your skin. I just made a post about 20 websites instead of sh too. Or you could try to blast music though your ears. Go on a walk. What really helps for me is to surround myself with other people so im not able to sh. Take a cold shower also helps. You can also just google some ways to calm the urges.

Not only that, fat cuts are very dangerous you could hit a lot of major blood vessels that could cause you to bleed out or suffer from blood loss, so as soon as you hit fat put a towel on it to stop the bleeding, tell someone and/or go to the hospital.

I really fucked up the other day and started to cut. As I Said in my previous post I did never cut before. I used different ways. But cutting was a second or first Idk 

Anyways I did cut and it honestly felt good but I know that I shouldn’t cut because of the scars and blood blah blah blah. 

But the urge to cut is so strong istg. It’s like I was craving for it the whole time. Every time I have a knife in my hand for cutting sth I am like oh I should do it. 

I really really need some help right now. I tried a cold shower and it felt good but I can’t just take a shower 24/7

TW: Sometimes when I have urges my body reminds me of where I’ve previously cut before and it’s like my skin craves being cut in the same places. Like I can imagine and almost feel the sensation of the blade on my skin and my skin then starts to feel itchy in those places. I also feel burning sensations in those areas. It’s becomes really tempting when these physical symptoms arrive, because the sensory relief of cutting makes them “go away” or feel like the sensation is “completed.”	mewhimsy	post	18.528493074304095	male	White	0.003802431048825383	na	na	na	4	selfharm

Thank you for opening up about this my friend. Have you for tried counseling/therapy to help with this problem. Do you have family, friends or church family/pastor you can turn to for support and guidance during this difficult time?  Are there more positive constructive ways you could deal with your frustrations that are healthy and not harmful like maybe painting or something like that? As for me, I have struggled with anxiety, depression, self-harm and not wanting to live especially in my teens but now that I'm in my late 30s, married and with kids I'm glad I took the time to work very hard to get better.  Therapy, family, friends and church family helped a lot but what helped best of all was God's great love and gift of salvation to anyone who believes.  It was one of the hardest things I have ever done working to get better but it was worth it and I think you can work hard so you don't have to deal with this anymore as well.  I have some other resources that helped with this issue that I could share if you'd like (including a number to help you get counseling anywhere in the US: 855-382-5433). If there's anything else I can do to help I would be delighted to and feel free to keep me updated if you want someone to talk to.

"As the title says. I was verbally attacked by a group of girls in the train station today. I was walking in a crowd and all of a sudden I see the girls infront of me spin round and ask ""did I just call ___ a ___???"" I said sorry what? No. The girl looked me in the eye and said ""yeah well you're a fat obese fuck"" 

I instantly started sobbing in the train station. All because of some mistaken identity. I'm not a huge person. I'm around 15-20lbs overweight.

I'm currently sitting on the train and all I want to do is slice my stomach up.

"I just crave it. I daydream slamming myself against a wall, or scratching my body up with my hands. I daydream about self harm constantly. I want to feel the stinging of searing my arm under boiling water. I want to feel the pain of a rubber band whipping and snapping against my flesh. I crave the feeling of soreness and the feeling of pain in my body. I also like imaginging drowning and the feeling of my lungs giving out. I just can't stop thinking about hurting myself. 

This isn't right. I don't know how to stop it. I don't even know if I want to stop it. It's only ever when I get intrusive thoughts or feel some type of inner turmoil. 

I also battle the desire to see marks on my skin. Whether it's cuts, burns, just red marks from slapping, whatever. I want to see it on my skin.

These feelings get so overwhelming and I can only think of hurting myself. And I'll go as far as I can to punish myself until I feel I have felt enough pain. Or until I've reached a limit. Unfortunately over the years I find that my limit grows bigger.

If I'm out in public, I'll escape to a bathroom just for a short bit of relief. I can feel when my body is craving to be hurt. I'll be shaking and anxious until Im able to quell the need.

Paranoia, self-harm, suicide (mentioned), eating disorders

my mental health has been awful. i am depressed and i am convinced there is a man in my room. i feel like shit. my mom was yelling at me cause i told her i was doing homework but i really spent 3 1/2 hours fucking around on different games. i hadn't really moved from the couch and she kept telling me how unhealthy i was being. i was trying to zone out so i didn't have to hear her yelling cause it triggers me and she told me to go clean my room, and got mad when i couldn't answer. I cut my arm 42 times, my leg 35 times, my upper thigh 4 times, and hit myself with a metal flashlight until i got bruises. a few hours later, i was sitting downstairs on the couch -contemplating if i could get my hands on some meds and kill myself- when she came down the stairs and started yelling at me again because i was still sitting down. she had me stand up and tried to make me walk around the room. it was embarrassing. later again when she wasn't mad, she asked for a hug. i told her no, and started moving away from her. she kept moving towards me, and blocked me between a chair and her. i kept saying no, but she wouldn't let up. i have CSA-related PTSD and issues with my boundaries. she eventually forced me into a hug and i hated it. i was shaking the whole time. she later saw i had cut again and got upset. i started apologizing and she said ""i am so done with the sorries"" and then started crying when i didnt hug her goodnight. i have been masking for two days and she keeps telling me about ""how much better i do when i take care of myself"". shes just happy im eating better and i worked out but i think im relapsing. and she can't handle my eating disorder. i wish i was dead."

I relate a lot to this but I guess the silver lining could be like, the hassle gets annoying and you might self harm less.

Well healing time varies depending on where you cut, how you wound care, your health, your age. I'd say ideally you'd want close the wound and keep it shut and bandaged up till it's healed.

Have begun burning myself instead of cutting . I have been rolling pieces of paper in to hollow balls and setting them on fire and heating my knife over it and placing it on my wrists. Each time i do it i build up my tolerance and can hold it for longer.

I know it's not new information but please be careful, burns can get infected really easily and it can be hard to control the amount of damage you cause. As dangerous as cutting is, virtually all cuts will eventually heal on their own, but a 3rd-degree burn needs skin grafts (or months of wound care) past a certain size. And since you're already building tolerance, make sure you at least keep the size under control if you're able to.	fau-dow	reply	na	na	na	0.0033815104980021715	weak	no	no	na	selfharm

"TW: suicidal thoughts, SH, addiction, drugs

Hi, I’m horribly depressed, probably the worst I’ve been in a very very long time. My family Asian family are mad, disappointed and hurt by my decision to follow my dreams career wise, and not stick to the original plan that I had. Although I’m not very close with my family, I can’t stand the idea of them feeling this way, probably cause I’ve always done things to appease them and make them proud of me. It’s making me horribly anxious and thinking that I’m gonna be cut out of the family.
For context, I am an addict, but I’ve been clean of drugs for over 5 years now, but absolutely do have the thoughts to use again here and there. Recently, over the stress of my family situation, I’ve been having a lot of suicidal thoughts, even going as far as googling methods. Yesterday, I counted out 25 paracetamol just to see what it looks like if I were to take it all at once. 
Instead, afterwards, for the first time in my life, I took a knife to my thigh, and made some cuts. Not deep, they probably won’t even scar, but they definitely bled a little. I’ve cleaned them up and bandaged them. But I still have this constant desire to do more and go further. 
What do you guys think I should do?"	Flash4432	post	30.726906771646966	male	White	0.9952974915504456	na	na	na	3	selfharm
It’s important to understand that these experiences can and probably will lead you to a new kind of addiction. You will see this as a gateway for the rush and comfort that hurting yourself creates. The reasons are different for everyone but it certainly made you felt different thus making you wanna try it more. I have been in the same situation, the best you can do is sit down and think within your thoughts, close reddit and be with yourself, am I really going to do this, question yourself again and again until that answer is no because there is no good reason to start this shit. I have suffer and wished I didn’t and hope you dont too. Others will say to find motivation to stop, get a hobby, etc. but unlike other addictions whose side effect is getting hurt, self-harm’s only purpose is too hurt. I’d say is that find the desire to be better and start from there. Thats what only matters, the desire to be getter, and the desire to get the fuck up and stop the bullshit in our lives that makes it feel like hell.

"I just did it fot the first time, it's 2am my family is sleeping. I've been struggling with mental health for a time now and I just tried cutting my wrist for the first time. To be honest I don't really know why I just had this sudden urge to do it. It's bleeding a little and my arm feels heavy, however I feel better for some reason. That's it I will try to sleep just a little if I can.
I'm not even sure why do I need to post this, I think I feel proud to myself for whatever reason.

There are two genders though. It’s just biology. You don’t see intersex dogs do you? Also intersex people’s parents typically choose their gender at birth and raise them as such. Besides, intersex people make up a very small minority rather than a majority. It’s like apples. There are green ones and there are red ones.

there are spaces where we are accepted. there is love and laighter and hope for all of us in this community. you dont need to turn your head at every stupid transphobic/anti-intersex comment you read online. you can focus your attentions on where the love lives. much luck and happiness to you OP ❤️"	Geckonamedjin	reply	na	na	na	0.9947133660316467	no	no	no	na	selfharm

Gender and sex are 2 different things and both of them aren’t binary. And yes you do see intersex and transgender animals. Yes, lots of parents with intersex kids will force the kid into a gender identity they don’t identify as and doctors will perform unnecessary surgeries on intersex kids which can affect them in the future if they don’t identify as the gender they were forced to present as.

The whole “only 2 genders” thing is especially stupid because not only is it specifically targeting and excluding trans and non-binary people, but gender itself isn’t even a real thing. It’s just a made up set of boxes that contain a set of traits and physical characteristics so we can more easily and quickly categorize the world around us. We created “the two genders” so there’s really no reason why there should be only two, or why they need to exist in the first place.

This being said, I haven't self harmed in almost a year. I've been doing it off and on for 11 years. My wife tries her best to deter me from relapsing but my only motivation is to not disappoint her, I really can't wrap my head around why it's such a negative thing for me to do. The idea that hurting myself rather than others or rather than doing drugs or something doesn't seem like anything more than a little weird, so long as I don't cut too deep and damage something.

When you’re hurting bad enough you want to slice yourself open, it triggers a strange feeling in yourself. People cope with that feeling in different ways, some want others to see their pain perhaps, a cry for help so to speak, others maybe view it as some sort of war scar, a badge of honor, each cut another,  trauma faced, and as someone else has commented, there are a sect of cutters who view it as an aesthetic, not to say they aren’t hurting too but in many ways over the internet and through music and other sources of media it has been throughly romanticized.

I’ve even gone through periods after not being depressed where I didn’t do anything but now I’ve started again and it just confuses me. Maybe it’s anxiety? I don’t know. I go all day without thinking about self harming but then at night I get this overwhelming urge and want to do it multiple times. I don’t really feel a void of emotion until maybe night time. All I can think about though is the act at this point and wonder if I’m just doing it because I want to be seen as mentally ill? I’m just really confused.

"About 7 months ago I was in an abusive relationship and my suicidal ex had been harming himself. During that time I had fallen into a deep depression and felt hopeless, so out of curiosity I kept telling myself I needed to understand his pain. Although, in retrospect, it was anger, as I was furious with myself for not leaving the relationship on my own volition.

I self harmed only one instance with a pair of scissors. (Shoulder and one on arm) Although I was left with 4 snips/scars. (Some had slightly bled.) After harming I was very quick to forget about my actions and focus on the mental health of my ex. So didn't use any creams on the wounds etc when I should have. I would post the image of the scar as reference as it isn’t really obvious that it’s a sh scar, but I don’t wanna go against the rules. Right now most are skin colored except one sticks out more and is whiter. It’s been a little itchy recently, although that might just be because I keep thinking about it.

Despite it being such a small scar it still makes me feel so sad that I was unable to accept this pain and forced it onto my skin. Personally, I'd appreciate knowing any methods of regressing the appearance, etc.

Finally beforehand and nowadays, l am in a very good mental space and l'm a very happy person. So honestly this whole thing is kind of shocking to think about sometimes and feels very situational."	Embarrassed-Owl-3144	post	26.458873613671994	female	White	0.00910254754126072	na	na	na	2	selfharm

So I was wondering if you had any way to maybe casually ask about it without bringing too much attention to it and maybe a reason for why I'm asking?	animelover36912	follow-up	na	na	na	0.005216788966208696	weak	no	strong	na	selfharm
you could say that you want to cook smt, and then take baking soda and use it later. or you could say you wanna do a science experiment (baking soda and vinegar plus food coloring).	animelover36912	reply	na	na	na	0.005216788966208696	no	no	no	na	selfharm

I felt like this far too many times. I wanted to end it but the thought of being the reason my mother cried was the only thing that stopped me. There are no easy answers just an outside viewpoint of what helped me..... I couldn't see a way out, the darkness was always there hanging heavy. So I made a bucket list. If I was so determined to end it all I was going to try live first. So I gave myself 6 months to live the best 6 months I could on this planet. I added silly things and big things of stuff I'd wanted to do but put off. Adventures and happy things to do. If at the end of 6 months I still felt that way then I'd have given myself the best 6 months I could. If that bucket list changed me and pulled me up from the darkness then that was a win too. Either way I would have defeated it and left it behind..... It's just a suggestion...	itsgracie_hey	reply	na	na	na	0.9989062547683716	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

I feel so dissapointed. I don't even know what happened, I won't really discuss anything in depth but I relapsed in cutting, and I'm trying so hard not to beat myself up for it. My amazing boyfriend did end up coming over, I confessed to him I had relapsed and he was very kind, he told me its okay and comforted me. But I feel like a failure. It makes me feel like I didn't grow past this 'phase' as a teen when I genuinely struggle with this. If anyone has any good coping skills or good mantras for after a relapse and not beating yourself up I'd greatly appreciate it, therapy is gonna be really rough my next session and I need some encouragement to be able to have a very honest conversation with my therapist.

Umm, hai, I was able to get into the university I wanted. I wouldn't say it was difficult, but I've been suffering from self-harm for the past two years, and my whole left arm is scarred as a result. I'm seeing a psychiatrist at a private clinic, so far I've been diagnosed with anxiety-depressive personality disorder and suspected anxiety psychosis, as I've been having hallucinations lately. Anyway. There's a compulsory medical examination at the university, I'm afraid they'll see everything on it. I'm afraid that with all this I will never find a man who can love me, because even in my family: stepfather who beats me is dearer to my mother than me. I had a suicide attempt that ended in failure, if I may say so... I don't know what to do with all this and how to enter a new phase of my life with all this. I live in Russia, thank you all in advance and apologize in advance.	Byrso_nimpha	post	18.081353178820507	female	White	0.34709182381629944	na	na	na	6	selfharm
Hello, don't worry about the medical exam, if there's a way you can tell them you don't feel comfortable showing sking maybe that could work if not you can ask for discretion. Maybe your psychiatrist can write a note saying you are working on it so the school doesn't make a big deal of it. I'm sorry to hear about your stepfather, I hope you can find a way to get away from that and that your mom is so safe. And of course you are still lovable with your scars and diagnoses, you sound highly empathetic and being emotional can help us understand others better, so I'm sure you'll find a lot of people who love you. If anything gets too dangerous please ask for help to a teacher or a doctor or police.

"The words Self harm could not be more clear and Self explanatory... 

Self harm, when you harm yourself.

It doesn't matter if there's blood involved, or if what you did doesn't scar. If it hurt and you did it on purpose then you self harmed. This also isn't some club that you need to be eligible for by cutting yourself to a certain level or somthing, there isn't a prerequisite. 

Sorry if this came off as harsh or rude. But it's getting silly the about of people not understanding this simple concept."	Friendly_Tie_2346	post	19.646727363317176	male	White	0.005084683652967215	na	na	na	11	selfharm
Exactly. In addition, according to the cornell research program on self-injury and recovery, banging or punching objects and engaging in fighting or aggressive activities with the intention of getting hurt are also counted as self-harm (in particular, nonsuicidal self-injury).

"I don’t really know how to start this off, but when I was little, I used to cut myself with kitchen knives cause that’s just what I thought depressed people do. When my mom found out, all she really did was ask if I was gonna do it again, and got me meds. (This was 3 years ago) about last year I found out my brother cuts himself because I realized he had straight lines all across his arm when his sleeve was rolled up. I told my mom about it, but I said not to say anything and just that she should know cause I was concerned. She then went upstairs to talk to my brother about it and he said it was about our cat we had to put down at the beginning of the year. My mom said that my brother said he would stop and it was like a “one time thing” but after that I kept seeing more and more recent cuts. I know I shouldn’t have, but I looked through my brothers phone and I saw pictures of his cuts and all over his thighs too. A while after, I found a knife in his room so I took it back to the kitchen thinking all this would stop, but it still didn’t and after a bit I just forgot what had been happening. Then today I looked through his room just for fun and I was looking at his figures, and I moved one, then there was the razor blade. I tested it on my skin and it cut me extremely bad and it wouldn’t stop bleeding for like 10 mins. I know my mom wouldn’t ever really take things like this seriously, and even the other day I asked why she still had a knife in her room from the food she ate, she said “I was cutting myself and pulling a (my brothers name).)”
I said “that’s not funny.. things like that aren’t a joke.” So I definitely don’t think I should tell my mom at all. I’m not sure what to do about this, or how I should talk to him about it?"	Wabtytl	post	12.481134994124684	male	White	0.998406708240509	na	na	na	17	selfharm
I wouldn’t take it away. It’s a bad idea, it could 1 trigger him more if it’s just an addiction that he covers with humor, and 2 make him feel like it’s something to be ashamed of and feel bad for it which makes him more likely to hide it than get help.

With my personal experiences, if hes aware that you know hes doing this you could talk to him about it, dont take the knife or blade away but rather try to do some activities he might enjoy with him for example playing basketball, play some minecraft, get in some trouble, watch anime, literally anything at all that you and him can have bonding time with each-other can help  distract him if hes really having a lot of fun.

Definitely don’t take it away because it won’t make him stop. He will either find another way to sh or just find another razor. Not only that, but he will know that people are breaching his privacy/trust, going through his things without his permission. I know you’re concerned and only trying to help but looking through his phone and his bedroom will only make things worse. It’s very sad that your mother isn’t taking something like this seriously. If you used to cut, you know what he’s going through and I think having someone to talk to is something he probably needs right now. If he won’t go to therapy or see doctor, then unfortunately there’s not a whole lot you can do other than be there for him. And if he doesn’t want to talk then just let him know that when he’s ready, you are a safe place he can go to. Only he can make the decision to stop. Forcing his hand won’t work.

"Why would I wanna tell anyone I self harm?

All adults in and out of my life all talk about how you should seek help if you self harm even other people who are around my age talk about how you should get help but why the hell would I wanna do that?

I already feel so guilty for doing it. My family is the main cause of me self harming but I know if I told them they would feel horrible and question I do this and what they did wrong. I hate making people feel bad and I don't think I could handle telling someone they caused me to self harm. 

I can't tell my therapist because of the whole deal about ""everything is confidential unless it it hurting you or others"" Also I know the people in my life and how they would react (for the most part) and it would just make everything worse it might even push me over the edge.

I will just keep dealing with it myself like I always do ""If I can still breath, I'm Fine"" 

Also I don't want people to say I should tell someone or how much it helped or didn't help them, maybe just people who feel the same. Just wanted to make sure I'm not alone. <3"	Suspicious_Juice_734	post	21.23674176269326	female	White	0.997025191783905	na	na	na	2	selfharm

But what surprised me the most is that I absolutely didn't feel any pain. My skin was just gaping a second later. I didn't hit anything important and it stopped bleeding quite fast. I had styros that bled much more. It was a small and short cut so it doesn't need stitches


So guys be careful because it's quite easy to accidentally cut deeper than you intend to even if your tool is not super sharp"	Majestic-Sand8246	post	9.136227040574363	male	White	0.009503345936536789	na	na	na	6	selfharm
I wanted to ask about what styro and beans are, im confused, even when I’ve been doing it for a while. I used a nail yesterday, and after a while I didn’t feel a thing, is that what you mean by this?	Majestic-Sand8246	reply	na	na	na	0.009503345936536789	no	strong	strong	na	selfharm

"Styro is when you cut you can see white underneath the blood. ""Beans"" (slang for fat) is the layer underneath styro and is when you can see yellow fat underneath that often looks like beans. Hope it helps. PS if you ever hit fat go to a hospital you need stitches"	Majestic-Sand8246	reply	na	na	na	0.009503345936536789	weak	no	no	na	selfharm
What you’re describing sounds like you’re cutting into the part of the skin that has way less nerve endings. Especially if you cut the same place multiple times in a row you’ll feel it less and less because most of the nerves are in the outer layer of skin. It would often make me stop because not being able to feel it unnerves me lol. I think what happened to OP is that they cut with a sharp blade very fast, which can sever the nerves before they react - therefore you don’t feel anything but warmth. I did it once and it freaked me out a lot, since you find yourself sitting with a massive wound and you don’t feel it at all. It’s the same thing that happens when you get shot interestingly enough - it doesn’t hurt, at least not right away.	Majestic-Sand8246	reply	na	na	na	0.009503345936536789	no	no	no	na	selfharm

Yeah the layer of skin after the very first one (the epidermis) which is very thin, is the dermis - and that one looks white underneath the blood. It’s what people in the sub often call styro (though I think it’s a stupid distinction, since all cuts that bleed are per definition down to the dermis), because it looks a bit like styrofoam. I just genuinely find it kinda interesting, and also I think it helps to know what’s happening so we don’t panic at our bodies reactions, but I don’t condone any of it lol. Ideally no one should cut deep enough to see the dermis that clearly, and ideally we shouldn’t self harm at all… but you know… life do be a bitch sometimes	Majestic-Sand8246	reply	na	na	na	0.009503345936536789	no	strong	no	na	selfharm

So somewhere I've heard that at around 90 days people are most likely to relapse on drugs and addictions. Ive been feeling really irritated and upset and feeling like I should start again lately for the last few days, and I just checked my counter and I've just reached 90 days today. Ive felt like crap these last few days and I dont know if that has to do with anything going on in my life or if its that.

"Hounestly I feel like the 90 day thing has to do with the chemicals in your brain and I feel like it could relate because self harm gives you adrenaline and other hormones (I'm not a doctor so idk if this is 100 true) but for me when I frame my self harm as an addiction in my head it makes the want to do it stronger, I start to hyper focus on it when I keep track of ""clean time"" and especially when I ""relaps"" I go into a downwards spiral and I've tryed so many times treating it like an addition to get better and hounestly I've self harmed maybe 4 times I can remember this yeah and  ithink that's alot better then counting the days then starting over when you ""relaps"" if you just want for yourself to not do it and when you feel the urge remind yourself why you stopped, instead of ""I have so much clean time I can't loose"" I feel it creates a guilt cycle in me atleast. Cuz whenever I did ""relaps"" I just said fuck it I already messed up my 5 months clean I might aswell do this everyday again but when I don't keep track and I just tell myself it's okay to mess up and I don't loose anything and nothing bad happened I tend to not do it again for a really long time.

"we have know each other for around 7 years, we met when still in high school, and since then, she would have serious behaviors towards sharp objects, she would show to class with razors that had been clearly broken from some objects, after the pandemic she stopped being so open about them, but until now, out of the blue, she will comment with me how much she likes sharp things, she always buys them when the chance appears, last week, I touched the topic about buying a knife for myself without giving a clear reason for it, and she supported me a lot

I sometimes think I'm just being paranoid, but I remember once in a school project where we had to use plastic knifes, she didn't think twice and cut her hand when I questioned if it would really slice something 

nowadays, she doesn't have any exposed scars (that I know), but her behavior really, really worries me

I'm getting anxious, I want to talk with her about it, but she always tries to change topics any time I say I want her to be safe, she only seems to want to have those happy silly moments with me, but I can't keep on staying by her side knowing that she may do something

"My mom found out about my sh about two months ago, and I've been clean since (huzzah)

But she keeps on pestering me about the scars, not even like cutting myself or having razors. Just my fucking scars. She constantly asks me if I'm putting products on them to make them disappear faster and that I need to make them disappear as best as possible. 

But it feels so fucking bad. Like on one side, them fading alone at any rate makes me want to cut, let alone speed running it, they will fade! Leave me alone please! And also just.. how she wants them gone so much.. it makes me feel like all she sees are my scars like I'm nothing but them.

 I don't think of my scars as pretty, but I don't think of them as ugly either. They just are. They're scars. They exist. I've never been self conscious about them until the way she looked at me and spoke about it. It hurts, I thought now that she finally knows atleast I don't have to bother hiding it. But just the way that she looks at them it makes me so self conscious I still want to hide them from her.

Sometimes cutting is the only thing that can do it because it snaps you back to reality but that doesnt mean its the best thing. Sometimes your mind tells you its the best thing because youre used to it or because it needs someting significant to realize that u can make it. For a self harmer there will be times where u have to relapse but that doesnt excuse that your progress to normality should still be based around trying to self harm again even if you do it once in a while. When in a situation of crisis and you feel utterly alone, do what you have to by all means, but when u calm down always remember at that point its a choice whether or not you reach out or stay alone	jazzypurplepanda	reply	na	na	na	0.9977697134017944	no	no	no	na	selfharm

"Well, using a bandaid or more all the time slows the healing process, and the propensity for infections can increase, especially if you don't replace them. I would suggest wearing some clothes on top of them but you mentioned that it's hot outside so that's probably not an option at the moment.
   
I would keep a bandaid as you mentioned during the day, but I would probably try and take them off at home for the longest time possible. If you live with your parents or something, try to take them off once you go to sleep or get some time alone.

for reference: I take naltraxone as an addiction medication. also note: today we had guests over and my cat was hiding so i stuck my hand down there and she hissed and scratched me. i kept doing it and stopped when it started bleeding alot and i got a similar sensation to when I c^t"	SinkPopular8438	post	17.61790775229928	female	White	0.007685516029596329	na	na	na	1	selfharm

I have mine in one of those build a bear bags 🤷‍♂️ no one’s found them and they’ve been in there for years. Also small enough to take it somewhere and be able to hide it 👍	OceanSomething	reply	na	na	na	0.9918002486228943	no	strong	no	na	selfharm
