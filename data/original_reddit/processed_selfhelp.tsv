"Gaining self-respect is not something that happens overnight.

It takes time, energy, and effort, but it‚Äôs worth it.

When you respect yourself, you live in a place of abundance which helps you create healthy relationships with those around you.

Here are the four ways I used to gain self-respect:

**#1: Think of your past achievements, no matter how small they are.**

This way works for literally anyone.

Because all of us have done at least something small that we can be proud of.

Doesn‚Äôt have to be something grandiose.

Maybe it was holding the door for the elderly woman from our block.

Or helping a classmate with his homework back in the day.

Whatever it might be, you can use that situation to create a story for yourself.

A story about you and how no matter how bad your situation is, you‚Äôve done something that deserves your own respect.

**#2: Create and pursue personal goals.**

Achieving goals is one of the easiest ways to gain self-respect.

But most of us don‚Äôt hit them for two reasons:

\- We don‚Äôt set realistic goals.

\- We don‚Äôt do the work.

We don‚Äôt want that to be us going forward, so here‚Äôs how we can avoid this:

**- Separate your life into different buckets (health, wealth, relationships, business, hobbies.)**

For each bucket, create 1 target goal you think you can hit by the end of the year.

**- Write down the EXACT steps you need to take to hit that goal.**

Separate these steps into repeatable tasks that you must execute daily, weekly, and monthly to hit your goals.

**- Add negative consequences.**

What happens if you don‚Äôt hit your goals?

The answer must be better than ‚ÄúI just stay in the same place.‚Äù

One thing that has worked well for me is giving my brother money any time I cheat on my diet.

I hate giving my brother money, so having possible negative consequences for my actions pushes me in the right direction.

You can use the same principle for your goals.

Find someone or an organization you HATE giving money to and then make it so that if you don‚Äôt hit your goal, you‚Äôll have to give them some amount of $$$.

This type of accountability will help you move in the right direction.

**#3: Be consistent.**

People who are consistent in any pursuit are confident people.

Confident people have a strong degree of self-respect.

If you want to respect yourself, be consistent with your goals, actions, and thoughts.

**#4: Track your progress.**

One of my favorite quotes is by the billionaire investor Ray Dalio.

It goes like this ‚ÄúPain + reflection = progress.

‚ÄùThe more progress you make towards achieving your goals, the more self-respect you gain.

So make sure you track how well you‚Äôre doing in each area of your life.

Carefully assess, make adjustments, and don‚Äôt be afraid to reflect.

If you look far enough into the past, you‚Äôll realize how far you‚Äôve come.

"Glad seeing the importance of self-respect being pushed out there.

It‚Äôs fundamental to self-esteem and part of the trifecta of what I teach (health, environment, self-respect).

To add another layer to self-respect, leaving no stone unturned in regards to trauma will greatly bolster self respect as it takes away from the negativity that continually haunts us subconsciously."	Cultural-Ad788	reply	na	na	na	0.0014573008520528674	no	no	no	na	selfhelp

"To start off, I was obese my whole life pretty much. Ever since I was about 10, I was fat. That went on until I was 21 years old (last year). I graduated high school at 5‚Äô9ish. I had some pretty crazy growth spurts and am now 6‚Äô4. I also started talking my health seriously last year and started lifting. I went from 325lbs to now a pretty muscular 200lbs within the year. It‚Äôs SUPER weird and I get caught off guard with people compliment me. Especially when women ask for my number or give me a compliment (like call me handsome or cute). I feel like they are just joking or playing some dare game with their friends to mess with me. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of my insecurities from when I was fat or shorter. I still see the same fat ugly miserable guy in the mirror everytime. I‚Äôm insecure about my teeth still. I don‚Äôt really ever smile. I hate the fact that I have gaps (even though my teeth are perfectly straight). I‚Äôm the only one in my family with that.

"You're focusing on the details, whereas others focus on the entirety of you. You might see your teeth as a problem, but others probably barely notice them, and might actually find them cute. 

One thing about being 'attractive' as male is that your facial features matter less than [how you carry yourself](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1692053407471898971). If you're healthy and strong, you'll walk in a much more confident way than you did when you were overweight. And your personality & charisma will play a part in this too. 

Maybe it'll take time for it to really sink in, but it honestly sounds like the truth is you *are* attractive in the eyes of some people. Trust them and accept the compliment. 
It's rare that people would be cruel enough to play a dare asking for your number. So be brave, say yes, and start texting / calling - maybe ask them to hang out sometime.

I‚Äôd encourage you to either talk this through with a therapist or a trusted friend. Learn to value yourself and validate you at every stage. It will take a lot of intentional work! You may not overcome all the thoughts, but can help manage them better and improve your self esteem.

I feel like they are almost joking with me when I receive a compliment. And I‚Äôm SUPER insecure about my gaps.

Never did, my whole life they‚Äôve been telling me to laugh more and not be so moody, but my teeth are just ugly man. I have equality spaced gaps in between my top and bottom row teeth.

"So I've noticed that I'm feeling extremely anxious and nervous when someone accuses me of something that I did not do. I start sweating a lot and begin to stutter. Basically, I have the same reaction as if I was guilty of the thing that I'm accused of.  
It's also happening when someone is being inquisitive about something, like they seem to ask questions purposefully to fact check something I've said (or at least that's what my paranoia is suggesting me), and it makes me all uncomfortable and nervous.

"As child, did you experience high reactivity or volatility from parental/authority figures, especially in response to mistakes or perceived errors? This type of history can really linger.   
First of all, I want to commend you for having the self-awareness to recognize what's going on. Sounds like you've been observing this pattern for quite some time(years, as you say).   
Secondly, it sounds like you might benefit from therapy- perhaps Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. (CBT is a structured, time-limited, problem-focused and goal oriented form of psychotherapy. CBT helps people learn to identify, question and change how their thoughts, attitudes and beliefs relate to the emotional and behavioural reactions that cause them difficulty.)

If therapy is not an option, I recommend that you keep tracking your thought patterns- perhaps even write down instances when you find yourself experiencing this nervousness, and the variables that were present at the time.   
Think about what the ideal response looks like for you, so that you actually have something to strive towards.  
In moments when you are feeling said nervousness, or being accused for something you didn't do, take a second to slow yourself down. Take deeps breaths, and give yourself a mental hug. Maybe shake yourself out, or open and close your hands really quickly for 10 seconds. Remind yourself that you are a good person, and that regardless of wrong-doing, real or not, you deserve kindness and respect.   
Slowly, over time, your thought patterns and physiological response should begin to change. Have patience though, this can take months to years to really take effect.

I need to recover from stuff. I was thinking about posting to a community like this but everything I have found is really negative so if everyone could make a post like this called Spread Positivity then that would be cool. Let's ask ourselves the questions because nobody knows you like you and nobody knows me like me, and then we can answer them by doing constructive things that benefit us. It would be a really nice place to post my recovery.	0rdin4ry	post	7.914128205214281	male	White	0.007433021906763315	na	na	na	2	selfhelp

"I feel like I do not have any meaningful aspirations or interests of my own and I cannot even think just for myself. 

I work part-time (tutoring), study a foreign language, try to read more and listen to more unfamiliar music, but I'm quite convinced that I do none of this for myself and for self-development. It probably doesn't make sense on the surface, so I'll give examples. 

When I come to my foreign language classes, I only feel good when I do better than other students (not in a competitive way, moreso in an egocentric way). Learning languages is really easy for me so I usually do very well. However, when I actually have to study a new topic in the language course, I can barely get myself to do it. The only reason I do do it is seemingly just so others would think better of me.

When I work, I really like the process itself, as I get to teach people something new. I understand that liking your job is a good thing, but I am convinced that I only like it because it subconsciously feel smarter or better than whoever I am teaching. I don't even feel good when they thank me.

When I consume any kind of media (mostly literature or music, I don't really watch anything), I constantly think about myself discussing the piece of media in question with other people or telling others about it. When I read something new, I am unable to reflect on what I am reading unless I think about having to discuss it with others in the future. 

All in all, the desire to seem smart, knowledgeable and/or 'cool' to others seems to literally be the only thing that keeps me operating beyond basic functions. What makes it worse is that I don't even talk to people offline - I only have friends and acquaintances on the Internet, as I A) lived most of my life in a community where people had a drastically different mentality to mine and B) recently moved to another country which I do not speak the language of. 

I will be very thankful for any advice or insights."	Substantial-Basis478	post	24.111969964410797	female	White	0.9993526339530945	na	na	na	1	selfhelp

I am a 29 years old Indian woman. I met this academically highly accomplished guy. He is working for a reputed MNC. I met him through bumble. I have always been an average student. I have gap years also.I am appearing for judicial service examination in India. It has three stages. Stage one is preliminary where multiple Choice questions are asked. Second stage is mains exam where we have to write descriptive answers. Last stage is interview. I have appeared once for this exam and reached till mains stage. I got intimidated by this guys academic achievements that I lied that I reached interview stage. I have been to many dates but never lied to anyone of them.  I thought that I will tell him the truth later. But now we are in a serious relationship and want to get married. His company is going to send him to Europe by the end of this year. He talked to his company's lawyers about my employment opportunities and told them that I don't have gap years and I reached interview stage of judicial service examination. I didn't know that he was going to do that. If only I had the slightest of the idea , I would have told him everything. Now he got to know about all these things. He is saying I broke his trust and his credibility is on the line. I am a selfish person who never cared about him. But it is not true. If I knew he is going to something like this I would have told him. Now he broke up with me and not talking to me.

When you got good and healthy habits, your body is supposed to be and feel good, right? 

Well, in my case, no. 

A year after exercising (simple body weight exercises) 5x a week, I still ended up with varicose veins, a lower pain in my abdomen and an instance where my lower back hurt like an old dude among the many other problems that I felt. 

Less than six months after getting a consistent skincare routine and my face is filled with much more pimples than ever before and my neck is scarred. 

Brushing my teeth 3x a day and I still get aches a few times a year. 

Eating a more healthy and balanced diet yet there seems to be a problem with my digestive system. 

Now, there were other factors that contributed to those problems but it feels truly ironic and really saddening that while I try to keep having a healthy lifestyle, I'm faced with these problems while others, for example my siblings who do the opposite of what I do (being physically inactive, not having balanced meals or not having a skincare) still look and feel great. 

And the simple fact that I felt and was seemingly better before I started all these activities to really focus on having a healthy lifestyle makes me so sad. 

It's just so disappointing and ironic"	PJJPIAN	post	20.983876672123426	male	White	0.9994969367980957	na	na	na	1	selfhelp

"Hello everyone,

You know how challenging it can be to manage your time effectively with so many tasks to juggle, deadlines to meet, and distractions to overcome. That's where time blocking templates come in. They're like your secret weapon for staying organized and maximizing your efficiency.

I've been using these templates to allocate specific time blocks for different tasks in my day, week, or month. By doing so, I've prioritized my most important tasks and made room for leisure activities too.

Now, you might be wondering how to effectively use these templates for your daily routine. Let me walk you through the key steps:

1. Start by blocking off time for your most important tasks. These could be activities that require your focused attention, like work projects, personal goals, or exercise. Designate specific blocks for these tasks during periods when you're most alert and productive.

2. Next, allocate time for tasks that require more effort or energy. Think of activities like cleaning, organizing, or running errands. By scheduling these tasks, you'll ensure that they don't get neglected and that you feel accomplished throughout the day.

3. Don't forget to make room for activities that require less brainpower. We all need breaks and leisure time. Schedule blocks for activities like reading, watching your favorite show, going for a walk, or catching up with friends. These moments of relaxation are just as important for your overall well-being and productivity.

Remember, repetition is key! Repeat this process for each day or week, adjusting your schedule as needed. The goal is to create a routine that works best for you and helps you make consistent progress towards your goals.

To make the most out of your time blocking template, here are a few additional tips and tricks:

1. Start each day by listing your to-do's and priorities at the top of your schedule. This will help you stay focused and ensure that you allocate time for important tasks.

2. Color code your schedule to make it visually appealing and easy to navigate. Use different colors to categorize tasks or highlight specific deadlines. It'll make your plan more engaging and enjoyable to follow.

3. When it's time to focus on a task, do your best to eliminate distractions. Put your phone in ""focus mode,"" use website blockers, or find a quiet spot to minimize interruptions. Your undivided attention will make a significant difference in your productivity.

I know how challenging it can be to find the right routine, but trust me, time blocking templates can be a game-changer. They provide structure, accountability, and a clear roadmap to help you achieve your goals. Give them a try and see how they work for you!

If you've already tried time blocking templates before, feel free to share your experiences and tips in the comments below. I'd love to hear your insights!

Wishing you all the best in your pursuit of productivity and personal success!

"Long story short, this person (31F) who was a close friend of mine (27M) sent me romantic signals for a full year and then when we got together rejected me after 1 day. Later she crawled back to me and I entertained this person for a full three months and got rejected two more times (total is 3). After a while I see her statuses with some other dude. This hurt me, mentally,  emotionally and even had physical reactions to it (shaking, stomach ache, feeling hangover after dreaming of her). 
Now when I see blonde women, dresses, braces, hearing her name, going to places we went to makes me feel awful and reminds me of her. I hate it and pray to God to atleast not let me dream of her because I cant even sleep afterwards.

Already doing zero contact, blocked her, and only had her on whatsapp where I saw her profile with this guy and her wrapped around each other basically.

Sounds like she was using you for your attention. It‚Äôs a form of abuse. Learn to see that, the person doesn‚Äôt respect you and is a tease. It‚Äôs actually sadistic, it‚Äôs a power trip, and finally you feel betrayed. Not your fault. The lesson is: do not rely on promises and suggestions and flirting for anything.

Everyone needs someone to take care of them. It‚Äôs in our nature to expect this from our family. But sometimes we don‚Äôt see the patterns. I imagine my  child self standing in front of me. He‚Äôs scared and no one is paying attention to him. He thinks no one notices. But I see him now. And I know I can take care of him. We need to see the child version of ourselves and the ones in the people around us. You don‚Äôt have to take care of them all at once. Only the ones in your present moment.

I have a major problem that‚Äôs driving me insane. I talk to myself, CONSTANTLY. It doesn‚Äôt matter where or when, it‚Äôs as if part of my subconscious thinks I‚Äôm in a movie and need to say things to make it clear what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôll be at the store and say out loud ‚ÄúWow, they have that here!?!‚Äù and get awkward looks, and then I‚Äôll panic and just keep talking about it until I leave. The whole way home I‚Äôll talk to myself, then when I get home I‚Äôll talk about a game or a show. Even when I have a friend right next to me I‚Äôll be talking to myself and they‚Äôll get confused. I get mocked for it all the time by family and friends, and at my age (which I won‚Äôt say here) it‚Äôs nearly impossible to find friends mature enough to help me instead of laugh or just avoid me. And to clarify, by talking to myself, I mean I‚Äôll say my thoughts out loud, or even talk to inanimate objects (but like not schizophrenic or anything).

Have you tried journaling? Maybe getting your thoughts out on paper would help. There is a technique called morning pages where the first thing you do when you wake up is just write three pages of whatever comes to mind. It wouldn‚Äôt be easy at first, but setting aside a specific time (or times) in your day to empty your subconscious out maybe could help you stop it happening all day.

"I know I struggled with this a lot when I was younger. I'm from a big family, and I found that I did this a lot because I really wanted to grab someone's attention. If you find that's you too, don't worry too much; it's not bad to want attention. Once I realized I did this subconsciously for attention, it brought it to the front of my brain, that I can just ASK for attention instead. ""Hey! Did you see that they carry this here? Wow!"" Or even just the extra, dramatic measure of saying ""Pay attention, I have something to show you.""

I hold such compassion for you because I do something similar. I usually talk to myself when I'm alone, but when I was younger, my younger brother used to kid me about times that I'd say something and crack myself up. He thought it was strange, but I always accepted this part of myself because it feels natural to me. Now that I'm grown, I notice that it comes in different styles among people. You can recognize it in the person who loves to talk. The only difference is they have an audience! In general, I see people in two different categories. One- is the fountain, where things are allowed to flow.And two-are people who put in an effort to restrict the flow. It can be an easy thing to understand, no need to complicate it.

"You are okay. You are not unusual. This is just how you process information‚Ä¶there are lots of people like this. Verbalizing is how you process and organize ideas. You like to talk things out.

"I grew up with people all around me, so when I have personal issues, instead of facing them myself, I go to someone to solve it for me. That's my own issue, but I have always felt part of a team.
My boyfriend is the opposite. 

He is from a divorced family, had issues with a babysitter one time when he was young, and never heard the words ""I love you"" from his parents as a kid. In fact, as soon as he was old enough, he left home. His dream is to have a big family, (like mine) and finally feel apart of one like he never did. The only problem is that he's constantly stressed and anxious by daily life. He fantasizes about running away and living alone all of the time and always feels disconnected from everyone, (derealization?). He's never felt like he belongs in his own life. He's told me he's been to at least 3 therapists, but they don't seem to help him at all. I'm not sure if he's stuck around long enough to be sure though, or felt like he clicked with any of them...

For me, this is scary to hear, because I have never been with anyone who feels so opposite of me, and it hurts me to not be able to help him.

"Sorry for the long post in advance

I 22M just graduated college and am moving about 10 hours away soon to help further my career. Things have been ok until recently I had a lot of realizations hit me all at once and its left me totally overwhelmed and in a very doomer mindset. 

On a large scale it seems like the whole world is screwed. Climate change is worsening to a point of no return, and while people are doing amazing work to help the situation it seems hopeless with greedy corporate overlords who only care about adding more money to their absurd amount of wealth at the helm of making important decisions for real change. The US housing crisis is only getting worse making it seem like most of my generation will never be able to own a home, and the only alternative is renting from landlords (whom I wholeheartedly believe are the scum of the earth but thats a rant worthy of its own entire post). Life in general seems to be getting more and more expensive soon getting to a point where basic human needs such as food healthcare will become a luxury. Unfortunately I picked a career that does not pay very well but thats on me. Politicians across the world seem to be corrupt and selfish, and they are the ones controlling the world. Making decisions that impact every one of us under the facade of wanting to make the world a better place but really just having the ultimate goal of making the most profit. Yes these are largely ‚Äúfirst world problems‚Äù but I think they are still valid concerns to have and I do understand that just by living in the US I have many more opportunities and luxuries afforded to me than people living in poorer countries. 

On top of the anxiety of continuing to live in a world likely destined for failure in the relative near future, I feel incredibly isolated and like Im on a path to nowhere. I am an artist and while I think Im pretty good and make enough money to pay the bills from my art (very fortunate and grateful for that), I cant escape the torment of realizing that this whole thing probably wont work out. I spend hours every day on my craft, all because I am selfish enough to think that one day it will be good enough for other people to spend their time enjoying it. I have contemplated other career paths but honestly I love what I do so much I don‚Äôt think I can do anything else and still have any will to live left. This is really my main reason for getting up in the morning. 

I have tried to start talking about these problems to my friends, but every time I just seem to push them away. I make sure to ask if I can vent to them and they agree to listen. Its just making me realize ultimately in this world everyone cares about only themselves, and I have a hard time accepting that. I need to figure out a way to not wake up and be miserable, because no matter what I do it all seems hopeless that the worlds just going to keep getting worse and Im going to keep pushing people away. I also have a crippling fear of ending up alone in life and I think if I ever reach a point in life with no friends or romantic partner I would probably just end it all. I dont show it but I deeply envy the friends I have who seem to have it all figured out. Not necessarily career wise as we are all struggling in that sense but in social circles. Many never have problems with anyone and if they do they always settle it well and maintain their relationships, still voice their opinions on things, and generally seem unbothered by many things. I have a friend who is scared of dying not because of death itself but because he enjoys living too much, and he is my age in my same situation. I want to know how I can also enjoy living so much that Im scared of dying. Im not suicidal, I just wish I was never born because I feel like I cant handle the stress of the world.

I (20m) am doing nothing with my life. I feel like a neet, just straight up nothing all day besides basic human tasks and time wasters. I finally got sick of living like this and decided I want to pursue college and find a real job not some part-time thing that goes nowhere. But then I realized my terrible gpa in highschool finally caught up to me. Idk how I can get into even a community college with a gpa under 1.0, I got a 1430 or something like that on my SATs so maybe that‚Äôll help? I don‚Äôt know anymore. I tried self-learning on and off for a year and a half its not really going anywhere, I think I need the structure, support, and connections of college to get somewhere in life. Who do I even talk to if I want to figure my life out (besides parents/family they sort of led to my academic demise) a psychiatrist? A motivational speaker? My school counselor from almost 3 years ago? A job recruitment agency? I feel so lost.	ForwardMinimum8774	post	9.886753127811119	male	White	0.9990074038505554	na	na	na	13	selfhelp
"You're not going to have a hard time getting into community College.  My friend failed out of high school, got straight As in community College, transfered to penn state, went to law school in california and is currently a successful lawyer who practices in both California and Pennsylvania.  You're 20.  You have a lot of time to figure out what you want to do.  

If I were you, I'd get in line for trade unions immediately while you figure out what you truly what to do.  Sometimes it takes years to get in, but once you do, you're set.  My cousins are union carpenters in NYC who make around 100k a year, have great medical benefits, tons of vacation pay, and will have a great pension when they retire.  Their father, my uncle, gets $7k a month to sit on his ass and drink beer and fish all day.  And if you go that route, you'll be making more than many of your peers in no time, and not have to deal with crippling debt (community College won't leave you with that, but if you transfer to a university, you will.  Most likely).

Where do you live?  What industries are booming there (if any)?  What do you enjoy doing?  Building things? Selling things? Art work? Sitting on a computer? Would you want to travel?  Hate your area? Do you want to work with your hands? Computers? Do you want to help people? Do you just want to find a lucrative job? Do you want a typical 9-5 40 hour a week job?  Do you want to throw the dice on a commission-based job where you could potentially make a lot of money for working harder/smarter?  There's probably hundreds of questions that could be posed to help you figure out what route you should go.  Pick something, and try to stay in the same vein so that your work history builds upon itself.  And stay busy.  Employeers don't like seeing large gaps in work history.  If you stay working, they have reason to believe you'll be a good employee despite your background.

Want some quick cash and attempt to do things on your own? Angi has been great for side jobs for me, in my region.  I can pretty easily make a few hundred dollars a day just mowing lawns (angi takes a huge cut, so you need to tell your clients that and get paid in cash) and it almost always leads to more lucrative jobs.  Anyone can paint, and painters can make a good amount of money and you don't need to have a lot of equipment to get going.  And it's another job that is pretty easy to do yourself.  Many blue collar jobs require you to have assistance.  Lots of other jobs go along with that kind of work.  Like hanging drywall and finishing.  Trim work.  Flooring.  All easy stuff to learn, but probably a good idea to work under someone before you start going on your own.  Obviously mowing lawns won't require you to have previous experience.  Grab a mower, weed Wacker and a backpack blower and you're in business.  Can throw a push mower right in the back of your car, don't even need a trailer.  Aim for smaller jobs.  Another job I did when I was younger that paid relatively well was cable installation.  Not hard to make a grand a week, people are always hiring, you usually get a company truck so you sometimes won't have to pay for gas to commute to work, my region tips well so I usually ended up with between $40-100 just in tips per day and it's not very physically demanding.  And you work by yourself so you don't have to deal with bullshit from other employees.  Most customers are easy, and if they're not, so what, you'll probably never see them again.

I got tired of being paid dirt and watching my bosses rake in money, so just sharing what ive been dabbling with. There's a lot of flexible pickup ""gig economy"" jobs out there depending on where you live.  If you get used to that kind of thing, it's possible to move or visit other places and just do the same jobs there.

But you're young.  At least start on the community College and trade union route if you can't decide in another route.  If there are any barriers, knock them down IMMEDIATELY AND RELENTLESSSLY. I went to a good university, but bad habits with alcohol, weed, video games, and severe anxiety and depression cut that short before my senior year.  It took me a long time to find the right medication, but I finally did and it was life changing.  Point being, that even as a nearly 40 year old, it's still possible to change things up and explore different routes.  

Try different things.  Fail. Over and over.  You'll succeed eventually.

">Who do I even talk to if I want to figure my life out

First, read through *every single link* here:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/kaidomac/comments/qqzjc2/job\_resource\_guides/](https://www.reddit.com/r/kaidomac/comments/qqzjc2/job_resource_guides/)

Here's the thing:

* **No one is coming to rescue you**

This is a bit scary-sounding at first, but it all boils down to how happiness & success *really* work.  Regarding happiness:

1. No one can come into our lives to define happiness for us
2. Even if they did, we'd simply reject it because it wasn't OUR idea
3. Likewise, no one can put in the daily effort into achieving & maintaining happiness for us

It's like getting in-shape: if we want 6-pack abs, no one else can do the pushups for us!  We have to decide what we want, work to achieve it, and then work to maintain it.  In practice, that means learning how to be successful.  Success has two parts:

1. Success is specific
2. Success is personal

Life is kind of a kaleidoscope of different situations, but really, success is specific to each active situation we're dealing with in our lives.  We can be superstar workaholics, but also be absent parents (re: the Cat's in the Cradle song), which means that success is compartmentalized & is specific to each individual situation.

In addition, success is personally-defined within each specific situation.  For example, not everyone wants to live in a mansion; some people want to live in an RV!  So it's up to us to decide what WE define as success in our lives!  So the idea that ""no one is coming to rescue us"" really just means this:

* **We have to rescue ourselves!**

This is a HUGE & fantastic opportunity for us, because it means that WE get to define what happiness & success means to us!  This isn't something that is really taught to us growing up!  We just kind of grow up passively taking life as it comes, until one day, we hit the situation that you've found yourself in & kind of ""wake up"" to the reality of our situation!  This is a good starting point:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/hsp/comments/y2jy7p/comment/is4blri/?context=3

In a nutshell, we get to choose our level of happiness in life, regardless of our present circumstances.  Right now, you've had some setbacks & are wondering about the future.  The reality is that life is what we make of it, so until we bother to do a few simple exercises like creating a life plan & a 5-year plan & getting into motion every day, nothing much is going to happen because no one else gets to dictate what happiness means to us or impose their definition of success in each situation we deal with in life!

So don't think of it so much as needing instant or overnight results, as much as starting to flesh out a blueprint or a template of who you want to be & how you want to live your life!  For me, the starting point is to define your timeline:

* Assume you're going to live to 100 years old
* You're 20 now
* **That means you have 80 years left!!**

You already have a basic idea of what you do & DON'T want:

* ""I (20m) am doing nothing with my life. I feel like a neet""
* ""just straight up nothing all day besides basic human tasks and time wasters""
* ""I finally got sick of living like this and decided I want to pursue college and find a real job not some part-time thing that goes nowhere""
* ""I tried self-learning on and off for a year and a half its not really going anywhere, I think I need the structure, support, and connections of college to get somewhere in life.""
* ""I want to figure my life out""

So here's what I'm hearing:

1. You are ready to take full ownership of your life, your happiness, and your success, but you don't know what the next step is
2. You know you don't want to just waste time all day or work at a part-time job that doesn't go anywhere
3. You recognize that you need structure in order to be successful

Here are some things to think about:

* Your present circumstances are not set in stone.  Your history is not a life sentence or a verdict about your future.  It's simply the road that you were required to travel to get you to the point where you ""woke up"" to the reality of your life & to realizing that you want more from life!  This is an important point for EVERYONE to hit in life because this is where the REAL fun begins!!
* In America, there are more than 12,000 unique types of jobs available & the job market currently has more than 9 million job openings available.  There is endless training available for any type of job you could want & salary information is readily available on sites like Indeed & Glassdoor.  You can get trained for anything you're capable of doing!
* You're at an important juncture in your life: you've hit the point where you're ready & willing to take full, personal responsibility over your life & your future happiness.  This may seem a big scary & disheartening now, but all it means is that you can design & chase after as AMAZING of a life as you want to create!

As for me:

* I graduated high school with a 1.9 GPA, which is a far cry from a 4.0 GPA!
* It took me like 14 years to finish my 2-year degree
* I didn't get diagnosed with Inattentive ADHD until halfway through college, which explained so much of the invisible barriers I was dealing with & the difficulties I encountered related to scholastic performance!

Today, I have a great job, I've learned how to learn, and I actually ENJOY learning!  I've learned how to do everything from baking to 3D printing over the years.  I still spin my wheels when left to my own devices, but I've also learned some better coping strategies to help get me back up when I fall off the wagon!

"Yes, that's the right direction. 100%. Keep thinking through what's happening. You force an experience through your perception and then THAT is what the experience is. Your perception is image + language. You apply the language with your thoughts, but more potently with the things you say. So if you say ""I'm getting frustrated"" you are literally going to make that your experience. The other half of that trick is what you allow yourself to visualize.

"Firstly, you've opened up about the issues bothering you and want to make a change for the better --- that's the first major step to great positive change. And I congratulate you for that. 

And, everyone has the power to change.

You mentioned dieting. I would like to suggest drinking celery juice each morning, on an empty stomach, (at least 15min before breakfast). Pure celery juice, not with any water or anything mixed with it.  (It's great for many things such as: clearer skin, improved digestion, less bloating, sustained energy, better mental clarity, weight loss, and stable moods, the list goes on...).

You'll need a juicer, and it's worth it to get one IMO. Aside from celery juice, you can make other apple-carrot juice, etc. 

Some helpful information on celery juice here (and its amazing benefits): [https://www.medicalmedium.com/medical-medium-celery-juice-movement.htm](https://www.medicalmedium.com/medical-medium-celery-juice-movement.htm)

Like someone else said in the comments, cutting down on sugars is advisable. (This will also help with your state of mind too). Refined sugars, high fructose corn syrup, that kind of stuff, and oily processed foods, you'll want to avoid. The fruit in sugar, however, is good for you and the human brain needs it. 

You can learn some basic Chinese cooking. (Just a suggestion). It's quite easy. Rice goes with almost anything. And you can use a lot of basic ingredients. I'm a westerner, but I've mainly been eating Chinese/Asian style cooking for the past 20+ years, and I feel much better. It doesn't leave me feeling bloated, and provides good nutrition.

You'll find lots of nice simple to prepare Chinese recipes here. (There's a lot of great channels in fact): [https://www.youtube.com/@CiCiLi/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@CiCiLi/videos)

&#x200B;

You also mentioned you want to help yourself mentally---that's the most important I'd say. 

Take a look at this video, you'll see exactly how positive and negative thoughts impact the molecules in our bodies. How your words affect others. It'll be good inspiration for positive thinking: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcTsX4NOt7Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcTsX4NOt7Y)

&#x200B;

Start simple, don't overwhelm yourself at first.

Start with a simple habit (or two), each day. You will have a sense of achievement if you set out to embark on a simple goal, and go at it a little each day, and complete a week of that // and then a month of that, and so on. (You can keep upping your goals too). 

Have a simple routine that you require of yourself each morning.

I'd strongly suggest, if you aren't already, wake up at an earlier hour, and dedicating the first hour of the day to your own self improvement. There are a plethora of things you may engage in. Push ups. A power walk around the block. Celery juice on an empty stomach ;). Meditation. Learn a language.

Hope that helps. I wish you well."	Half_A_BrainCell69	reply	na	na	na	0.9961084723472595	weak	no	no	na	selfhelp

"This.  I lost 30 lbs in a month on two different occasions.  It is very difficult to stick to, but it's honestly amazing how well it works.  Your appetite will be a fraction of what it was.  You'll feel better (after initially feeling like complete crap).  Weight will just melt off.  You don't even need to work out, but if you do, you'll be able to see results daily.

You're going to have to do some research to fully.commit to this.  Like the above poster said, bacon and eggs is like a staple of keto.  But you can only do that so much.  I ate a lot of high fat ground beef, smothered with cheese.  More or less bun less burgers.  Watch the trace carbs. They'll fuck you.  Things like ketchup, many condiments many vegetables (though some are ok in moderation).  Drinks were always the most difficult for me.  Even though many drinks will say no carbs, lots of the artifical sweeteners will still raise your blood sugar and are bad for you.  Liquid Stevia takes a little bit to adjust to, but allows you to have a normalish sweet drink.  There is a soda called Zevia that was a little expensive, bit uses Stevie as a sweetener.  I think the new Gatorade... square ish looking containers may have used Stevie?  Drinking alcohol is very tricky.  Avoid processed meats.  They usually have trace carbs that you wouldn't expect, plus it's not good to focus your diet on processed shit (you'll want to out of convenience).  Eating out at restaurants it's very hard.  Get used to salads with light dressing with chicken or preparing your own food.  Hot wings are pretty good on keto, and I believe blue cheese dip is low or zero carbs.  Bun-less burgers on the go.  Nuts are a great snack, but certain ones have more carbs than you'd think.  Get keto test strips from cvs or where ever.  Takes the guess work out of if you're truly in ketosis.  When you're dying for carbs, I used the mission carb balance tortillas.  They take getting used to, but will hit the spot and are worth the few carbs.  You need to be careful with this ine, but many super markets have rotisserie chicken.  Some have a lot of carbs, some don't.  Some berries are relatively low in carbs and whipped cream has zero carbs, I believe.  Whipped cream, berries and peanuts was a favorite desert/snack of mine.  It's a good idea to cook whole chicken, turkey, and roasts, cut up and freeze the meats in individual bags for convenience (since, again, it's hard to eat anywhere and trust there aren't hidden carbs).

Sorry if it's unorganized.  Just doing a little brain dump.  Think im going to get back on keto too.  Thanks for the kick in the ass!"	Half_A_BrainCell69	reply	na	na	na	0.9961084723472595	weak	strong	no	na	selfhelp
"The Spiritual Integration Technique (S.I.T) :

Here is a powerful exercise I discovered to help heal problems in your life in a miraculouslly potent way. 

First, identify an emotionnal/mental/spiritual disfunction within you you would like to heal/get relief from. As an example, lets say I want to heal the part of me who feels hate toward stuff.

Then, the exercise unfolds in 3 steps:

Step 1 :

The first step is to give a voice to your afflicted self. Intend to FEEL the problematic energy, get in contact with the disfunction you cant seem to get away from. Then, vent out about your problem (internally and to your own self) FROM THE PERSPECTIVE of your disfunctionnal self. Pretend you are it for a while, and vent from ITS perspective. Say whats on your mind, give details of what botters you, just let it all out, speak about the pressure of what you are going through (the things you never counsciouslly let out or acknowledged before), in any way that feels natural and organic to you, for as long as you feel is needed. Just like you would do with a trusted psychologist. Not only are you the patient in your own mind, but you are also the therapist who can ask pertinent questions to encourage your wounded self to open up and feel safe, such as : ``Why does this botter you?, or Why does it makes you feel this way?``. When you ask youself questions from the inner perspective of a therapist, try to be as neutral and without agenda as you can to promote openness and honesty. Neutrallity is key. Instead of beeing pushy, pretend you just want to gatter informations in the most neutral way possible, with no agenda.

Step 2 :

Once you`ve laid out your the problem into your counscious awareness and investigated it from the perspective of an inner therapist, now is time for the second step. This step is about choosing a ``mantra/affirmation/counscious thought`` of the opposite experience. (If I struggle with hate, the opposite experience would be love and patience, so I could choose ``I am caring and patient`` as a personnalized mantra/affirmation). Pick a sentence, a mantra, that intuitivelly FEELS right. Once you chose your mantra, repeat it in your mind for a little while. Get to feel the energy of what your mantra implies, chew on it, absorb it with gratitude and appreciation, contemplate your affirmation/mantra, in the most relaxed and flexible way possible. The more you appreciate this new space within you, the more of it you integrate. Dont stress out on how to keep it, oppenning your heart to this new energy (through gratitude and appreciation and joyfull releif) is the highest way of integrating what you wish to ``keep``. The more relaxed and casual you are (throughout the entire exercise), the more potent the results.

Step 3 :

Instead of running away with your self generated positive energy, we now GO BACK to the problem we want to evolve and heal. Go back to feeling the energy of the disfucntion within you from step 1. First, just stay silent and sit with it for about 10 seconds. After your 10 second is done, ask your ``disfunctional self`` what it thinks about the positive affirmation, (if it can relate with it, if it feels more at peace, etc), and answer your questions, from the perspective of your disfunction. Again, remain as relaxed and receptive as possible, there is no better answer, the best answer is the most honnest and the more accruate of whats really going on within you at this precise moment in time. You will most likelly feel your ``disfunctionnal self`` is doing a whole lot better, and it may or may not still relate to the way it was feeling in step one. If there still a part of you who can still relate to the original disfunction, just go back to step one and do another round this exerciese. 

It will not only provide instant and profound relief, but you will aslo be flabbergasted at your inhabillity to fall back into the same mindset as you were minutes ago. The same toughts and event will happen, but you will see stuff from a way deeper and grounded perspective. It just takes a few minutes, and I cant insist enough on how powerfull this exercise it, so I will let your personnal results speak for themselves, if you wish to try this."	scrotosorus	post	32.817638942890525	female	White	0.0016169191803783178	na	na	na	2	selfhelp

"**TLDR**: With a background in psychology and computer science, I developed **PsyScribe**‚Äîan AI therapist powered by ChatGPT for improving your mental health. The intention is to provide a first step towards therapy for people who have non-clinical symptoms and experience barriers to see a human therapist. My AI therapist is highly customizable to your needs and addresses many challenges with using ChatGPT for therapy like having to design prompts and making sure ChatGPT stays in its role. It also enhances ChatGPT with long-term memory and  generation of conversation insights, both of which are essential for successful therapy. The AI therapist was developed in the context of my master thesis in which it was able to improve the mental health of the participants. You can try it out for free at [https://www.psyscribe.com](https://www.psyscribe.com).

Hello everyone,

With a master's degree in computer science and a bachelor's degree in psychology, the idea of merging AI with psychotherapy intrigued me. So for my master thesis I decided to investigate the effect of personalizing a ChatGPT based AI therapist on the therapeutic bond with the AI therapist. The results showed that personalisation was linked with a significantly higher therapeutic bond with the AI therapist after using it for 2 weeks. The therapeutic bond was also similar to those with a  human therapist. This is important because the therapeutic bond is robustly linked to therapeutic success. Another result was that 49/54 participants indicated that the chatbot helped them with their mental health. After these promising results I decided to further develop this it into a product, PsyScribe. (For those who are interested here is a draft of this research paper which my promoter says will likely be published [https://storage.googleapis.com/psyscribe\_paper/paper\_psyscribe.pdf](https://storage.googleapis.com/psyscribe_paper/paper_psyscribe.pdf))

**Why I believe my PsyScribe AI therapist is superior to vanilla ChatGPT for therapy:**

1.**Fully personalizable and optimized for therapy:**

PsyScribe is easily customizable to make your feel comfortable and make the AI therapist meet your specific needs. It also removes the struggle of having to design your own prompts and making sure ChatGPT stays in his role as therapist. The following aspects are personalizable:

* Therapy style: you can choose between a solution-oriented or supportive-listening therapy style.
* Personality: you can choose between a motivational, professional or cheerful therapist personality.
* Avatar: you can create your own therapist avatar, making sure you feel comfortable with who you are talking to.
* Giving a name to your AI therapist and letting the AI therapist know and remember your name.
* Choosing the typespeed of the AI therapist.

**2. Long and short-term therapist memory:**

Vanilla ChatGPT often forgets important therapeutic information and can‚Äôt remember information across different chats. But in therapy you don‚Äôt want to re-explain yourself in every new conversation and want to make sure your therapist remembers important information. That‚Äôs why a PsyScribe AI therapist has two forms of memory.

* Short-term memory: The AI therapist has a short-term memory by continuously summarising and analysing the current conversation, making sure that no important information is lost. This short-term memory is always available to the therapist but also limited in size and conversation (chat) specific.
* Long-term memory: To overcome the limitations of the short-term memory, you can also manually store messages in the long-term memory which is large in size and available to the AI therapist across all conversations (chats). Every time you send a  message the therapist will look for relevant info in his/her long-term memory and will use this retrieved information in his/her answer.

**3. Automatic Conversation insights**

An important aspect of psychotherapy reflecting on insights from past conversations and planning future actions. PsyScribe also makes this aspect easier by having the AI therapist automatically summarize your conversations and keep track of important feelings, thoughts, goals and other possibly useful insights.  You can edit these insights and indicate how important you think they are. After you rated your insights on importance, they are compiled in a report for reflection, or can be shared with your psychologist / coach.

**Safety and data security:**

All your conversation data is safely and  securely stored, making sure no third-party has access to your data.  You can always request to delete all the data associated with your account.

An important warning is that ofcourse all the answers of the AI therapist are computer generated and could potentially be inappropriate. For serious mental health problems we recommend you to seek out professional help instead of using PsyScribe.

**Conclusion**:

In short I believe using my PsyScribe AI therapist has important benefits over using vanilla ChatGPT. My research has indicated that it AI psychotherapy is a promising approach to improving your mental health. You can try out psyscribe for free on:

"This sparked my interest. Congratulations on your bachelor and master, bachelor in healthcare informatics here. Take this interaction as a huge complement on your work, I usually keep to myself.

My conversation so far:

Hi C, I am Mr. T your personal AI therapist. How is going today?

Explain to me how this system processes any information I put in. As detailed as possible. Be precise. Thank you

This system uses algorithms to analyze and interpret the information you provide. It breaks down the input into smaller components, identifies patterns and relationships, and applies predefined rules to generate a response.

How is the input I put in stored in the system? Who has access? If one doesn't trust your creator, how is one supposed to benefit from this?

The input you provide is stored in secure databases. Access to this information is limited to authorized individuals and is subject to privacy laws and regulations. If you don't trust the creator, it's important to familiarize yourself with the system's privacy policy and ensure your data is protected.

The privacy policy is very short and vague. I would like to be able to ensure my data is protected, yes.

It's understandable that you would like more clarity and assurance regarding the protection of your data. I recommend reaching out to the system's support team or the creator directly to discuss your concerns and seek further information about the security measures in place.

My random thoughts:
- ""Trust me. Take my word for it."" might not work for everyone. At least it does not make me comfortable enough to share what I would share during a 'analog' therapy session with my therapist.
- video conference software my therapist used during covid was encrypted and externally audited.
- cves also exist because people are only human and people had access to a system's architecture.
- open access to your code? What part is your thesis, what is business?
- for a secure system where my data stays with me I'd pay up to 200‚Ç¨ per month 
- would it be possible to only verify issued license key online against database and healthcare related private information/ data stays with me?

"Hi thanks for the positive response,  


The AI therapist itself actually does not know anything about the privacy policy as  I have never given him access to that so he is just making that up in your conversation.   


My privacy policy is actually the following:  
All data you send is encrypted over https and stored in my encrypted and secure firestore database hosted by google. Everytime you send a message I also need to make an API call to chatGPT to make the therapist answer but this is also very secure and your data isn't used for training models. If you for whatever reason decide that you want me to delete all the data associated with your account such as all your settings,  stored messages etc.  Your data is never shared with  third parties or looked access by me. If you delete a conversation also all your messages are deleted so you can basically clean up your data yourself. You can always  send me an email and I will delete everything like stored therapist settings, email etc. In short I really do believe I have created a safe system.  


Other answers to your thoughts:  
1. The privacy  policy can't be explained by the AI therapist itself. If you have anymore questions after reading the above don't hesitate to message me.  
2. This is also  encrypted as all  data is send over https.  
3. ""would it be possible to only verify issued license key online against database and healthcare related private information/ data stays with me? ""  I don't know what this means but your private information is securely stored and can't be accessed by  third parties not will it be shared with  anyone.

Using the notes app. (On iphone, but you can  use whatever is similiar). It's sorta like my guide, I have 7 days of the week on it. On each day I work on something actually in my life, physically, mentally, spiritually. Even if it's 10 minutes for one of them, it's only 10 minutes of my day. Every morning I check it to start my day, every night I check what I did. After a while, you can add monthly or yearly goals. Add reflections and things you should do as well, it ends up being like a little pocket book.

I just stabbed myself with pens multiple times. I promised my parents I will never do this again. And this is not the first time I have done this after I made the promise. 
I am in a relationship with a wonderful guy but somedays I just get so snappy and irritated that I push him away. He always asks me to share but I just cannot tell him that I am having another episode where I want to rip my head off. 

I don't know why is he even dating me. I just hate myself, i am overweight and don't do shit. As of now i told him(mybf) I have nothing to talk about and he bid me goodbye. I know i am wrong on so many levels. So as a punishment I did it.

Trust your boyfriend and most importantly trust yourself. You wrote this, so you know something is wrong. You recognize it which is always the first step.

"I‚Äôm going through a separation right now so I am doing a reinvention much like yourself. 

First thing I did was rearrange the home, get things that are mine and not hers, get rid of her personality off the walls and replace it with my own. 

Second, start eating better and working out because why not. Needs done anyway. Clean out the home, clean out yourself sort of thing. 

Third, I‚Äôm reading more, a lot more. Enjoying the present moments. I‚Äôm making some tea or coffee, discovering new music, enjoying the silence. Meditation in the micro moments between things. 

Fourth, this is probably the most practical for you. Get a ‚Äúthing‚Äù or many ‚Äúthings‚Äù. I‚Äôm taking up hobbies I‚Äôve never done. I started hiking, taking pictures of plants and bugs and researching them later with the end goal of knowing the forest with the same familiarity as I know the shopping mall. Also, I‚Äôm memorizing poems, learning to analyze them, and writing my own. Then I‚Äôll go to writing workshops so I can meet others. 

Your thing could be anything: woodworking, auto restoration, take flying lessons, learn a musical instrument, raise chickens, photography, knife throwing. I plan on taking up archery and horseback riding too. Maybe even learn to alter my own clothing instead of going to a tailor all the time.

I have a notebook of a couple dozen interests/skills that I‚Äôve always wanted to learn or get into and I‚Äôm slowly going through it. I probably won‚Äôt like everything, but in exploring genuinely I‚Äôll likely encounter others with similar interests and who knows what will come from that.

"Whenever you feel fear or the strong opposing force that many of us face when we have to do something that we don't want i.e. our jobs, house chores, etc.

We all know that it can be really hard to pull us out of that state and do the thing we're supposed to when we're feeling those feelings. You'll hear many people tell you to just use your willpower and muscle through it. Although willpower helps, it can only help in the short term, willpower will eventually run out. So accept that you will never beat your mind, that's the first thing you have to do. So how do we solve this?

The key is to just do the thing before the feeling of fear or being unmotivated sets in. Just do the thing you're supposed to do before it kicks in. Don't think, just DO.

You are never going to beat your mind when it feels those feelings for two simple reasons.

One, your mind is conditioned to always avoid pain (in this case, it's fear). The human instinct to avoid pain is much stronger than to chase pleasure, and that is a fact.

Two, your mind will always want to stay in the comfort zone (which ties back to the first reason stated above). Your mind will never want to push itself unless it's for a survival reason which in the modern world, has none of the problems many humans had in the past thus many humans today have remained productionless and in many cases, lack of fulfillment which have led many to severe mental health issues even suicide.

&#x200B;

So the answer to the problem, is to just do it as soon as possible before the feeling kicks in. Don't think, JUST DO. Please note that this is easier said than done, it takes a lot of practice to make this a habit which will make your life much easier.

"Can you give details on what that looks like in your life?

Sounds very interesting. I have a really bad time using my willpower so maybe this could help me. See when the unmotivated feeling is about to arise and use that as a cue to get up and do it before it has the chance to manifest. 

I have ADHD and noticed I need some time pressure or feeling of urgency to get into action.

"  


I am a slow reader and currently use Anki as a memory training/knowledge management software to retain all the essential information in my mind. It's a very effective technique since I have been able to recall and apply concepts in real life almost spontaneously. I like to think of it as 'borrowed knowledge' - some expert spent a decade+ to figure out something and I spent 2 hrs learning it and trained my mind to apply it whenever I need it for the rest of my life. This is how I become wiser faster.  


But the problem with this system is that it is slow. Reading in itself is slow (in the digital age) but at the same time, it helps you to get into the depths of very complex knowledge nuggets. And then there is the memory training part which can be quite exhausting and repetitive but at the same time, it is super effective when you have to apply things on the spot in real life real time.  


Any suggestions on how I can make this whole process faster and just 'borrow' as much knowledge as possible? Do you guys use any similar techniques? Mind sharing them? I would love to hear about it. "	Valaxx73	post	33.5302633771523	male	White	0.0033083322923630476	na	na	na	1	selfhelp

There‚Äôs a couple pretty twisted responses to this. At some point, we all do something that we aren‚Äôt proud of, something we know wasn‚Äôt good. It sounds like you can see that you made a mistake and don‚Äôt have plans to do that again. That‚Äôs a good thing, you‚Äôre learning from your mistake. What is hurting yourself physically and shaming yourself going to accomplish? I‚Äôm sure you feel embarrassed, guilty, ashamed, sad, and hurt. That totally makes sense, and I‚Äôd be more shocked if you didn‚Äôt. If you feel this way, it‚Äôs because you know you made a mistake and hurt someone you care about. The more you beat yourself up, the more you will drill in the sense that you are not good enough or you‚Äôre bad. This‚Äôll screw your self confidence and you‚Äôll abandon yourself. It will be okay! It‚Äôs just a mistake. You‚Äôre friend has the boundary on this one with whether or not he wants to be around you but just be honest about why you did it and apologize; we don‚Äôt do things for no reason. It sounds like he‚Äôs forgiven you, now I think it‚Äôs time to forgive yourself and move past this. Of course seek professional help if you need help navigating this, particularly if you have habits of self harm or lashing out.

If he pressed charges on you, you could go to jail. Women get away with so much, until they dont.

Sometimes we want to hurt someone because we are jealous, it could be a state of self worth. The self has so little that it gets attached to someone who seems to have so much or someone to accompany the lonely self.
But the question is, what is the self? What is it? Why do we defend it so much? What is truly important about the self?

With the Twitter and Reddit debacle I've really gotten into Blogging in an effort to liven up what some call [The Early Internet](https://jdsalaro.com/reflection/grieving-the-early-internet/). I'm loving Blogging, I don't know why I waited so long to start doing it again. The only  I don't have is time but unfinished drafts abound :]

Seeing as I've profited greatly from other's advice I thought it'd be a fun thing to ask people on here about what they'd like to know from a, in the eyes of others, somewhat successful, 30-something, philosophy nerd, tech-bro, relatively fit, wannabe homesteader, inquisitive blogger who knows a thing or two about growth, falling down, getting up and self-development. I've realized I often also write what's basically my own parachute for dire times, puting thoughts to paper that become useful to me personally months or years later.

Current drafts are ""Corporate Politics for Ethical Dummies"", ""How to Judge People"", ""On Kindness as antidote to Depression"", ""Avoid Individuals with a Scarcity Mindset"", ""Pacifism and Harmlessness are not the same"", etc.

So, in case any relatively lost 20-somethings ( basically me awhile ago :D ) come across this,  I know you're out there, the weekend is coming up and I want to write.

 What do y'all feel you need or want to read about *right now* ?

Cheers, stay strong!"	jdsalaro	post	16.030114977407425	male	White	0.0014973573852330446	na	na	na	11	selfhelp

If you have a philosophy background, I‚Äôd love to learn more about philosophy in bite sized chunks especially in a way that‚Äôs practical to everyday life.

"I really loved the blogging culture of early 2000s. I especially love blogs about things people are expert at. Some people are really into music and they put out some obscure stuff that worked great as recommendation.

 Back then Anime was only starting out in the west so I appreciated a blogger who wrote extensively about 80s/90s era Anime and it‚Äôs influence on American films. 

Philosophy and ethical blogs are great too, but I think they require large amount of knowledge base before it feels significant or worth reading."	jdsalaro	reply	na	na	na	0.0014973573852330446	no	strong	no	na	selfhelp

"""Start over"" sounds good if your surroundings suck. However, ask yourself whether the problems really are because of others. Or because of your own struggles? You see so often that people want to start over and they take their own mental issues with them, achieving no change in their lives except the physical surroundings. Is your life really so bad, or is it your emotional perception that makes you want to escape?

Other than that, I'd think you just have to move to another city or country to 'start over' and build up a social circle and hobbies there. Nothing else unless you take it literally, and you want to live in a hut in the forest."	hrl3m	reply	na	na	na	0.997928261756897	no	no	no	na	selfhelp

My sister (F23) doesn‚Äôt have many friends. She was very School focused and has a steady job and a bachelors degree where she wants to go back to get her masters. When she was in high school, she had a friend group that ended up being assholes by pulling a prank that went out of hand. She found 3 close friends. Recently, she‚Äôs finding out that one of those friends isn‚Äôt as much as a friend as she thought. Her other two friends have their own commitments, like kids and jobs that my sister understands because they make it clear. This specific friend however blurs it. She‚Äôll forget she made plans with my sister, because she already made plans with other people. She‚Äôs nice and all but the aspects of where she and my sister hold each other as friends isn‚Äôt the same. My sister doesn‚Äôt have many friends she can hang out with or make plans with. She‚Äôs shy in the way where our parents made fun of her for not being social or partying or going out. My mom used to asked me to take her with me to a party. She focused on school and went to college during the pandemic which didn‚Äôt help with making friends in college. Basically, how do I help my sister make friends?	gym-shark-bro	post	20.03796958069971	female	White	0.9970494508743286	na	na	na	3	selfhelp

I think your sister has to want this for herself. Making friends can be a challenge as the older we get the more narrow our social circles become. It will be up to your sister to expand her horizons and meet new people. I understand being in your sister's position of having no kids and not fitting into other's people lives. Going to a party like your parents are suggesting you to do may not help her or be her style. She may prefer quieter settings where she can make conversation with like-minded people. Perhaps doing her master's degree may just be that environment. You can definitely voice your concerns to your sister regarding her social life. Though be careful you do not overstep your boundaries. If she likes the idea of the two of you going out and doing things and having you help her along in this way, then that is awesome. However do not push her too hard or else you can compromise your relationship with her. Let her know you are here for her but let her take the reins.	gym-shark-bro	reply	na	na	na	0.9970494508743286	weak	strong	no	na	selfhelp
"I agree, must first determine her wishes...

Or actually, on second thought, don't do that, it'll make her feel all that much more awkward and will sabotage your efforts, put too much pressure on and fill her head with more of what she doesn't need.

I would suggest getting her to come with you to some hobby related activities, or even better, ask HER to help YOU find some peoples of similar interests, passions, etc.

Would be disarming, would help her to not feel weird about it and could be a gentle way of determining her position and wishes in terms of companionship

That way you could also demonstrate how easy it is to take that step to ask for their info and if they want to hang out with your wang out. I trust that she possesses a second hand wang? Or something actually funny?

"I'll preface this by saying I love my GF more than I could imagine loving someone. She's an amazing, strong and caring person.

During our relationship (18 months) we've had a lot of issues caused by me. When she first moved in with me from out of town I did a terrible job defending her from people I was close to who I thought were my friends. They were accusing her and misjudging her and basically being unaccpeting and hurtful and I kept giving them the benefit of the doubt and not defending her. In two instances which led to me cutting them off completely, she wanted me to confront them as I should about the issues and in both instances they proved themselves to be worthless friends. My mistake was not being able to stand up for her and defend her. This has caused a lot of trauma as you can imagine when she's trying to start a relationship and is not just not-accepted but hurt and targeted by these people and I don't do anything.

&#x200B;

I've lied during our relationshionship about things I've said to others and that is an easy fix. I practice honesty now and will not lie to her again but again there is trauma there from the huge arguments that have blown up over it. That's something I understand how to fix but include here for context.

&#x200B;

Now for a specific example - We recently had to get involved with the police during a row, a huge mistake fuelled by tiredness and chidish behaviour - due to my GFs chronic anxiety she is now terrified of the police knocking on the door. In my absent minded stupidness I have twice now begun whistling the theme song for The Bill which is a UK Police Show. This has predictable consequences in that she gets triggered and of course belives I am doing these things on purpose.

The other thing is in discussions or if someone needs doing, I rebel when I answer. Like for example if I am meant to do something, or asked to do something, instead of just sorting it or getting on with whatever it might be I rebel and start arguing the point whether I'm right or wrong. This reflex needs to stop and I am trying to find ways to identify what I am doing.

My questions is where do I even begin? Is there a book someone can recommend, or tell me why my absent mindedness has done this with the whistling, or my inability to act to defend the girl I love? It feels like so much for me to hone in on and change but these are annoying, damaging traits that are not helping my GF through difficult times"	LabOak	post	25.806979872963893	male	White	0.7974390983581543	na	na	na	2	selfhelp

"Most people who read self-improvement/‚Äùmotivational‚Äù subs, websites and forums do it for one reason: _to feel good_. They experience that sweet little dopamine kick from thinking, ‚ÄúFuck yeah, I can change my life!‚Äù They try out the advice for a little while, make a few changes‚Ä¶ only to eventually make excuses when it starts getting hard and then stop. _They go right back to square one._

Motivational speakers know this. Personal Trainers know this. Dietitians know this. The majority of people, despite constantly saying they want to improve their circumstances and live an awesome life, will inevitably fall back into old habits and never make any sort of lasting change. **They aren‚Äôt willing to put in the long-term consistent hard work it takes to achieve meaningful goals.**

Even as I‚Äôm writing this post, I‚Äôm well aware there‚Äôs a 95% chance you (yes, YOU) are one of the people who‚Äôll never put words into action. I'm a coach and unfortunately this is something I've had to deal with.

Your gut reaction is probably, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know me! You can‚Äôt predict that I‚Äôll fail, I‚Äôm going to succeed even though 95% of other people give up after a couple of months. **I‚Äôm different.**‚Äù Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll say to you:

**You (yes you, the human reading this right now) will never achieve jack shit in your life.** You‚Äôll try things, maybe stick with them for a few months to a year, but your heart will never be in it. You‚Äôll never give it your all. You‚Äôll live a comfortable life following the blueprint society sets out for you, but you‚Äôll always feel something is missing. You‚Äôll watch other people succeed and turn their lofty goals into reality, but you‚Äôll make excuses like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ethnic, if I was a white guy I could do it‚Äù, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not as busy as I am‚Äù or ‚Äúhe was born into an easy life‚Äù or ‚Äúhe‚Äôs tall and I‚Äôm short‚Äù. You‚Äôll try and convince yourself you‚Äôre truly happy, you‚Äôll try and self-medicate the guilt away, but deep down you‚Äôll always know: _you_ _chose_ _to be a loser._‚Äú

If it‚Äôs not abundantly clear, the intent of the above is to kick your fucking ass into gear and stop you being a little bitch. Prove me wrong."	LimeRevolutionary184	post	18.711982852367992	male	White	0.9974727034568787	na	na	na	5	selfhelp

"I like to look at things neutrally but this is just so much of a hard extremist of a side and such a bitchiness while proving you're a bad life coach.  


People normally don't change but have a desire to, and it is important to nurture this desire, help it, create ideal circumstances for it, like a plant. It will be hard and long, but when you find out what works and get into the habit you will prosper.  


The main thing I really dislike is your attitude about when faced with failure it is the true form of the person and showing that trying to help themselfs is useless. This is a horrible way to think and it leads to if someone fails once they relapse hard.  


In a good enviornment with a good life coach a mistake should be met with positivity and motivation to encourage people to still succeed even when their perfect ideals are shattered.  
You want them to give up and talk negative.

The last thing I don't like is the uneducatted tone of this. Dopamine is such a thrown around word that is ok to use, but you use it as a fancy word you don't understand.  
Dopamine is, simplily, a chemical that releases encouraging you to do something.  
Oh I want to play games, i get dopamine, oh im playing games and I want to continue, i get dopamine.  
This is what seperates games from work, the continual dopamine during gaming doesn't make you need motivation since you are already motivated to complete that task, while also taking no willpower since it is the easiest task to complete on your plate.  


Throwing around dopamine, making up a statistic, bolding scare words, and insulting people at their core on a community who wishes to support others on a hard journey just makes you shit.

There are people that believe that they are not capable of accomplishing anything. These people are right, because belief establishes reality. But belief can be changed which is what our friend here is doing. I like this though. He's basically speaking to himself. This probably works. 

He's telling the unmotivated part of HIMSELF that THIS is what it looks like to be motivated... You go out and you try help other people in any way you can.

"I have two exercises for you. But they'll only work if you do them with sincerity.

Exercise #1 - Imagine talking to your 14/15 self. They walk into the room and your first instinct is to tell them not to do any of the stuff they want to. You realize how stubborn you were and know that won't work. So then you consider yelling at them and telling them how awful things turn out because of them. But you realize that's not fair. They don't have your perspective. You're blaming them for choices you've decided are bad. They have nothing to do with your 14/15 year old self at the moment. Then you decide the simplest approach is to just listen to them. Let them tell their side of things and then you say ""I understand. No judgements.""

Exercise #2 - Imagine the ""fixation"" you mentioned as a wooden board and you're Uma Thurman for Kill Bill Vol. 2. You punch the board and it disintegrates.

"this is like my 100th post here,be brutally honest, what do i need to do? find a hobby and work on my self esteem? is it as simple as that? 

I watch others at work, they have these fun conversations, being witty, funny and stuff it makes me jealous that im not well at making conversations or making friends. im having daily battles with my mind to stop comparing my self with others and how others are different and everyone is unique, and that its pointless to compare. and everyone has problems they just are good at hiding it.

like for example downloading 300 YouTube vids to self help. probably another addiction, but what am i running away from? 

i have deleted Instagram and snap and discord permanently, haven't fapped or watched porn for like 5 days and i dont miss it..

am i just creating problems in my head? i been telling myself good affirmations for like 3 days now. like im good enough, that my self worth isn't based on external things

been watching astronomy videos, tv shows, learning another language and coding, working on listening better and have more conversations for the sake of having conversations and not to get attention or approval.

im exercising, meditating, working on learning mechanic skills, studying CS in college, im 21, i think i just need a hobby thats not  porn or girls. 
i been learning more about stuff i like like history, psychology, conspiracy theories, but nothing physical thats regular. went swimming a week ago but cant go again because i dont have a car, i like soccer but i dont have a team to play with, i would like a guitar but cant afford it
 
i dont know know what i want or who i want to be or how to find out who i want to be minus i want to be a confident, cool, charismatic guy, or at least one of these. i just don't know what career i want

many here said to get therapy, work on my self esteem, and find a couple hobbies 

and some said to not base my self worth on how many friends i have which are none or how many conversations i have and stop comparing myself to others. 

and some said that to stop comparing my self with others, but this is harder than i thought. 

some said to find my values and goals some said to master internal validation some said to find a passion some said to be less self critical"	Butcher__1	post	28.804271998248584	male	White	0.010870330035686493	na	na	na	6	selfhelp

"Routines are wonderful for mental health. I love mine. Here goes on how it works:

Set an alarm to wake up. Wake up, have breakfast. Eat lunch at the same time every day. Have an alarm for winding down time. Go do your night time routine: teeth, pajamas, bed, reading or watching some re-run of something you have watched countless times.

Fill your time between these routines with activities. Say go to the gym on x,y and z days at 10 am. Or study something for an hour at 2pm on monday, wednesday and friday. Walk the dog at 6 pm every day.

Let me tell you my routine so you see how it works. 

* Wake up every day 6:30. meds morning 8 am. (alarm on my phone) 
* Monday and Wednesday 9 am pilates. 
* Work from 10 am to 5 pm Monday to Friday. 
* Painting 2pm on Tuesday. (This one varies because I paint with a friend and we work out what day works. I call this ""therapy"" for the people at my work) 
* Lunch at noon, every day. 
* 5:30 pm when I get home, fist pajamas, then watch something interesting. 8 pm dinner, night meds and wind down. 
* 10:30 sleep. (also alarm on my phone) 
* 10 am therapy on Saturday, I have an alarm at 9:55 because I have been engrossed in some activity at home before and forgot my therapy.

I keep my wake up and sleep times consistent even in the weekends. If I have a party or some fun thing to do that does not fit in these times, I'll accommodate it by having a nap and or a snack before. Say someone asks me for lunch at 2 pm. I'll have a snack at noon, so I am not hangry and grumpy by 2. If I go to a party and plan on coming back much later, I'll have a restful day, a nap and then go.

The key is consistency. Do the same things at the same times every day, as much as possible and fill in your gaps - with breathing time between activities. Test it out for a month (less than a month is not enough for you to see if it works). Change what doesn't work and test again.

Edit to fix the list that broke down into a long paragraph."	hrl3m	reply	na	na	na	0.00322080310434103	no	strong	no	na	selfhelp
I‚Äôm (22 m) and man I don‚Äôt understand myself. It‚Äôs like I put myself in the worst situations and I‚Äôm always running away from my problems. For example, I talked to a therapist back in December and I was looking super forward to it. She told me to let her know when I‚Äôm going to be ready to start the sessions. I texted the number and she never responded but I assumed it was because it was her work number. The sessions were $75 each. I wanted to wait until I had some extra money, so I could go through with the sessions. When I felt ready for the sessions, she said she was not taking anymore clients. This is an example of me being cheap and procrastinating. I had the money but wanted to wait until I had extra money so I wouldn‚Äôt be too worried about spending $75 a session for therapy. Obviously I needed to just bite the bullet because I have no structure in my life.       It‚Äôs like I secretly self-sabotage and strive to be subpar. But I want to be above average and know I should be doing more. I procrastinate when I know I shouldn‚Äôt be. Sometimes I feel like my conscious talks to me to tell me what to do, but I just ignore it. It‚Äôs like the things I know I should be doing I don‚Äôt do them and the things I shouldn‚Äôt be doing (watching YouTube, (mindlessly scrolling, ) I do. I‚Äôve never had any structure growing up and It‚Äôs really effecting my life.	nineshawtyyy	post	12.105657392580397	male	White	0.9981377124786377	na	na	na	6	selfhelp
Lol Im 22 and I do the exact same thing, as far as my friend group goes, everyone i know falls victim to these same tendencies. Its really a battle every day to stay productive and its so easy to have things go well for like one week and then completely go back into the cycle of laziness. Wish I had a simple answer for us to follow but it really is just sheer determination and will power.

"Usually learned from a parent or role model. You can step off this path. Just pull the thread on blame, and watch the idea unravel.

Something happens. It's your fault. Your parents share the fault for letting you turn out the way you did. They did their best, but that might not have been good enough because their parents didn't have the time to show them how to raise a child that can live without the self-judgement. 

Your friends don't help the matter when they make jokes that they don't realize trigger you. So they're to blame as well for the state that you're in. But their parents must also share some of that blame - and their parents, and so on. 

If you are going to get into the business of chaining together ""facts"" that establish blame, you might as well just go all the way. Then you'll see that everyone carries the burden, and that it creates nothing but the feeling you have now.

"Tldr at end

21M. I got university starting in about 12 days and have to move to another city. I took 2 gap years and a bunch of entry tests, most of which I failed. I made all sorts of plan but followed through with none of them so basically wasted away 2 years of my life with some improvement and productivity here and there, on and off. 

Due to all that, my mental and physical health is in shambles. I'm lost in every aspect of my life, be it religious, social, personal, spiritual, you name it.

I have done this before a lot of times. I have pulled myself out of even deeper pits. But this time the problem is that I don't have much time.

Mental health: 24/7 foggy brain full of regrets of the past and anxiety of the future, and existential thoughts.

Physical health: sedentary lifestyle. Overeat like hell. Pear shaped body with the belly out as fuck.

Hobbies and passions have been put on hold due to the entry tests. I make time for them now or then. My main hobby is video editing and I have edited about 15 or 20 videos in the LAST 2 YEARS. I have lost touch with my hobbies.

Personal: Totally disconnected with my optimistic and motivated self. No more interested or excited about my goals and plans in life, which used to make me feel alive a few years back. (Travelling, becoming a filmmaker etc.)

Appearance is shit. Yellow teeth, balding hair, and fat ass belly. Altho I do take good care of hygiene, so I got that going for me atleast.

Tasks and responsibilities: pending over my head since the last 2 years. Every month, I make a plan, assigning dates to tasks, never follow through. I haven't even gotten my license made yet.

Habits/Routine: totally shit. Sleep at 4 am. Wake up 2 pm. No beneficial habits throughout the day.



Some say you have to take it step by step and day by day, one habit, one goal per day.

But idk, that approach has failed for me. The only 2-3 times I was able to stick to my improvement was when I went all in. 

But I don't have that sort of motivation anymore.

Tldr: wasted 2 years of my life in self-pity and despair, watching anime and youtube videos, that I could have utilized to make something of myself before I got into uni. As a result, my mental health, physical health, appearance and personal goals are all in shambles. And I've got 10 days to do something about it.

I just wanted to vent. I know all I must do to get myself out of here. Still, any advice or insight is appreciated. :)"	abdthirtythree	post	29.65916756805734	male	White	0.999416708946228	na	na	na	5	selfhelp

This is like a plant, you need to nurture it, get it into the correct pot with the correct surroundings without any bugs around and water it daily. Once you get into a habit of that you will progress a lot more.

"It's counter-intuitive, but research shows that happiness and self-worth are more easily accessed [by making others feel good, rather than oneself](https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/17439760.2021.1897867):

> Americans are guaranteed the right to ‚Äòpursue happiness‚Äô for themselves. But might they be better off if they pursued happiness for others? In five studies, we compared the two strategies, showing that, ironically, **the second pursuit brings more personal happiness than the first.** Retrospective study 1 (N = 123) and experimental studies 2 (N = 96) and 3 (N = 141) show that trying to make someone else happy leads to greater subjective well-being than trying to make oneself happy. In all three studies, relatedness need-satisfaction mediated the condition differences. Study 4 (N = 175) extended the findings by showing that **trying to make others happy is more personally beneficial than when others try to make us happy.** Study 5 (N = 198) found that feeding strangers‚Äô parking meters produced the effect even though the participant did not interact with the targeted other.

The study proposes several explanations for this. Personally, I think for people like you (and me <3 ) who are our own worst enemies, it's quite intuitive that it would work this way: Every time you prove to your subconscious ""Hey, I have the ability to selflessly improve someone else's life, or just their afternoon,"" you're staging a little coup against the notion that the world would be better off without you. It demonstrably is not.

You may also wish to look into [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy): 

> Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psycho-social intervention[1][2] that aims to reduce symptoms of various mental health conditions, primarily depression and anxiety disorders.[3] Cognitive behavioral therapy is one of the most effective means of treatment for substance abuse and co-occurring mental health disorders.[4] **CBT focuses on challenging and changing cognitive distortions (such as thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes) and their associated behaviors to improve emotional regulation[2][5] and develop personal coping strategies** that target solving current problems. Though it was originally designed to treat depression, **its uses have been expanded to include the treatment of many mental health conditions, including anxiety,[6][7] substance use disorders, marital problems, ADHD, and eating disorders.**[8][9][10][11] CBT includes a number of cognitive or behavioral psychotherapies that treat defined psychopathologies using evidence-based techniques and strategies.

Or, if you really wanna go for the Trifecta+1 of Proven Shit:

1. CBT
2. Regular walks outside
3. Meditation
4. Seeking out people to help, and helping them

Pretty much all of which will feel like total bullshit... until you look back in 6-8 weeks, and realize ""Aw fuck.

The reason it works so well is because it puts a hard restraint on when you can and can‚Äôt eat.

If you‚Äôre anything like me, any snacks in the fridge are going to be eaten. In fact, the best way to stop binging is to not have snacks in the fridge in the first place.

But why is where you are now not enough to love? I‚Äôm sorry you feel that way, that‚Äôs very tough. At some point we have to question the baggage of beliefs we choose to pick up everyday. It may not be your fault that you have adopted this belief that you need to change or that you are inherently unworthy, but it‚Äôs is your responsibility to choose what you choose and where you want to be. I don‚Äôt mean to preach. I have always struggled to feel like I had the permission to even think that I was worthy. Always feeling like I start that day in the negative or that I am bad, just so I could work hard to do good things just to feel like I am okay (not good, just not bad). That kept me always doing good things. But I came to a point where I asked why I have to believe that I am bad and unworthy. I came to the conclusion that it was like a safety blanket. I was comfortable in proving my worth because nobody could push me down if I was already at the bottom. It‚Äôs just no way to live a life with honor. I still struggle at times when I feel like I messed up or did something bad but I keep coming back to the fact that I don‚Äôt choose to believe I am bad or unworthy anymore. Instead I remind myself in every moment I feel myself backtracking that I choose compassion for myself, I trust myself even when I mess up and have to try again, I support myself and have my back, I choose grace and have space for error where I can grow, I choose patience, and strength, honor, resilience and honesty. Give yourself the gift of acceptance and choice. Everything will flow easier for you when you choose what you won‚Äôt pick up anymore and instead choose the things that remind you that you were always whole enough from the beginning. Good luck!

"Need some advice or someone to talk to. Please help.

Essentially I have lost my passion and any motivation. I‚Äôm 17 turning 18. Since mid 2022, I have just been unable to stick to any goals or routine I set for myself. I had some important exams back then so some of this may be burnout idk tho. Anyways since quarantine I started watching porn heavy so since quarantine I have struggled to cut out porn. I‚Äôve had some decent streaks and then I‚Äôll be in a rut where is beat so often. 

Family life - single parent but my mums partner isn‚Äôt a good role model. Family‚Äôs broke but I have a job and other things which covers things that I need. But since I have nobody to show me how to be with my money a large amount goes down quickly to food and clothes and also having to buy things or cover bills for my mum and sister. 

Can‚Äôt stay consistent in gym. I‚Äôm also skinny (5‚Äô9 68kg) with almost no muscle definition and I want to gain weight/muscle asap but I just cant eat enough either I just don‚Äôt eat or don‚Äôt finish my food (particularly food that I know I need to eat). I know exactly what I need to do to get to where I want to be in each facet of my life but almost everyday apart from when I go to the gym (where I don‚Äôt even push myself hard anymore) I end up just stuck in my bed on my phone or in my living room watching YouTube for the whole day. In fact it‚Äôs not even ig and tiktok that take up my time. it‚Äôs YouTube.

My grades have slipped majorly because I juust don‚Äôt revise anymore. I have serious exams that will genuinely determine my future in a few months now and I am completely unprepared. As a result I am terrified especially since I‚Äôm back to school so soon.

And every time ive fully cut out social media after like 25ish days (average) I fail to replace it with something productive so I just re-download and everything goes to shit.

Before this, I did well in my earlier education as in A**s A*s and Bs. 

Due to my previous school years ppl just know me as a goofy guy cus im always trying to make others laugh. Nobody really takes me seriously and I think they think I don‚Äôt notice it but I do and it hurts. But im tired of faking it now. I already feel like shit for having to resort to talking to others especially on this kind of platform. I just feel weak everyday then I wake to to the exact same life everyday idk what to do I need help because I feel like I‚Äôm ruining my life at 17. People that I respect have told me to get my act together. I‚Äôve been told I give up too easily. What makes it worse is that I never used to be like this. Even now the funny thing is I have good things going for me but I‚Äôm just coasting in life at the moment. I also have so many people that would dissapointed if I fail my exams or just fail to reach my goals and their expectations too.

Right now my priorities have to be education, money and physical/mental health.

I just need some help.

"You are in good company. Most people start right where you are. I know I did. It is really hard in this world to find a path with seemingly infinite decisions. Just by asking for help you are light-years ahead. Good Job!

It starts with habits. For me I can tell if my day will go well or poorly usually based on what I am filling my time with. Here are some steps. 

1. Delete any app that has an 'endless scroll'. This is facebook twitter, Ticktok (which is the worst), and the like.
2. Quit playing all phone games. and try to avoid using your phone as much as you can. 
3. Find a way to exercise that brings you joy in your soul. Try everything till something sticks. Hiking, Biking, weights, walking, yoga, kickboxing. Adding this discipline to your life will radically alter it. 
4. Commit to reading or listening to something beneficial every day. A finance podcast, a spiritual book, a self help book. Some to start with are 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' and '4000 Weeks by Oliver Burkeman'
5. Start Dreaming. What do you want? Short term long term? Personal, Professional, Spiritual, Friendships, Travel or anything. Get some things on actual paper that you want in life.

"I would like to know if anyone can actually solve the only problem that I am having with pursuing the career that I want to go into which is politics. I have done my research and out of 36 different areas of politics I do find all of them meaningful and I am passionate about them.

However their is only one of those areas which is an issue for me which is judging victims of crimes that I do not know or have never met and I would like to know how I can stop doing this?When I only look at the crime that has taken place and the number of victims. I am passionate and I find it meaningful to make sure that the proper punishment is given whether that is a life sentence or the death penalty.

However when I start to think about each of the victims in these situations more deeply I start to doubt myself and think that maybe some of the victims were actually bad people. Once I start to judge the victims then my passion and meaning fade away because I start to feel like I might be helping someone who I would consider a bad person.

An example of someone to me who would be a bad victim to me would be a guy who goes out to the bar with his girlfriend every week. He is delusional and paranoid anytime another guy even gets close to his girlfriend. If a guy gets close to her he intentionally instigates a fight with that person. He ends up seriously hurting multiple people at different times with the fights he starts.

Then one day he goes to the bar with her and instigates a fight with the wrong dude and loses his life. This is what I would consider a bad victim and someone who I would not feel successful getting justice for.

I would like to know how I can stop judging victims I have never met and I don't know? How can I just look at the crime and the number of victims and think about the proper punishment without judging the victims?"

The proper punishments and their different levels are clearly defined by law. ‚ÄúFirst degree murder, second degree, manslaughter, etc.‚Äù They all take into consideration the behavior of the victim and entire scenario of the crime. If you have a good understanding of them it takes your judgement out of it entirely. I also don‚Äôt really understand how this falls under ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù.

In this scenario it doesn‚Äôt really matter who the victims are‚Ä¶ when something like that happens you need to understand that it could‚Äôve been anyone who was the victim, and thats why something needs to be done to prevent it from happening again. Next time it happens the victim could be a little boy or girl.	NightShout	reply	na	na	na	0.004778854548931122	no	no	no	na	selfhelp
"Okay well that makes sense I didn't know that the law takes into consideration the behavior of the victim and the whole scenario. I have a better understanding now. 

Well it has to do with politics because lets say this person man who instigates fights I spoke about in my post doesn't lose his life in a bar. However he still does always start and instigate fights with other people and seriously hurts them. 

Then say he is out one day and he becomes the victim of a mass shooting with 9 other people. Now as a politician it could be my responsibility to help all of the victims get justice by advocating to change laws so that the criminal now receives the death penalty  for his actions and not life in prison. 

However in this situation how am I suppose to be passionate at public speaking events advocating to change the crime laws for all 10 victims when I know one of them was a bad person? How am I suppose to be passionate and find it meaningful to change the death penalty laws if one of the victims was a bad person like I described? 

Another example is when Ron Desantis changed the death penalty laws in Florida after the parkland shooter killed 17 people. How am I suppose to be passionate about changing the laws for everyone if some of the victims are like this guy I described who in my eyes is a bad victim?"

Honestly I (M26) feel like every month I‚Äôm battling myself with being disciplined. I‚Äôll have a week or 2 where I‚Äôm doing great and feel proud of myself but then suddenly I fall off completely. 

A bit of context: I‚Äôve been trading (fx) full time this year and the first few months were great. I had my strategy nailed down and was patient with my approach. But the last 4 months have been a nightmare. I‚Äôm constantly taking trades that are not with the strategy and constantly looking at the charts when there is no need. I‚Äôm basically lacking the discipline to sit on the sidelines and not self-sabotage. 

Another example is masturbation. It‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve been wanting to stop for a while as I see it as something pathetic at my age tbh + the long term health implications are not positive. Anyways, I‚Äôve even trying to go cold turkey on it and also stop gradually but neither has worked. The longest I‚Äôve gone is a week without doing that but then i go back to doing it daily. 

Any advice on making lasting changes and increasing discipline?

TLDR; trying to stop masturbating daily and not self-sabotage with work but lack discipline, need advice."	speedy_tortoise	post	31.849157094476077	female	White	0.9994781613349915	na	na	na	5	selfhelp
Step 1: Eliminate self judgement, it only fixes your attention to the thing. Telling yourself you need to stop will make it more difficult and you don't have to, so don't take that approach. Step 2: Read the book Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. This is not fake. This explains everything. Step 3: Find someone that understands the concepts in the Flow book and talk to them about it.	speedy_tortoise	reply	na	na	na	0.9994781613349915	no	no	no	na	selfhelp
"Discipline is a progress you can always improve on. You can't expect from day 1 to do it flawlessly without any mistakes. You are a human. Just do your best, fail and adapt. Failing is a learning curve you NEED to improve. Failure is great.   


Failing is a good indicator that something is not working for you. Discipline is one thing but making it managable for yourself is another thing you should focus on aswell. As for fx trading developing a strategy and staying commited to it also takes time. You will need to experience the bull and the bear market in order to develop your strategy. An approximate bull and bear market cycle is roughly 4 years. So anything below 4 years you can't call yourself a good trader. IMO.

"Well it starts with a decision.   


I'll give an example on how to start eating healthier and lose weight. Hypothetically you eat junkfood, drink sodas, eat candy....  


Start by making small changes weekly. Like eating a piece of fruit. Changing sugary sodas packed with calories to calorie-free sodas.   


Just make small and gradual improvements slowly. That way it's much more managable and it's not a shock. You slowly adapt to new habits. You did not adapt such habits in a day and you won't change them in a day. Make things as optimal and easy for yourself as possible.

"Recently, I was frantically trying to find this super important file on my computer. 

Guess where it was?   


Buried under a pile of old photos, random downloads, and stuff I don't even remember saving. It made me think how much time I lose because of all this clutter. 

I wanted to clean it up.

In fact, Cal Newport talks a lot about how keeping your tech organized can stop you from just aimlessly scrolling on your phone or computer.

So I did not just confine myself to the desktop. 

I wanted a FULL Digital declutter because‚Ä¶ 

‚Äî Less distractions = better focus.

‚Äî Devices will run faster.

‚Äî No more wasting time searching for stuff.

‚Äî Less procrastination and more getting stuff done.

‚Äî Just feel better overall because everything's organized.  
So here's what I can tell you:

&#x200B;

1‚Äî Emails - My inbox was a disaster. I had newsletters from 5 years ago. Tips: unsubscribe from stuff you don't read, get rid of old email accounts, use folders and tags, and block spam.

2‚Äî Computer Files - That downloads folder? A nightmare. So, organize what you need, and trash what you don't. Make good folders, have a system for naming your files, and get rid of unnecessary programs.

3‚Äî Phones - Got tons of apps? Me too. Deleting apps you don't use, turning off useless notifications, and organizing your photos can make a big difference.

4‚Äî Social Media - It's easy to get lost in the endless scroll. But if it‚Äôs stressing you out or wasting your time, maybe declutter. Unfollow accounts that bring you down, turn off notifications and maybe set daily limits.

5‚Äî Browser - Remember when you bookmarked everything? Time to clear out those you don't need anymore. And keep your browser running smoothly by clearing out cookies and using folders for your bookmarks.

6‚Äî  To-do list: Don't write down your tasks in different note-taking apps. I've started using Sunsama. It helps me organize my tasks and plan my day. It's been super useful. Also keeps me focused and away from distractions.

Has anyone else tried decluttering their digital space? What were your ""oh no"" moments and any tips you can share?"	samayash	post	28.90968416846168	female	White	0.003598709823563695	na	na	na	1	selfhelp

"I came across this lesson and thought I‚Äôd share it for anyone who needs to hear it because it has drastically helped me in my self-transformation journey.

Essentially, there are two ways we humans can get our dopamine: consumption or creation. Consumption is typically very passive. We can get feel-good chemicals on tap from lying in bed scrolling on our phones. Consumption methods include: TV, porn, food, alcohol, drugs, etc. If you have a proclivity for one of these things, that would be classified as an ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù. On the other hand, creative activities are classified as ‚Äúpassions‚Äù. Not many people would say they‚Äôre addicted to creative activities like learning, writing, painting, making music, photography, hiking, sports, etc. (and yes I realize nothing physical is created from exercise but you are creating and exerting energy). If you are finding yourself struggling to find ‚Äúyour passion‚Äù or not experiencing much joy in creation, odds are you‚Äôre consuming too much. Cut out the BS and soon you will discover things you never knew you thought were fun.

I‚Äôm a 24 M, for the last three months I cut out all social media scrolling, alcohol & drugs, porn, junk food. I still watch TV sometimes but choose your vices lol. In this time, I have delved into entertaining myself daily with working out, surfing, reading, making music, sports, hiking and more I‚Äôm probably forgetting. I feel more motivated to work. Socializing without alcohol is fun like when I was a kid which is something I never thought I‚Äôd say. And you really don‚Äôt have to go as hard as I am. I noticed things changing in under a week. It‚Äôs just working for me so why change it?

If you are someone who spends a lot of time consuming for fun, stopping is hard. At first, you will be bored, you might not know what to do. That‚Äôs the point. You will naturally seek out new things to fill the time and form new healthy habits. 3 months ago I was writing Reddit posts asking how to escape depression, today I feel the best I ever have. I hope this helps at least one person because it helped me tons.

"Dopamine is a thrown around word, and its a lot easier to call it something else like the enjoyment chemical.  


What the enjoyment chemical does is it makes your brain happy when you do something you enjoy, encouraging it to do such thing.

I want to eat, i get enjoyment chemical thinking about it so I act on it, I like the food and want to take another bite and get enjoyment chemical making me enjoy it and giving motivation to continue and happiness.

"If I were to select the three most significant lessons I've learned during my journey of transitions, I would choose the following:¬†

&#x200B;

**Lesson 1:** **To heal and grow, you must learn to release and let go**

To rise above my rock bottom, letting go was the most helpful step I took. One practical way I embraced this process was by adopting minimalism, inspired by Marie Kondo's book, ""The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up."" Clearing my physical space of unnecessary items brought immense relief, as it reflected an inner transformation. Additionally, I let go of connections that no longer served me, decluttering my social media and reducing its influence in my life. This internal and external de-cluttering created a serene environment that enabled me to focus on my inner journey. I am immensely grateful for the clarity, peace, and relief it brought to my life.¬†

&#x200B;

**Lesson 2: Your disappointments can unfold as your biggest blessings in life.**

For nearly three years, I mourned the losses I experienced, accompanied by a range of emotions, including sadness, anger, guilt, and most prominently, disappointment. As a driven and goal-oriented person, I found it challenging to accept when life deviated from my desired path. However, delving into spirituality allowed me to release these ego-driven thoughts and desires, leading me to recognize the deeper meaning of life. Consequently, what I once viewed as disappointments turned into a profound sense of gratitude. I learned that sometimes, what we desire may not align with what's truly best for us. The universe has a plan, and it always provides what we need at the right time. Surrendering to life's flow and releasing expectations can lead to magical outcomes.¬†

&#x200B;

**Lesson 3: The ultimate key to rising above rock bottom is to persevere and keep moving forward, regardless of the obstacles in your way.**

When life throws unexpected curveballs, our natural instinct is to resist and hold on to familiarity, seeking protection from the past. However, resisting only prolongs the challenges we face during transitions. Instead, embracing these changes with acceptance on an emotional level can be the most efficient solution. Simultaneously, on a behavioral level, we must take action and keep following our routines. The temptation to withdraw or avoid responsibilities might be strong, but we must remind ourselves that life continues, and so must we. Even during or after a transition, we should find at least one consistent thing in our lives and keep working on it. This becomes the grounding force that holds us steady amidst uncertainties and upheavals.¬†

&#x200B;

In the darkest period of my life, a spark of hope was ignited when my best friend told me, ""Your struggles are preparing you to help others navigate similar challenges in the future."" Her belief in me, seeing parts of myself I never recognized, planted the seed for a new path. Now, six years later, her vision has come to fruition‚ÄîI've become a personal growth coach, guiding aspiring millennials through transitions and aligning their lives with their passions and values. I am overflowing with gratitude for the profound lessons learned during my life transitions, and now, embracing my calling, I am dedicated to sharing these insights with anyone else on a similar transformative journey.¬†"	traceyzhang	post	38.38980529611679	male	White	0.0013077280018478632	na	na	na	3	selfhelp

"I used to have recurring suicidal thoughts, and this is what helped me move past that and heal:

* **Don't try to navigate this alone - get help/support.** Tell someone you know, love and trust, like a family member! I told my mom and she was able to talk through this with me whenever the thoughts would come back. Or call a suicide hotline or 911!
* **Speak to a doctor - it may be that your hormone levels are off, or maybe something is just out of balance.** For instance, I realized that I was dangerously low on Vitamin B, which was greatly contributing to depression and suicidal thoughts. I also ended up working with a holistic doctor, who helped me get on natural supplements to help balance my hormones. Now, whenever I'm feeling super depressed, it's a sign I'm probably low on Vitamin B. I get a shot, and feel WAY better!
* **Take care of yourself** \- get 8hrs of sleep each night, workout/walk daily, eat 3 square meals daily and eat as healthy as possible. This makes a HUGE difference. Sleep deprivation and a lack of workout out can really cause us to play mind games.
* **Get invested in a community** \- I began getting involved in my local church community, and by finding friends there, I felt more pleasantly distracted, made friends, and had less suicidal thoughts. Also, I now had people to think about and care for who were also going through struggles. It got my mind off of my own problems and onto helping others...
* **Remember that YOUR LIFE IS PRECIOUS** \- God says that you were ""fearfully and wonderfully made"" and in His Word, He says ""Do not kill"" (that includes yourself) - so whenever you think of that (and this is what ultimately healed me), I told God I didn't want to think about this anymore and prayed and asked Him to help me never even consider this as an option anymore.Now, I take all my cares and burdens to Jesus through a personal relationship with Him - this is something He offers to everyone, and it radically and completely changed my life. By having a friend in Jesus, it's given me confidence to make friends with others and given me peace that surpasses understanding.
   * **This is the best piece of advice I could give you, and the only one that truly changed my life.** ""For God so loved the world (us :) that He gave His only begotten son, that whoever should believe in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life"" - He came to give us abundant life.

"Hi everyone, a lot has been going on in my life recently and one of the more prominent events have been learning how to become better at communicating. 

Perhaps my upbringing where I had regularly been cut off or unable to get a word out has left me with a distorted/negative response system. My parents are foreign and I'm the oldest sibling. 

In short, a subtle nuance or rather me perceiving someone as communicating something negatively, positively, funnily, sexually, or crudely has me baffled. I have previously been described as scatterbrained, but smart.  Well, lately I feel some people are word smiths and I've been reading too deep in to what people are saying. Perhaps I'm overly fixated on word choice, tone, and meaning. It's like I split it many different directions and feel anxiety when I try reading people. It's something I'm trying to get better at, but it is super nervous wrecking. Am I the only one here? Have you had an easy or hard time communicating to others at home, workplace, or just out and about? I can strike up conversation, but am I over analyzing word choice and fooling myself into thinking everyone can slight me/a loved one/or a coworker at any moment?

Any comments/advice?

I feel you. The more is going on inside your head, the more insecure and overthinking you are, the harder it makes communication. With time and experience it will come naturally. Once you feel comfortable and confident you will be able to communicate just as naturally as the people you admire. Find people where you can be yourself, where you can say what‚Äôs on your mind without overthinking. Take good care of yourself and the rest will follow with time. ‚úåüèªü§ç	Euphoric_Ad548	reply	na	na	na	0.14626027643680573	weak	no	no	na	selfhelp

Everyone has done things they regret, the importance in the event should be learning a valuable lesson. Even bad events in life can turn out to be gifts in the future. As for being more responsible, I personally find once I find a very small, easy, minor task, that I can start with and manage to accomplish that, it usually snow balls into me doing more chores and things I needed to get done, just starts with that first one, sometimes as simple as putting a single glass away or cleaning one thing in the house	BLUEAR0	reply	na	na	na	0.9981829524040222	weak	strong	no	na	selfhelp
"i‚Äôve never had a diagnosed mental illness but for a few months now, since summer started i‚Äôve been feeling this background numbness. it feels like i no longer have any zest for life. 

here are some things i think are sources of this:

1. everyone ard me is getting internships at elite companies while my own is not very impressive
2. my best friend is studying overseas with an awkward time difference
3. all my other friends here are in happy relationships and i feel like i‚Äôm no one‚Äôs top priority 
4. i ended up using part time work as a distraction from thinking of these feelings properly(which i nvr did before, i used to be very in tune with my feelings)

a small argument with a close friend over text(who is not a very emotional person) triggered a panic attack in public, and that had triggered me into thinking of a way to fix this. 

im saving up so i don‚Äôt have money to spend on therapy, my parents are very asian and very unemotional and i feel like ive trauma dumped on my friends enough.

"Over the last year my mental health is taking a serious dive, I Think it all started when I accidentally said something that upset my girlfriend a lot(my first one to be exact) and ever since I keep beating myself up over smaller and smaller mistakes I do. I'm afraid people don't like me, I take offence in every little thing because I feel like people are attacking me beacause I have no self confidence and see myself as a massive loser, going back to uni at 25 I'm constantly comparing myself to my friends who seems to be having succesfull happy fun lives. I keep being worried my girlfriend doesnt love me and it's just a show because she wants to use me. I need constant reassurence and support from her and after I'm done whining to her I feel even worse cus I feel I'm being a total pussy and that's definitely not attractive for her to be with a man like that. I'm very worried she will leave me cus I'm not good enough and mentally ill. 

I know one of the things is to focus on present but my attention span is in the gutter, don't know why even. And I hate myself for it even more, like every functioning human being is able to be in the moment but I constantly want to run away from life, and this gut wrenching anxiety. 

I engage in mild self harm because I need to punish myself for being worse. I am on anti anxiety meds but they dont seem to be working and I feel like I'm human garbage cus I need meds to be alive even( I used to be on antidepressants in the past but I hate how numb they make me) Just anything that could be interepreted as being worse I will find a way to make it such.

I can't learn new skills cus I get frustrated I can't get something done, and keep fueling my hatred.

Here is how it usually goes, I try to do something, can't focus, make a mistake, hate myself and either throw a rage tantrum or cry.

I'm socially anxious and awkard, no idea how to make new friends even.

I'm always trying to get back up but a small mistake takes me days to recover from. And Even then I get better only for a day or three untill something throws me off again. Like this week I was tormenting myself that my gf doesn't care about me and later she told me the tought we are drifting aparat which made me panic even more and now I'm stuck again. And after every time I get back up I have even less strength to keep going cus it's just tiring and I have another reason to see myself as a loser cus i failed to get  better again.

"Hi! This is a burner account, I don't want to post this from my main account.

To put into context: earlier this year, I felt like a million bucks. Had an awesome group of friends and started an internship on a company I was really hyped to get into. Then, on June, got hired and did an awesome party to conmemorate my goals.

However, after that everything has been slowly going downhill. I told them I could hang out with them on the weekends because my work shift is BRUTAL and I have to conmute 1h daily. Even so, they  started to hangout without me, and I wouldn't mind as soon as they're happy, but when I tried to be on a plan with them, one of the friends started to lie about the reasons they wouldn't hangout the day I was available, the group was backing him up and cancelling the plan, and when I discovered his lie, it turned into a heated discussion which ended up with them dumping me from their group.

If that wasn't enough, on the job they were giving me more and more work because I was ""so good"" and it was affecting my stress levels. Coupled with that on the past month they tasked me to train a new employee which hasn't ended their studies, was clueless and is a dick to me, it was taking a toll on me.

Talked to the boss about it, and pretty much told me to ""suck it, we're a team here"".

Friends left me behind, and the work environment becoming worse was starting to take a toll on my health, to the point this last week my neck snapped from all the stress and I'm on sick leave, which my boss didn't like at all, he thinks I'm exaggerating my pain.

He hasn't talked to me since this monday when I sent him the medical records and my contract ends next month. I'm afraid it'll affect the possibilities of renovating.

I feel miserable. Haven't recovered from the breakup with my friends and dealing with this pain is not good. And with the possibility of losing my job, I feel lost."	Beneficial-Method-35	post	26.714789169535003	female	White	0.999387264251709	na	na	na	4	selfhelp

If you love your job, and can see yourself succeeding in a career, prove them wrong and bounce back. Give yourself some time from your friends, let them dwell on what they did. Real friends will be back to support you, especially if they see you thriving they will be the ones to feel bad for leaving you, if they leave you at your lowest, it is better what happened did happen.

Hi! I'm a 21 M and I'm a college student at a university. I was Uber driving a girl around town and we chatted about our lives, and what we were doing this weekend, and then my phone ran out of battery. I asked her if I could borrow a phone charger and she agreed, I didn't want to leave with it so I charged it in my car and waited for it to charge so I could drop her off in the app. She then came up to my car and gave me her phone number saying that we could hang out later. I was honestly flabbergasted and confused inside? I didn't know why but I felt like I was dying inside. I've literally never had this happen to me before, I was always the weird kid at school. Am I just having shock or is this a precursor to something?	KillerHatDude	post	9.909451128605028	female	White	0.9969573020935059	na	na	na	12	selfhelp

One thing I realized is I don't even go on Reddit enough because I don't care about opinions unless it benefits me. I think that is the same for you isn't it? Why would you listen to someone unless you know that somehow it is going to benefit you? I realize if I need facts on something, I'll read a book! If I want to see any trends I'll surf Reddit to watch the trends but really at the end of the day your opinion is only objectively useful to me and you as the producer do not actually matter unless you're someone I want to be involved with because it benefits my social status.  Reddit is silly, I mean I get why some companies would scrape data from it but other than that why? Like who cares?

"How do you learn to be alone? Like on purpose? I want to be alone and able to do my own thing but I keep finding myself gravitate towards this friend group that I'm pretty sure doesn't even want me around but were all homeless and too nice to really tell someone to go away unless their being a complete ass. It's the only group of people I have that I can hang around but they still like verbally abuse me and put me down and its ment as a like ""rough love"" but like when its directed at me it's so much more and worse than what we ever give to the rest of the group. 
Idk I'm pretty sure this is an adhd thing where I'm craving attention/stimulation but being homeless you're kind of isolated and lack options for anything.

"Believe it or not, I can identify with this situation. I can only speak from my own experience, but what I found with those friend groups is that they're not actually friends as much as they are, like, hardship-companions. 

You're all in a tough spot. Maybe some enjoy the liberty of being unhoused, but it sounds like you don't. 

When some people are unhappy, they take it out on those around them. If you have a group of people who are all unhappy for their own different reasons, everyone takes everything out on everyone. 

I'm willing to bed everyone in your friend group feels the way you do‚Äîor at least somewhat. 

You asked to how to be alone. My advice to you is to not do that. You're lacking in one of your basic needs right now and this is not the time to go solo. (Again, speaking from experience.) 

I would recommend instead of going it alone, try to force yourself to find better friends. 

Are drugs/alcohol involved? That's a big thing that pulls friends like that together. There are programs like AA and NA that provide community for people who want a better life. 

It's not easy to choose a better situation, especially on your own, but I'm telling you as someone who was once in your shoes, the best thing you can do is choose the better over the familiar. 

Be the square/nerd/whatever and take all the handouts your community offers. Be the one that makes all the volunteers glad they do what they do. 

There's a concept called, ""crabs in a bucket."" 

The idea is that crabs can't escape from a bucket because whenever one tries to climb out, the others instinctively pull it back into the group. 

Based on what you've told me, you don't need to be alone, but rather fight off the crabs that are pulling you down.

"anytime i see a guy having a fun conversation with a girl i immediately get jealous and get to roasting my self, because i can barely get a word out of a girl in texting. 

i dont have friends or a fun or cool personality and i always compare my personality with everyone

i dont have long conversations because i don't know how to be truly interested in people, i tried very hard just to fail and cant make friends 

i think i just want peoples attention or approval or validation, or that im desperate and needy and need to make others like me so i can feel like i have a cool personality 

i deleted social medias now, but i think i was distracting my self by messaging endless girls online just to get attention or approval 

Maybe im so self centered...i think my perception of my personality is ""people pleasing boring annoying Mr nice guy""

i go into a Spiral everytime i run into someone who's better at something than me. most times its when someone's charming, charismatic,  good at convos, likeable, cool, funny, smart

oh he has a ""better personality or more money or better looking or a GF or basically anything at all""  getting sick of this... 

people here adviced me to look for a hobby or therapist to talk with, i cant find any

if i had money both would be solved. i would buy a car and get to places where i could do an activity. 

a week ago i went to swimming and it was fun, but i can't go again unless my brother goes...

i dont wanna spend my entire life chasing people or staring into my phone, i want to go on adventures even if doing it alone

i have work and college, recently i been doing anything that my mind tells me not to. 

i been going without social media or porn for a week but i get bored and i want my dopamine hits so i get back to it.

although you and i seem to differ on personalities, we struggle similarly. you are doing great by being self aware because i have a friend like you and it hurts to watch her self esteem deteriorate after she puts all of her effort into getting validation from men. In my case, i recently started seeing a EMDR therapist who helps resolve traumatic memories so you aren‚Äôt stuck in fight or flight mode. i recently discovered that one of my triggers is feeling like i‚Äôm not good enough so i over compensate with my personality and have become a pathological people pleaser. i encourage you to first develop a safe space, think about what your senses feel and relax and feel them. Name your safe space. mine is cuddling with my boyfriend but it could be in your bed, a place , even a person. then try to peel back the layers of insecurities. maybe speak them out loud, share with a therapist or write them down. and once you start to get upset, move to your safe space in you mind. go through those feelings again until you calm down and repeat to yourself that you are safe and beautiful. by extracting the root cause of your emotions enables you to then have a target to neutralize. if you are unhappy with looks, start making small and healthy changes. up your water intake, try no alcohol for a month, focus on what your body is asking for. Not all bodies were made to fit the mold that society flashes in our faces. feed your body with nutrients and vitamins. you will start to feel better and more fulfilled. I struggle with dopamine searching too and anytime you feel the urge to relieve yourself, do some crunches, get up and do something and shift your mind. be kind to yourself and regression is normal and okay. find something that you love doing and perfect it. trust me, love pops up when you aren‚Äôt looking for it.

"I got something on that on Jaun Serves... Cannot post a link so here it is:

In today's fast-paced world, it's all too easy to fall into the comparison trap.   
  
We constantly find ourselves measuring our worth against others, whether it's in terms of appearance, achievements, relationships, or even material possessions.   
  
The pervasive influence of social media only exacerbates this phenomenon, as we are bombarded with carefully curated snapshots of other people's seemingly perfect lives.   
  
It's no wonder that the majority of individuals struggle with feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.  
  
Let me share a powerful story of a client I worked with to illustrate the impact of comparing oneself to others and the transformative power of embracing authenticity.  
  
Meet Sarah, a remarkably attractive woman who seemingly had it all. Despite receiving numerous compliments about her physical beauty, Sarah struggled with self-esteem issues. She couldn't see the beauty that others saw in her and constantly felt inferior to other women in her life. Her self-worth hinged on comparing herself to others, particularly women she admired.  
  
There was one woman in particular whose hair she envied. Sarah believed that this woman's hair was longer, thicker, shinier, and healthier than her own. As a result, she felt her own hair was lackluster and unappealing. She then moved on to comparing her abs with someone else, and her cheekbones and jawline with yet another person. She didn't see the whole individual; instead, she fixated on specific attributes that she believed made them better than herself.  
  
The consequences of this constant comparison were devastating. Sarah couldn't fully appreciate her own beauty, as she was too busy focusing on the perceived shortcomings in comparison to others. It was a never-ending cycle of self-deprecation and dissatisfaction.  
  
But why do we fall into the comparison trap in the first place?  
  
Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ""envy is ignorance and imitation is suicide.""   
  
When we compare ourselves to others, we are essentially rejecting our own unique identity. We may think that others have it all together and that we need to be more like them to be accepted and loved. But the truth is, we can never be truly authentic if we're constantly trying to be someone we're not.  
  
Each of us has a different set of advantages and disadvantages. We are a blend of strengths and weaknesses, and it's through this beautiful mix that we find our authenticity.   
  
Comparing ourselves to others only serves to destabilize our self-worth and prevent us from fully embracing who we are.  
  
So, how do we break free from the comparison trap and embrace authenticity?  
  
The first step is to identify the traits we admire in others and see where we possess those same traits in our own unique form.   
  
By doing so, we level the playing field and recognize that we are just as valuable and capable as the people we look up to.  
  
Next, stop trying to live someone else's life.   
  
Instead, we should focus on living in alignment with our own highest values and meaningful objectives. This means prioritizing what truly matters to us, not what society or others dictate as important. When we live congruently with our priorities, we fill our days with actions that are meaningful to us, and this is when our self-worth rises.  
  
It's important to remember that we are not here to compare ourselves to others. Our journey is about comparing our daily actions to our own highest priorities. It's about fulfilling our unique dreams and aspirations, not trying to be a carbon copy of someone else.   
  
Embracing our authenticity means embracing our true selves, with all our imperfections.  
  
By acknowledging and appreciating the traits we possess, we can stop placing others on pedestals or in pits. Instead of feeling inferior or superior, we see others as equals, recognizing that each individual has their own set of strengths and weaknesses.   
  
We begin to appreciate the diversity and uniqueness of humanity, including our own.  
  
It's time to give yourself permission to be authentic.   
  
There is no need to fix yourself when you embrace who you truly are.   
  
The traits we admire in others are reflections of the magnificence within ourselves.   
  
We may not be aware of it, or we may be too humble to admit it, but the truth is that nothing is missing in us.  
  
Every trait, both positive and negative, exists within us in our own unique form. When we stop seeking fixes and start loving ourselves for who we are, we allow others to love and appreciate us for our authenticity.  
  
It's a beautiful realization that we are not here to be like anyone else. We are here to be ourselves, to stand on the shoulders of giants while staying true to our own path. When we fully embrace our authentic selves, we can live a life of purpose, fulfillment, and genuine self-appreciation.  
  
So, let's break free from the comparison trap and start celebrating our uniqueness.   
  
Let's value ourselves and others for the multifaceted individuals we are.   
  
Embrace your true self, and watch as your life unfolds in a way that is meaningful and profoundly fulfilling.  
  
Love

"Hopelessness and helplessness are possibly the two biggest roadblocks to your success ‚Äì the two things that fuck you up the most. They‚Äôre both insidious too, in that they sit under the surface, in your subconscious, without you necessarily realising. They sabotage your success ‚Äì it‚Äôs really bloody hard to make changes and work towards success **if you think nothing you do will ever really work and nothing really matters.**

Hopelessness/helplessness goes beyond depression ‚Äì it‚Äôs far more insidious. Hopelessness isn‚Äôt just ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this will work‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs deeper than that. It‚Äôs a completely overwhelming knowledge that this won‚Äôt work ‚Äì often expressed with ‚ÄúNever‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlways‚Äù statements. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be successful‚Äù. ‚ÄúI will always be a loser‚Äù. Like you‚Äôre 100% adamant it‚Äôs true; like your failure is already guaranteed before you‚Äôve even tried.

If you believe you‚Äôll always be a failure, & you‚Äôll never be successful, then you‚Äôre going to self-sabotage yourself. You‚Äôll think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm destined to be a failure, so I may as well hurry up and fail so I can get it over and done with.‚Äù You‚Äôll get in your own way, and you won‚Äôt fully follow-through with the advice I/others give you. You won‚Äôt fully commit to taking action; instead just half-assing everything because deep down you‚Äôre convinced it won‚Äôt really work‚Ä¶ so why even bother?

If you‚Äôre feeling hopeless, convinced you can‚Äôt I want you to make your way through these questions, and answer them. Either write it all down on a big piece of paper, or on your computer. Here's some I've heard from people I've worked with over the years:

*   Why do other successful people deserve love, but not me? Why am I special?
    
*   Am I just putting up bullshit excuses like these ones?
    
*   Why do other people deserve to overcome his depression, but not me?
    
*   Why wouldn‚Äôt girls like me? Is there really something wrong with me? Can I improve that or work around it?
    
*   Do I want to feel helpless and hopeless? Does my hopelessness help or protect me in some way ‚Äì am I getting something out of it? (Watch this podcast, it covers this topic in great detail and will blow your mind).
    
*   Do my flaws really mean nobody will ever like me? Can I make up for my flaws by having some really strong, awesome strengths?
    
*   What attributes a successful person would have, that I don‚Äôt?
    
*   Can I work on getting those attributes?
    
*   Do I deserve to be miserable and unhappy? Why? Why do other people deserve to be happy, but not me?
    
*   Am I destined to be a failure for life, or can I change that?
    
*   Did the universe/God/whatever preordain me to be a failure? Does that have to be the case, or can I rise up and change the course of my own life?
    

\[I ‚Äì Andy ‚Äì am a good example of this\]. Everyone I admire learned how to improve themselves, learned how to lose fat, learned how to make friends, learned how to beat depression, learned how to overcome their negative thoughts‚Ä¶ Can‚Äôt I just learn all those skills too, one by one?

After a very messy breakup from a long term relationship years back, I spent most of my time doing a whole heap of soul-searching; asking myself all the questions I wrote above. Questions like, ‚ÄúWhy do other people deserve to have love, but not me? Am I really that much of a fuckup? Why can‚Äôt I just go outside and meet new people? Am I destined to be a failure for life, or can I change that?‚Äù

Digging deep and uncovering those answers too me a hell of a lot of time and effort. It was hard ‚Äì becoming self-aware and self-knowledgeable always is. The thing that helped me most was posting about it on forums every day; I used various forums like a journal. I also talked to my mates about my fears and insecurities and my hopelessness. I read a tonne of self-help books (start with You Can‚Äôt Afford The Luxury Of A Negative Thought). I listened to as many motivational podcasts as I possibly could. I surrounded myself with as much positive material as I could ‚Äì I was literally trying to brainwash myself into believing I could be successful.

You need to do the same ‚Äì brainwash yourself into believing you can beat your hopelessness and become successful. If a loser like me can do it, you sure as hell can too. You'll need to literally try to brainwash yourself believing you can reach your goals, so that you‚Äôll go out and actually take actually and try.

And ‚Äútry‚Äù is the key word ‚Äì you just have to try. You don‚Äôt have to 100% believe you can be successful. I always have doubts ‚Äì even to this day. By by taking tiny little baby steps towards your goal each day, you‚Äôll eventually get there ‚Äì just like I did.

It can be a long process ‚Äì months, or years. Success never comes easily. But over the weeks if you just keep grinding, you‚Äôll start noticing little positive changes; little signs that your efforts may be starting to work. You have to try to brainwash yourself into believing, ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs possible I could be successful.‚Äù

If you believe you‚Äôll be a failure, then you‚Äôre going to self-sabotage yourself. You‚Äôll think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm destined to be a failure, so I may as well hurry up and fail so I can get it over and done with.‚Äù You‚Äôll get in your own way, and you won‚Äôt fully follow-through with the advice I/others give you. You won‚Äôt fully commit to taking action; instead just half-assing everything because deep down you‚Äôre convinced it won‚Äôt really work.

I know its hard, but you have to rewrite the narrative that‚Äôs running in your head. You have to change it, even just a tiny tiny bit. When I didn‚Äôt think I could be successful, I just made a tiny tiny change to my thoughts: ‚Äù Ok, I‚Äôm probably going to be a failure. But there‚Äôs a 0.0001% chance I could be a success. There‚Äôs at least a TINY bit of hope. I‚Äôm probably going to be a failure, in fact it‚Äôs very likely, but maybe, just maybe, I might possibly be at least a tiny bit of a success. Maybe. Probably not. But maybe.‚Äù

And you have to hang on to that 0.0001% chance, grab it desperately and never let go. ‚ÄúOk, I know I‚Äôm probably not going to be successful‚Ä¶ But there‚Äôs still that 0.00001% chance. That‚Äôs still at least a possibility. So I‚Äôll keep pushing forward, I‚Äôll keep making progress, I‚Äôll keep working on my goals just for that 0.00001% chance. I have a better chance of winning the lottery but fuck it, reaching my goals would be way better than winning the lottery. Ok, I‚Äôll keep going.‚Äù

That 0.0001% has to be a flame you never let die out. A flame you keep burning. You have to always hang onto that hope, during your worst moments, during your moments of doubt (you‚Äôll have millions of those). You have to hang onto that 0.00001% chance when you feel like quitting. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt quit, or that 0.00001% chance will become a 0% chance. And then there‚Äôs no point to being alive.‚Äù

As long as you‚Äôre alive, as long as there‚Äôs a single breath in your body, there‚Äôs a 0.0001% chance you could succeed and build the life you‚Äôve always wanted. 0.00001% is infinitely larger than 0%.

0.00001% isn‚Äôt going anywhere. You‚Äôll always have that 0.00001% chance. Just never ever quit, and that flame will continue to burn.

I believe in you."	LimeRevolutionary184	post	21.80167578103257	female	White	0.01066088117659092	na	na	na	1	selfhelp

"I will be texting a girl online and i try my hardest to think of something cool, interesting, funny, smart to say or ask them questions they reply with 1 words like yes or no, or not at all mostly, truthfully i dont even know what to talk about or what to say 

they say one word and my brain is like ""Im cool and stuff"" i immediately think that im a likeable person

if they dont reply those thoughts hit me like a rock.. ""im not good enough, not cool enough to have a have a friend or not funny or smart or intelligent .. etc""  or basically anything remotely positive 

with girls it happens in texting, with people it happens in conversations, when i see people having fun, being witty, funny, cool i get jealous 

i see how i have no friends while other guys have friends and can never run out of things to talk about and have girls they can talk to or girls chasing them"	Butcher__1	post	26.956705162761484	male	White	0.9988369345664978	na	na	na	2	selfhelp

You lack confidence, my man.. and maybe are a little too in your head about things. One word replies are never a good idea unless the person is busy and they're not looking for a conversation anyway, just an answer. If someone keeps giving you one word replies, they're not a mature person or aren't worth your time if they're not busy at that moment. I know it sounds cliche, but just try being yourself. Ask then questions, then comment on what they just said and maybe tell a bit about yourself too before moving forward. Don't beat yourself up.

Fresh air and a change of scenery can do wonders. And sometimes, just doing nothing for a while and letting my mind wander helps me discover new interests.

Not sure the exact circumstances here. But in my experience it may have a lot to do with being abused as a child. Sometimes that just means that one of your parents was just a huge asshole you had to tiptoe around during childhood. They may not have ever even hit you, touched you, or called you awful names.

When you learn as a child that love comes from showing certain behaviour, you'll feel like you won't be loved if you don't do exactly that. Can be anything. Taking care, performing, discipline, shouting, staying quiet etc
Path to healing means realizing that it was a means of survival as a kid, and keeping rhe past in the past while learning to love yourself /unconditionally/. I would recommend for now somatic experiencing therapy and inner child healing hypnosis on youtube or better, with a specialist.

Today, I'm still in college but now I've got more friends than ever, my confidence is higher than ever, I started developing narcissistic tendencies to overcome low confidence, and that somehow resonated well with the girls, I have no idea how, the bottom line is, use make-up you knobhead.

"Take it from someone that quit twice and is smoking again. 

Smoking first induces anxiety and then relieves it. You get anxious because you want to smoke, when you smoke it feels so much better. 

After you quit, I mean a few months after, your anxiety is lower all the time. That is the magic, the nicotine does not get lower, it is already low, so you dont feel the need to relieve that tension.

Two things you need to know in order to quit: it is going to be hard. I used every tool in my arsenal to deal with quitting. First time was medication. Second time was nicotine patches. Plus all the self control everybody talks about. Going cold turkey will tax your self control to the breaking point, get as much help as you can, because you will need. 

To avoid going back to smoking, beware of traumatic events. First time I went back was a medical trauma that had me crying for days. I decided that if I was going to have to stop crying, I needed a cigarette.  Second time was the universal trauma. The pandemic got me hard psychologically.

"Since my childhood, I have always questioned my destiny as to why my life has been the way it has been. Because of the frequent domestic violence I faced since my early childhood, it always felt within as if my very birth on this planet was unfair to me. Why did I have to go through all this? Somewhere it felt a deep mark within that one should not marry and if married, one should never bear children, because of the mental trauma that they might have to go through.

I always searched for these answers from someone or the other, read articles from spiritual Gurus from time to time. Because mind needs some logical reasoning to come out through that constant loop of thoughts and hence I kept searching for articles that could provide me solace from those thoughts.. Sometimes, when a quote was able to logically satisfy or console me, I would be calm that day or I can say I would be 'sane' that day, otherwise some thought or the other would always traumatise me. And it was really difficult to come out of it easily, and that would mean sleepless nights of anxiety, stress.

I mostly blamed my parents for the life I was going through.

One day I came across a quote by a famous spiritual guru named Osho, that said:
‚ÄúYou have to walk & create the way by your walking; you will not find a ready-made path. It is not cheap to reach to the ultimate realisation of truth.‚Äù

Another famous Guru, named Sadhhguru also said something on the same lines:
‚ÄúIf you realize your life is 100% your responsibility, there is no room for being resentful towards anyone.‚Äù

This helped me a lot in dealing with those thoughts though temporarily. But they sure did help.
most of them said the same thing, their words might be different but I guess the essence is the same. 

Now, it seems a little easier for me to remain stable and calm and not blame others for my destiny, because one thing that I have felt is when I take 100% responsibility for my life, be it joy, be it sorrow, it feels a lot lighter inside and I am able to focus on things that need to be done!

So I guess these quotes or these articles must be right. What do you all think ? Though my mind needs constant reminders in order to remain sane, but there is no denying that it does work!

Has anyone else experienced these loops of thoughts going on in mind like forever? How do you deal with them ? Anything that you found useful ?"	mansidhamija	post	25.08488650538635	male	White	0.0034341670107096434	na	na	na	10	selfhelp
"My recent comment history might be helpful.

It's about steppping out of the thoughts and being the observer, allowing thoughts-emotions to come and go. This breaks the thought-emotion loop which feeds each other. We essentially replace the thought part of the equation with awareness and then the emotion part starts to dissolve because it is no longer reinforced by thought.

Accepting responsibility for how we feel is essential as you have mentioned.

It's about not letting our awareness be swallowed by thoughts-emotions about past(memories)/future.

We keep practicing coming back to awareness, centering. This is a journey which takes intention, willingness, repetition, forgiveness, learning and retrying/practicing.

Awareness is not concentration. Awareness is. And we either cloud it with thought or we step back. Like clouds moving away and we see the sun. So awareness is the absence of doing something, it is not an activity like concentration.

With the intention and willingness to release destructive patterns we will catch ourselves indulging and then let go. We don't walk around concentrating on or breath or on a word to prevent ourselves from indulging in negativity (although these are not wrong and could be part of the journey). As we catch ourselves, let go, repeat and so on we gain momentum and start experiencing the changes. 

Maybe we meditate and then go through our day. We collect negativity. We meditate again and it is wiped clean. We notice it becomes easier not to collect negativity, to remain in non-judgemental awareness. Meditation then becomes something we are and not just an event that happens once a day (for example)."	mansidhamija	reply	na	na	na	0.0034341670107096434	no	no	no	na	selfhelp

"You will never be able to ""stop"" chatter but you can use distanced self-talk. This involves talking to yourself as if you were another person. For example, instead of saying ""I'm so stupid,"" you might say ""That was a stupid thing to do."" This can help you to see your thoughts from a different perspective and to detach yourself from them emotionally.

you can also mental distance by using visualization techniques. Imagine sitting in a comfortable chair, looking down at your thoughts as if they were written on paper. You can then choose to let go of the thoughts that are not helpful or productive.

">If you realize your life is 100% your responsibility, there is no room for being resentful towards anyone

To take that idea a bit further & refine it down a bit:

* **It's our job to manage our** ***consequences*** **in life** (because WE are the ones who are stuck with them, at the end of the day!)

That means:

* We are responsible for *our* actions
* We *aren't* responsible for everything that happens *to* us, because some actions (from other people, from nature, from different situations, and even from things that happen to our bodies, such as cancer) are outside of our control
* We *are* responsible for managing the consequences that we're stuck dealing with.  We are free to live in denial & make all of the excuses we want, but the bottom line is that at the end of the day, we are the only ones living with both what we've chosen to do AND what has happened to us!

Over the years, I've come to settle on this core concept as a driving force in my own life:

* **We get to choose our level of happiness in life**

One of the things that spurred this idea was a book by Holocaust survivor Victor Frankl, who wrote a book called ""Man's Search for Meaning"".  Here are a few of his quotes:

>‚ÄúEverything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one‚Äôs attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one‚Äôs own way.‚Äù  
>  
>‚ÄúWhen we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.‚Äù  
>  
>‚ÄúForces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation.‚Äù

Basically, we can *choose* to be happy & work on *being* happy *despite* our history & *despite* our present circumstances.  Another profoundly impactful book for me was ""Mindset"" by American psychologist Carol Dweck.  She teaches that in any given situation, we have the opportunity to adopt one of two mindsets:

1. A fixed mindset, which says ""I can't, and here's why""
2. A growth mindset, which says ""I can, and I will be persistent in finding a way, despite the inevitable obstacles I will face""

It's a more deeply functional version of ""where there's a will, there's a way!"" because:

1. It recognizes that life isn't monolithic & then we deal with multiple individual situations in life, each of which can be compartmentalized by each other.
2. It further recognizes that each compartmentalized situation can have a different mindset attached to it.
3. It gives us the freedom of choice for how we want to choose to think about each individual situation.

As Wayne Gretzky said, ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"", meaning that if we defeat ourselves first in our mind before we even get started, then we've *already* failed, by choice!  To me, I eventually came to accept that the first things I needed to do were:

1. Take full, personal responsibility for choosing my level of happiness in life, instead of letting circumstances or other people dictate it for me
2. In practice, that meant managing my consequences, including the ones I'm stuck with but didn't personally *choose* to have happen to me.

Once I got through the ""rite of passage"" of shifting my mindset over to ""not necessarily my *fault*, but definitely my *responsibility* to manage the cards I was dealt"", a whole WORLD of opportunities opened up for me!

I don't remember the name of the podcast, but they were talking about how to handle past trauma & other difficult historical situations, and the speaker said something that really resonated with me.  Essentially, it was the concept that while we can't change our past, we CAN change our *relationship* with those memories!

That was a surprisingly *astounding* concept to me, because there were some things I held onto with bitter anger about, things that flooded me with raw negative emotion, things that *controlled* me emotionally, things that *paralyzed* me temporarily.

"I'm also going to add that Osho and Sadhguru are not real gurus. To be qualified as a guru you should spend many years with a widely recognized and accepted guru, studying Vedas, meditating etc and if you're lucky you will get enlightened and then your guru might tell you that you can now become a guru. Neither Osho and Sadhguru did that, they are self proclaimed gurus and they're more like philosophers rather than gurus in its real sense. But they're popular in the West because their ""teachings"" are similar to what you will find in Western self help books and Western self help books are much better in that regard. But if it helps some people why not. If you listen to real gurus like Maharishi Mahesh Yogi then you will have hard time understanding what they're talking about because it's real Vedic spirituality.   

And also going back to your mind chatter, you can try not thinking at all. It's very hard to turn off your thoughts you can maybe do it for half a second or a couple of seconds but with practice you can do it for longer. It's really super beneficial on all levels. You can also try learning speedreading, it also helps you restructure how your brain works."	mansidhamija	reply	na	na	na	0.0034341670107096434	no	no	no	na	selfhelp
"A bit long but I think this comment is onto it. My mind would run all day/be on alert too much my whole life until recently. I began helping the Mind aspect of me by working on the Physical and Spiritual side, something about feeding each balances you out. Like a holy trinity of harmony. 

So physically I began taking nutrients I may be lacking (vitamin D, magnesium, etc) in combination with some relaxation nutrients like l theanine/lavander pill at bed time. I also began eating better, drinking more water, and being more physically active and stretching, stick to a routine, give it a week or 2 and you will be amazed. 

Spiritual side comes a bit more naturally, if you can meditate try for at least 10 min a day (meditate however you like that will make you just be actively calm in the present, that is the purpose), find designated time for reflection or for planning, it's easy in today's world to be thinking about either or and forget about the current moment. Read books or research knowledge, listen to podcasts or people with different views, learn. Keep your conscious curious. Help other people. 

And most importantly have a conversation with the most High, by prayer, nature, or through a focused meditation or truly however works for you, your connection to it is powerful. Finally pat yourself on the back. None of us have it truly figured it out here, but we are trying, and we will all reach what we seek somehow in one way or another so take it easy and keep working.

"part 2/2

>Since my childhood, I have always questioned my destiny as to why my life has been the way it has been. Because of the frequent domestic violence I faced since my early childhood, it always felt within as if my very birth on this planet was unfair to me. Why did I have to go through all this? Somewhere it felt a deep mark within that one should not marry and if married, one should never bear children, because of the mental trauma that they might have to go through.  
>  
>I always searched for these answers from someone or the other, read articles from spiritual Gurus from time to time. Because mind needs some logical reasoning to come out through that constant loop of thoughts and hence I kept searching for articles that could provide me solace from those thoughts.. Sometimes, when a quote was able to logically satisfy or console me, I would be calm that day or I can say I would be 'sane' that day, otherwise some thought or the other would always traumatise me. And it was really difficult to come out of it easily, and that would mean sleepless nights of anxiety, stress.  
>  
>I mostly blamed my parents for the life I was going through.

This sounds really difficult & I'm sorry you had to go through that!  Putting the information I learned above into practice here:

* You were a kid & didn't deserve the trauma you got
* It wasn't your fault, even if you were told it was; kids are kids & we behave like children
* One hard fact to accept is that there doesn't necessarily need to be a deeper meaning to it; **the reality is that some people are simply immature**, some people are hateful, and some people don't fully understand the consequences of their actions.  There's not necessarily a logical explanation behind it, as much as an *emotional* one: some adults are simply overgrown children, who can be abusive, through no fault of *you*.

Here's the reality:

* You deserve to create & enforce your own boundaries.  This also includes creating boundaries around *your* happiness to ensure that you're not letting the bad stuff in & not letting the bad stuff win!
* You deserve to treat yourself well.  This means engaging in consistent self-care, even things as simple as taking regular showers, as well as investing in yourself through hobbies, ongoing education, better jobs, good friends, etc.
* You deserve to be treated well, which means managing toxic relationships, whether it's a love interest, a boss, ""friends"", etc.

Somehow, everything has a silver lining.  It doesn't eliminate the bad stuff, but it does help to see it from another perspective sometimes:

* You've learned how you don't like to be treated
* You've learned how you don't want to treat other people
* You're not going to continue that cycle with family, friends, or strangers because you know *exactly* how getting mistreated feels.  Any future relationships you have, children you have, and so on are going to be treated in a way where they feel loved, valued, and cherished, because you *know* what's on the other end of that spectrum!

You can't change the past, but you CAN change your perspective on it, as well as decide on how much of your own personal happiness you want to be in charge of, which ultimately means being willing to manage our consequences, despite less-than-ideal circumstances!

It was hard, but I ultimately realized a big part of life really boils down to what we choose to focus on.  The world is a difficult place; it's easy to doomscroll all day.  Most people have some form of trauma in their personal life history; it can be really, *really* difficult to not let that saturate our daily existence, especially when it just feels like a raw bruise all day, every day!

What we CAN do is choose to focus on learning how to be happy, learning how to not change what already happened to us, but change how we look at it, and learning how to make a positive contribution to the world, including to our own lives!

>one thing that I have felt is when I take 100% responsibility for my life, be it joy, be it sorrow, it feels a lot lighter inside and I am able to focus on things that need to be done!

What you've achieved here is a level of personal responsibility & ownership that most people spend their whole lives struggling to achieve: circumstances can be good or bad, personal histories can be good or bad, but ultimately, we get to choose our level of happiness in life & we are responsible for managing our consequences, which is no small feat in practice!

I consider this an ongoing lifetime project...I'm not perfect at it & I'm not even very *good* at it, but at least I have a foundation of knowing how I really want to live my life!  It's so easy to coast through life, to blame other people & to blame our circumstances for our unhappiness, but at the end of the day, the only ones who are getting cankered by that anger is ourselves!

That's not easy to accept; it pretty much took me well into adulthood to accept that fact that no one was coming to rescue me, so I had to rescue myself!  How amazing of a life we have is pretty much entirely dependent on our ability to focus on making a positive contribution to the world, which includes learning how to be happy in our life, DESPITE the difficult circumstances we've each individually experienced growing up!

Hang in there!  It may not feel like it & it may not be easy, but you're on EXACTLY the right path for personal growth & for finding happiness in your own life!"	mansidhamija	reply	na	na	na	0.0034341670107096434	no	strong	no	na	selfhelp

"Hey OP, 

I'm sorry that you are going through a tough time. First and foremost, I truly believe that therapy is a starting step (if you can afford it) to explore the root of your depression and other mental health that you have. 

There are two books that greatly improved my social skills. Please know that what you learn from the books is what you need to apply to your day to day life. Try to focus on small wins (i.e. having a 5 minutes conversation with a stranger is a huge accomplishment).  Then, use these small wins as a way to develop your self-confidence. 

1) Improve your Social Skills by Daniel Wendler: the author himself grew up to be bullied, harassed and excluded. Later in his life, he found out that he has Asperger's Syndrome. Wendler made an excellent point that social skills CAN BE LEARNED.

2) Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People by Vanessa Van Edwards: the author herself was socially awkward and even hid in the girls' bathroom during school. Eventually, she grew out of it as she made her life mission to improve social skills in networking, meeting new people, and dating. Van Edwards taught me how to speed-read people quite easily based on a single social interaction.

BONUS: I suffered from anxiety, so I read a book called ""Chatter"" by Ethan Kross who gave me the tools to manage my anxiety and my overthinking. You may find it helpful.  


Try finding these books at your local library. Hope that this helps you, OP."	Open_Discount_683	reply	na	na	na	0.994176983833313	strong	no	no	na	selfhelp

"Backstory - I'm a full time working mom with a 13 month old and another baby on the way. I've been struggling to have energy but am trying to be ""on"" at work, home and exercise every day. Husband works really long hours so I'm in charge of the morning routine, drop-off and pickup and am the only one at home usually until bedtime.

I feel like lately I can't do anything right. I'm fatigued so my work is slipping. I don't have much energy for my kid. Over the weekend, my husband called me a terrible mom in the heat of an argument (he apologized profusely later and has told me he really does think I'm a good mom but I can't shake that comment). And today to top it off, I hit a parked car at work (don't worry, I left my contact info and insurance).

"Hey I'm Joseph, age 17(M). I'm kind of doing this as a last resort because my chronic GAD doesn't let me to open up because of social embarrassment which is why I'm doing this on an alt. If you are courteous enough to read and respond to this the best you can then thank you so much. Any input is appreciated. The main goal is to put this in the public sphere just to see what people think and maybe help me gain a new perspective on myself, my future and long term happiness.

For the first half of my life it was pretty model. Young kid, two parents, suburban home, brother, that stuff. Until I noticed that as I got older the kids around me got meaner and meaner. Only it wasn't them getting meaner, but rather me getting easier to bully as I was fat for the majority of my life and pretty much everyone around me would constantly make fun of me for years and years. They would openly joke about how I was only around to make fun of. And if those were my friends than you sure wouldn't want to know about my bullies. Pretty much everyday I would get harassed by a group of kids at school(physically assaulted, verbally humiliated, have my property fucked with or stolen, cyberbullied.) 

This went on for years and years, and worst part about it is that I never did anything about it other than take it home with me and attack my family. I started acting out at home which resulted in police and a collude of traumatizing incidents that I don't want to talk about.  I remember at being such a low point that while I faked calling in sick so I didn't have to go to school, I got a rope and tried to hang myself in my bedroom closet. In fact I had used 14 out of the 14 sick days that you could use before you missed so much school, you had to repeat the grade. Just when I simply couldn't take it anymore, covid hit, and now I was at home safe or so I had thought.

During all of this I managed to keep my grades all A's, but when the covid stay at home order happened, something in me just cracked. It was as if my brain had realized that now that I had escaped, it would never let me back in the outside world again. I became extremely anxious and developed GAD, OCD, Depression and PTSD(all diagnosed) and completely imploded on myself. For a year my mental illness couldn't let me focus in school and instead of focusing on healing myself, I opted for short term dopamine drips to keep myself from committing suicide. this went on until I had learned that next year I would have to go back to school in person and go through that hell again but only with a new cast at high school. I couldn't bare it. I cut off myself from everyone I knew, my weight skyrocketed and I was now obese, and I quit my prestigious high school that I worked so hard to get into for and online course that I would neglect, along with myself and what I needed for the next two years.

For these two years, I couldn't care less about anything other than thinking about all the mistakes of my past and drowning them out with food, videogames, beating my meat, and anything else you could imagine to waste time. I did literally nothing but ponder where it all went wrong and curse the world for hurting me waiting for it to give me something in return. Sadly but thankfully, it would take me these two years to realize that the world wasn't going to help me and that if I was going to get out of this hole, I would have to get out myself. It is now six months after this two year spat, and  I'm still anxious, lonely, and depressed, but I have made changes to help myself. I no longer play video games as they are a waste of time for me and never did me any good, I've now lost around 55 pounds and put on muscle by working out 6 days a week(kinda have a physique,) cold plunge in 40 degree water everyday, I'm on antidepressants, and I'm no longer neglecting my schooling and plan to finish my junior year by the end of the summer. 

Personally, I think it was my father's absence from my life. I literally had no voice of reason, nobody to tell me to toughen up, to be behind me and help me get back on course if I went off. I have a father but for all of my life, the only thing he has ever been to me is a chauffer and a donor. Both his children(me and my brother) have bad mental illness stemming from not being able to be assertive and strong. Whenever confronted with this, he rolls his eyes and talks about it all being 100% genetics and how he had something similar. I know for a fact the reason I have what I have isn't genetics. Its a fucked up lie used to obscure himself from responsibility.

I feel my life is at a crossroads. I think I've missed so much life because of this. Never had a high school life, girlfriend, drivers license, or any sense of social security. I'm extremely insecure about myself and my future and I could really use some advice on what to do next.

"I spent last Tuesday and Wednesday staring at a project proposal, and despite the deadlines looming, it was like trying to read it through a thick fog.

By the end of day two, out of pure frustration, I decided to figure out why it felt like my brain had turned to mush.

Here's what I dug up about why we sometimes feel like a computer that needs a hard reset:

1‚Äî **Fatigue:** Honestly, I probably needed more sleep, because fatigue = brain fog.

2‚Äî **Neurodivergence:** Some folks, especially those with conditions like ADHD, might face extra hurdles when it comes to distractions.

3‚Äî **Multitasking:** I had about 23 tabs open... need I say more?

4‚Äî **Stress and Overwhelm:** Too many tasks? Brain goes ""Nope!""

5‚Äî **Unenjoyable Tasks:** Let's be real, some projects are like pulling teeth.

6‚Äî **Poor Time Management:** My mortal enemy. A poorly planned day can lead to zero progress.

And while spiraling down this research rabbit hole, I found some nifty advice on how to snap back into focus:

1- **SMART Goals**: Breaking down the beast into bite-sized pieces.

2- **Remove Distractions**: Clean workspace, fewer notifications, more peace. I use Sunsama's Focus Mode to avoid getting distracted.

3- **Focus on High-Impact Work**: Which tasks will yield the most results? Again, I use Sunsama to order my tasks from high to low priority and tackle each one by one.

4- **Know Your Productive Times**: I've realized post-lunch hours are NOT my prime time.

5- **Stay Healthy**: Decent sleep, not living off coffee, and maybe some fresh air.

6- **Be Mindful**: Taking a moment to just breathe and be in the present. Easier said than done, but worth a shot.

"A lot of brain fog could just be literal health related things like mild dehydration. Proper hydration and electrolyte intake is crucial. But also adequate vitamin d, because you cant process magnesium and calcium without it.But also drinking too close to bed makes your sleep poor cuz you gotta pee.

Also a sleep tracking smart watch can monitor sleep quality. A lot of people have undiagnosed sleep apnea, which is the biggest cause of brain fog.

"I do get brain fog when I am in the depressed side of bipolar. But it is not a two day event, it can extend for months.

What I do to keep myself out of depression or mania is very similar to the points you made. The other commenter who said it might be physical health related also has a good point. 

I would just add: 

1 Eat a ton of vegetables. They can help your bowel work and give you the vitamins you need. The 5 portions a day they recommend in the uk is a good place to start. 

2 Exercise at least twice a week. This changes according to your fitness level. Can be from a 20 minute walk to an hour at the gym. My walk to work is 20 min each way, so that for me is too little.

A lot of self-help books are very repetitive and formulaic. I think self improvement needs to come from a deeper place, and these books help you get there. Also, biographies and memoirs are great.

Hi, I‚Äôm Aiden. I‚Äôm 14 and I‚Äôm going to a technical high school. I have ADD and I don‚Äôt like how I look, I need to get my screen time down but I have nothing to do. I need stuff to do, I read before camp but after a one week sleep away camp with no electronics I lost my reading habits and screen time management habits. When I have nothing to do I do impulsive eating. I have around 9 hours a day on my phone and I am playing soccer in high school, it‚Äôs a smaller school so I‚Äôm going to play goalie and I meet with a coach twice a week. He helps me with fitness and stuff. I need to do push-ups but I can‚Äôt support my body weight. Someone help, also I need to loose weight and find a morning routine that works, my bus will come at 6:30 AM and I need a morning routine for that. Can someone give me tips I hate how I look and my head is huge. School starts aug 31 and I need a workout plan for every day till then. Thanks so much! :)	Additional_Prune4637	post	20.79220584862457	female	White	0.006164055783301592	na	na	na	2	selfhelp
"A lot of people with ADD use alarms to manage their time. You could set alarms for exercise, for reading, for getting off screentime. It may be hard at first to be bored, but try to stick to it. You'll get used to the new routine.

As for not liking your looks... that's a common sentiment in teens. Try to find things you do like about yourself, and focus on that. With time you'll hopefully become more comfortable in your skin. And with exercising regularly you should gain confidence there too.

Sorry I don't have exercise tips. But I think it's cool that you're trying to take better care of yourself. Those are really important habits and skills.

Good luck!"	Additional_Prune4637	reply	na	na	na	0.006164055783301592	no	no	no	na	selfhelp
Decrease your caloric intake (so be on a caloric deficit) and increase your cardio. Start with the treadmill, and slowly start increasing your speed and overall time on it. Once you feel pretty comfortable on the treadmill, start running a mile or two outside. Then, work on your mile time or increase your distance.

"i know everyone here already told me to work on my self, improve my self.. find a hobby trust me i tried finding a hobby its not impossible but its really hard and im trying my hardest , or find a therapist thats impossible too, im meditating and exercising but these get boring at home

some said to stop comparing myself with others and be kind to my self and do what i like to do which is basically almost nothing some said to love my self more

some said to go out more and im doing that too, some said do things im afraid of well im doing these too. 

i wanna do the work, do the work to change my personality but what work? change the way i think? change my behavior? 

i read, watch shows, read about history, astronomy, psychology, philosophical
listen to music, I work, i study, i used to play soccer but dont have a team anymore..
yesterday i went swimming and i kinda learnt to swim and i enjoyed it a lot but the place is like 4kms away. 

i really want to experience more life and stop being a people pleasing loser who is always the one texting first, texting more, way more invested than the girl, its not the girls fault.. 1 out of 10 girls reply and that girl usually says not interested

i don't know how to get interested in these girls, how to keep convos going, its always me talking more and i feel like im desperate when i send long messages and get one word replies back

im jealous of guys who girls chase after or talk to or have long conversations with in which both sides contribute, but with me i feel like its always me contributing, maybe subconsciously i feel like im not good enough therefore i don't really want to contribute? or what am contributing is not good enough? or i dont want to contribute and im just afraid of being alone so i try my hardest? 

sometimes i say things that i think is what others want to hear, sometimes i say things that i feel like i want to say both really dont get any replies or get anyone's attention That's why i feel like dont say anything interesting or worthwhile.

i try to think of smart, interesting, cool, funny things to say but i cant say any, i hate that im always trying so damn hard just to make a friend, idek why i care so much

i don't think anyone wants to pay attention to me or care about me or love me or likes me or be interested in me. i feel like im annoying and its really hard to like me

i guess i have to be happy alone before anything. 
im telling my self what would a best friend tell me? and i do those. wether sitting up right, walking without my head down

i don't want to chase after people at the same time i dont want to keep being alone

i dont want to be desperate or needy or chasing approval or attention anymore, its just sickening and i hate doing it, 

im 21 and im a virgin, dating mostly not allowed in where i live you have to get married to talk to girls face to face, mostly just text and that's how they get married. 

people way younger than me have gotten married, im tired of porn and texting girls onlie be my only goal

i think i use the texting to prove to my self that im cool, funny, smart, charismatic, confident

i have actually no idea what to even talk about, i have no idea how to make friends, i have 0, i dont know how to act.

i been people pleasing so much, outside of people pleasing behaviors I dont know how to act, recently i been saying way less, i don't try to force conversations or ask a ton of questions

im trying to improve in social skills. i deleted all my social medias permanently, insta, snap, discord, fb 

i realize that spending all that time texting like a thousand girls is a waste of time. sometimes i would spam weird open liners to random girls around the world..i know that's dumb/not a good way to spend my time, i know time is limited and i should spend it doing more productive things like learning a skill.

im learning car mechanics, coding and amor language i want to learn more but also have fun doing it"	Butcher__1	post	14.938701419635041	male	White	0.9982319474220276	na	na	na	4	selfhelp
"First of all, you seem like a very smart young man from what I'm reading.  
And people pleasing is just a sign that you really care about people and that you're genuine about it which it awesome.

Let's start by focusing on what's great about you.

Have you ever heard of something called the backwards law?

It basically states that in some areas of your life, like making friends and finding a partner, the harder you try the farther you get from the thing you want.

Smart people like you tend to try harder or find a smarter way of going about it because it's what's worked for you in other areas of your life. I know because I'm the same, I was also a virgin at 21 even though I could date girls in my country, imagine that...

But in order to change that, you need to become someone who other people want to spend time with. By this, I don't mean you should become someone you're not, in fact I mean the opposite, become more of you.

Do more of the things you enjoy, keep swimming if you like it, who cares how far it is. Start a soccer team, and keep learning but take in-person classes, not online.

By doing these things you will naturally meet other people with similar interests and make friends, and when it comes to girls think about this...

If you were a girl, how you like to be talked to?

Hope this helps."	Butcher__1	reply	na	na	na	0.9982319474220276	weak	no	no	na	selfhelp

relieving yourself is healthy but not multiple times a day. according to google, in order for a man to maintain a healthy prostate, relieving yourself once a day should be sufficient and is not considered an addiction, however you could be undiagnosed adhd and searching for natural dopamine. it‚Äôs a chemical imbalance where your brain doesn‚Äôt produce enough dopamine so adhd people are more susceptible to porn addictions, substance abuse, eating disorders, etc. i recommend finding a therapist to help you unload all of your guilt since it can be suffocating at times. feeling validated and safe is step one to improving yourself. Distract yourself when you feel the urge to relieve yourself by going on a walk, going to talk to someone, face time a friend, read a book, etc retraining your brain to do something that give you dopamine that isn‚Äôt destructive is important. taking cold showers, eating a piece of chocolate, working out, all of these things give you a natural high. also try natural supplements (with the approval of a doctor) like lions mane, lavender, ashwaganda, magnesium, saffron, and B12 and vitamin D	Butcher__1	reply	na	na	na	0.9982319474220276	no	no	no	na	selfhelp
"You cannot change your personality. That is the most basic part of your emotional self.

Texting girls you dont know sounds like a scammer to me. If I guy texted some one liner from across the globe, I would block him immediately - too similar to Nigerian love scam for comfort. Not that I am pretty or a girl anymore, but still. This might be part of your lack of success in this approach. 

My take on making friends is to have places you go - in the real world - with regularity that have other people who like the same things you like. Look for classes on the things you like - and they are many, kudos - and sign up. Go there and be yourself. If you try to change the way you are you are going to sound forced an fake.

"As an introvert myself, I can honestly say, yes it can get that bad. Can't tell you how many times I just got total full-blown anxiety over having to talk to someone to get something I wanted. If you could do EVERYTHING online I would have never left my house as a teenager.

And yes it's tough...

Most people don't get that, but I do. I hear you.  
It's very tough to have that level of anxiety over something that seems like nothing to other people. While you feel like the weight of the world is coming over you and nobody seems to care or notice.

But the good news is, it can get easier. It did for me and it will definitely happen for you too.

Now, my advice for you is probably something you're not going to like, but it will help, I guarantee it. 

Before you go to your grandma's ask yourself this question:  
How can I enjoy this, how can I make this much more of a pleasing experience?

Maybe have a dance party with the dogs and cats, take some earplugs so they don't wake you up, or work on something you love like dancing, writing, reading, drawing, painting, you name it. Get creative with what you can eat while you're there lol.

Fapping [downregulates](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12689608/) these receptors and [upregulates](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17239879/) estrogen receptors in the brain, making you more submissive over time.

"I used to have many misunderstandings about surrendering. It felt like giving up or not pushing hard enough. But recently, I stumbled upon the book ""The Surrender Experiment,"" and it completely changed my perspective. Surrendering, it turns out, is the exact opposite of what I thought.¬†

&#x200B;

What truly inspired me in the book was the author's decision to embrace new experiences, even those he initially resisted. He chose to surrender and be open to life's opportunities, and the results were far beyond his imagination. That, to me, is the genuine essence of surrendering. **It doesn't mean giving up on life; instead, it's about releasing our ego and personal preferences, facing our fears, and having the courage to step outside our comfort zone. It's about relinquishing control and wholeheartedly embracing whatever life presents us with.**

&#x200B;

Looking back on my own life, I realized that most of my successes came from confronting these challenges head-on, while most of my suffering arose when I clung to comfort based on personal preferences. Now, having experienced this breakthrough, I've made the most crucial decision of my life: to surrender. I am choosing to participate in life with a calm mind and an open heart.

&#x200B;

A calm mind entails letting go of constant self-analysis, personal preferences, and ego-driven thoughts. So much of our suffering comes from obsessing about ourselves. However, if we shift our focus to serving others and let go of our own desires, we can find instant relief. The happiest people in the world are not those who achieve greatness solely for themselves, but those who enrich the lives of others. Surrendering allows life to grant us gifts beyond our wildest dreams.

&#x200B;

An open heart means being open-minded, flexible, and courageous. It may sound simple, but it's a challenging endeavor. Confronting our fears and being willing to do things we initially resist are significant parts of this process. **Sometimes, the most remarkable outcomes come from things we never wanted or considered in the first place.** So, if you're considering surrendering, start by addressing your fears. Instead of avoiding them, confront them and take on the tasks you don't want to do. This is the path to surrendering to life.

&#x200B;

When we take greater risks, we also reap greater rewards. As we do this, it's essential to quiet our minds. This means letting go of judgments and opinions and creating mental clarity to see things as they are without overanalyzing. To start, pay close attention to your thoughts and become aware of them. Whenever you catch yourself engrossed in a negative thought, pause, take a breath, and acknowledge that it's just your mind spinning a tale‚Äîit doesn't come from your heart. Let it go and refocus on the task at hand. Surrendering is not a one-time event; it is a continuous process of growth and self-discovery. So, be patient with yourself and celebrate every step forward, no matter how small it may seem.

&#x200B;

In the end, surrendering is about finding harmony within ourselves and with the world around us. It is about aligning with the natural rhythms of life and trusting that the universe has our best interests at heart. So, let go of the need for control, quiet your mind, and embrace the beauty of surrender. As you do so, you will unlock the door to a life of fulfillment, purpose, and boundless possibilities.

That's a great point! The essence of service lies in your intentions. Ask yourself, why do you wish to serve others? Is it driven by a genuine desire to help, support, and enrich their lives, or does it stem from seeking to fill a void within yourself?

"She  constantly blames me for being vulnerable and crying, insisting that  I'm oversensitive, rude, and not allowed to express my emotions freely.  This has caused me to put my emotions on autopilot, hiding them even  from myself, and convincing myself that I'm just too sensitive. Whenever  I try to address her behavior, she gaslights me, deflects the issue,  and scolds me for no apparent reason. If I stand up to her, she  dismisses me as a rude child, leaving me feeling silenced and unable to  express myself.

Her consistent low  opinion of me deeply hurts, leading to a significant blow to my  self-esteem. Subconsciously, I'm terrified of making even the slightest  mistake, as I know she'll demean me, calling me an idiot who can't do  anything right. She communicates with unclear expectations, expecting me  to understand without her needing to say anything, making me feel like a  constant disappointment to her. Her anger can be so intense that it  breaks my heart and leaves me feeling emotionally numb.

However,  amidst all the negativity, I can't deny that she cares about me in her  own way. She cooks my favorite meals and offers advice to reduce stress  when I study. But, she becomes disappointed if my grades aren't perfect,  even though I am actually an honored student. She takes care of me  physically, but emotionally, her words can be cruel, especially when she  mocks my passion for singing.

Approval  from her is a constant need in my life. Her words can be incredibly  cutting, as she keeps bringing up my past mistakes and refuses to  believe in me or have faith in my abilities. The rare moments of pride  she shows are when I achieve something notable, but she tends to  prioritize sharing these achievements on social media rather than  expressing her joy directly to me.

It's  a typical Asian mom situation, and feeling particularly down today, I  decided to pour out my feelings while sobbing quietly in my room.  Writing this has helped me feel somewhat better.

And what hurts the most is that she doesn't believe in me .She's not faithful in me ."	Who_1111	post	16.462269112928112	female	White	0.9959157109260559	na	na	na	6	selfhelp
"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult and emotionally challenging situation with your mother. It sounds like you are experiencing a lot of hurt, frustration, and emotional turmoil as a result of her behavior and attitude toward you. It's essential to remember that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to express emotions and be vulnerable.

Dealing with a parent who is unsupportive and critical can be extremely tough and damaging to one's self-esteem and emotional well-being. It seems like you're experiencing gaslighting, emotional manipulation, and a lack of emotional validation from your mother. This can be especially damaging because it affects the way you perceive yourself and impacts your ability to express and process emotions in a healthy manner. However, most parents don't do this on purpose. Most likely they themselves grow up in an environment, where such behavior was the norm. As such, it is very difficult to give you something (emotional support) that they are missing themselves.

If you find it helpful, here is a supportive story for you: In the depths of a dense forest stands a towering tree, its branches laden with emotions like leaves swaying in the wind. But there's a constant storm in this forest, and the tree finds itself constantly battered by harsh gusts. The tempest takes the form of a relentless critic, a fierce gust of wind that strips the leaves from the branches. This critic, a stormy figure, refuses to acknowledge the tree's vulnerability, dismissing it as merely a fragile sapling unfit for this wilderness.

As the tree weathers this emotional storm, it learns to cloak its emotions in an invisible canopy, hiding them even from itself. It believes the critic's harsh words, branding itself as too sensitive, and unworthy of expressing feelings freely. Each time the tree tries to confront the storm, the gusts become fiercer, deflecting its efforts like a gusty whirlwind. The storm scolds the tree without reason, leaving it silenced and unable to sway with its natural emotions.

Within the forest's heart, the tree's self-esteem lies wounded, like roots tangled in rocky soil. Fear grows like vines, spreading its tendrils throughout the tree's core. It dreads making even the slightest mistake, for the storm will howl with fury, calling the tree an incompetent being, unable to stand tall and firm.

Yet, amidst this tumultuous forest, the tree can't deny the storm's moments of care. Occasionally, the storm will offer a gentle breeze, cooking the tree's favorite meals and offering advice to alleviate stress during its growth. But this cyclone carries an expectation of perfection, and if the tree's growth falters even slightly, it faces a torrent of disappointment from the storm.

The tree's songs echo through the woods, a harmonious melody that resonates with its soul. Yet, the storm unleashes thunderous criticism, mocking the tree's passion for singing. It shatters the notes, leaving the tree's heart in pieces and emotions numbed like frozen sap.

Seeking the storm's approval has become an insatiable need in the tree's life. Its words carve deep wounds, continuously reopening past scars and refusing to nurture faith in the tree's potential. Rare beams of pride pierce the canopy when the tree achieves something remarkable, but the storm prioritizes showcasing these accomplishments to others rather than whispering words of encouragement directly.

In this forest of life, the tree yearns for the storm to believe in its growth and potential. Yet, the storm's faith wavers like a flickering flame, leaving the tree shrouded in doubt.

Though the tree stands in this challenging forest, it's crucial to remember that it isn't alone. In the shadows, there are fellow trees, friends who can offer support and understanding. And even in the darkest moments, a guiding light may emerge‚Äîa wise owl or a gentle sunbeam‚Äîto provide solace and show the tree that it is worthy of love and acceptance.

The tree must learn to draw strength from its roots, anchoring itself firmly in its own worth, even when the storm's gusts howl relentlessly. And as it continues to grow, it may find that its branches extend high above the canopy, reaching for the stars, untethered by the storm's critical gaze. The tree will discover its own melody, singing a song of resilience, courage, and self-compassion, regardless of the storm's turbulent presence.

"I'm sorry you're going through that, but I'm happy that you have enough self awareness and situational awareness to see the unhealthy dynamic that's playing out. Good for you for standing up for yourself.

You're stuck in a real difficult spot, because it's very very tough to improve a relationship like that where the other person straight up tells you that you don't have a right to *have feelings about things.* If her response is, ""it's your fault for being too sensitive,"" then she's just not giving you much to work with.

If sounds like you're in school, so you're probably just going to have to make the best of a non-great situation until you're old enough to move out on your own. You can love her, and you can recognize that she loves you, but you need to resign yourself to the fact that there are certain kinds of support and understanding that you're simply never going to get from your mom. If she shows willingness to grow and work with you - that's a different story. But that's not really what I'm hearing.

Do your best to surround yourself with friends and other family members who provide the emotional support that your mom doesn't seem able or willing to give.

"I understand what you are going through. I have been through the same. 

I wished I could get my mom to love me, to be proud of me. She is not able to do that. She would want my company - it could have been anyone, she really just didn't want to watch TV alone. She wanted me to dress like a whore and be a virgin, worst still, dismiss me when I complained about getting harassed on the street and groped on buses while being an underage teenager. 

I am almost 50 years old now and I still get angry because I deserved better. 

How does this apply to you? There is no solving a problem that is not yours. You cant fix your mom, you can just lower your expectations. You can change how you respond to her, stop trying to get what you deserve, but wont get. You can leave as soon as you can and move on with your life. Therapy would help greatly, if you can get it. 

I am so sorry you are going through this. If it helps, here goes: I see you. You are a person who deserves all that you say you want. You should get it. It is a disaster that your mom cant give it to you."	Who_1111	reply	na	na	na	0.9959157109260559	weak	strong	no	na	selfhelp

"anytime i see a couple or friends talking having fun or laughing my mind immediately goes to roasting myself for not being that cool or funny or smart 

i tell my self that everyone is different, everyone has problems, and i shouldn't compare my self to anyone 


and i immediately think that no one likes me or loves me or wants to talk to me or cares about me to even have a conversation

then i get reminded of everytime that girls have replied to me with one words while i said a ton

probably because what i said wasn't that interesting. 

before anytime i talk i try to think of things to say that are interesting, cool, funny, smart but i got nothing. 

i hate being the ""Boring unlikeable nice guy who is passive or aggressive"" 

everyday i write these journals, and everyday i try to fight the negative thoughts, trying to change my people pleasing habits

for past week i been doing everything that scares the hell outta me. or makes me uncomfortable even though its to my advantage

if you look back at my every post does my problem go back to self esteem? 

comparison, people pleasing, boring personality, no friends, overthinking, desperate, needy

I think i look to have fun by getting others approval/attention. i know thats not the way.

today i told my self to not look for external validation, i need internal validation but u don't know where to look. 

i study, i work, i exercise, mediate, watch shows, listen to music, stargaze or dive deep into astronomy online, or watch documentaries, or go for walks, past 2 days i been trying to create a documentary and post it on YouTube, im learning another language and coding for college, trying to learn Muay Thai from my phone,

 because i live in iraq and finding fun classes or hobbies is hard af. im in a middle of big city right now. i even looked on google maps to find fun places to do things alone and i couldn't find any. 
only physical hobby i have is soccer but cant play because broken leg 2 months ago 


but i want to achieve something bigger or at least more fun, im tired of having porn and texting by my only goals but finding an alternative is hard especially when i been addicted to these for years. 

i deleted my social medias permanently and challenged my self to not fap or look at porn for a month to see what happens.

i know ""Self improvement"" cant be my only life goal and there needs to be some balance and have fun too or do something meaningful thats not beneficial to me in any way"	Butcher__1	post	18.48879886274257	male	White	0.9957237243652344	na	na	na	1	selfhelp
You already doing really well, I‚Äôm proud of you and what you do! Maybe you are just in a rut. Or maybe you are forcing it to hard and not allowing yourself to enjoy things organically. Having positive relationships with others definitely makes you feel good and I totally understand your struggle with the people pleasing. Maybe you just need to find the right people. Allow yourself some guilty pleasures as well. I think it‚Äôs also an act of self love to just let yourself enjoy something stupid sometimes. It doesn‚Äôt have to be hard discipline all day everyday.

"I always had the feeling I was the kind of person who takes relationships very seriously, even though I've never actually been in one. When I was depressed and voiced my concerns about being single and having trouble with finding love, people always told me I had to stop trying to find a partner and work on myself instead. All that self-love and self-improvement kind of talk, pretty much. Of course I listened and did just that, because I realised that I was unwell and clearly unfit for a relationship anyhow.

Fast forward to now, I'm doing all those things people told me to do when I was depressed. I started going to therapy,  began healing my emotional scars and learning to love myself, I found healthier and more enjoyable hobbies, I started volunteering to find fulfillment, I try meeting new people and making more connections. All in all, a big improvement and I'm content with where I am now.

Thing is, I still feel like something is missing in my life. I get it, you can't be happy 100% of the time and life naturally has its ups and downs, so you can't expect to be perfectly happy just because you're no longer depressed. But still, despite my life being much better than it used to be, I still feel like it's just underwhelming somehow. It appears to me that the only thing that I am indeed lacking is an intimate relationship, so I started working on pursuing that.

And that's when I realised just how unhappy I actually was. I realised that I was distracting myself with other things such as my career or hobbies or friends, and didn't really bother thinking about finding a partner because I felt like I wasn't ready. But now that I am ready, and am confronted with wanting to look for someone now, I can't help but worry about how much this is affecting my mood.

Not sure how to formulate what exactly I want help with, but decided to just make this post and see if anyone has anything to say."	qpd17706	post	16.741623765689557	male	White	0.002442931290715933	na	na	na	4	selfhelp
"I just saw a post similar to this 

https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/15cn6jo/is_it_true_that_sone_us_will_never_have_a_person/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1

The only thing people will tell you is to be patient and to work on yourself. The law of attraction states that you will attract in your life whatever you focus on. From reading your post, I can assume you have a negative mindset surrounding relationships (you say you‚Äôve never been in one / feel like something is missing in your life which makes you unhappy.) To explain a little deeper, i am not saying you are a negative person. But having a negative mindset towards a certain situation, you think negative thoughts like ‚ÄúI will never find someone‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am unhappy being single‚Äù, ‚ÄúI just want someone‚Äù etc, if you are in a state of WANT you do not HAVE. Start slow, just begin to change your mindset. ‚ÄúI will find someone one day‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am okay being single for now‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need someone to fulfill my happiness‚Äù if you want to be a magnet and attract love then this has to be your mindset! 

In the thread i linked above I mentioned how I swore off men after getting constantly cheated on, i unknowingly became a magnet, because I wasn‚Äôt thinking from a place of lack I would think ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a man‚Äù ‚ÄúI am done chasing‚Äù (which I put myself through so much I physically / mentally couldn‚Äôt care less if I ever got into another relationship) I found comfort in being alone. It‚Äôs a lot easier said when you have the experience of relationships, which I know you said you haven‚Äôt been in one, so it can seem difficult to you. I could argue that you are lucky, being in the WRONG relationship has taken years off my life with the constant betrayal/ abuse. You don‚Äôt need anyone to complete you, you were born alone and you will die alone. I think you have to be comfortable with that before you are able to attract a healthy relationship. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with wanting something, but don‚Äôt want from an empty cup!

"This is actually something I've been working on as well, even in therapy, just not specifically in regards to relationships/ dating. For instance, I stopped taking shit from people and accepted myself for who I truly was, and was able to meet friends I genuinely connect with that way.

But I'm currently having some trouble applying a similar mindset regarding relationships, I think mainly because it's indeed something I have no experience with and so it's just something completely new to me and it's hard to get into the flow of things, so to say.

I try to be optimistic but there is definitely a tiny seed of doubt in the back of my mind that says I might never find a partner, because in my mind it's purely arbitrary and if luck doesn't smile my way it's just not gonna work out. Meeting people to be friends with is easy because it doesn't require quite as much chemistry as a relationship does.

I realise that I don't really ""need"" someone else in order to be happy, but I do believe that there is an inherent human desire for intimacy. And in a way, isn't that basically the same thing as needing someone else for happiness?"	qpd17706	follow-up	na	na	na	0.002442931290715933	no	strong	no	na	selfhelp

"Thanks for sharing.

To answer your question though, I actually did have a particular interest in my best friend for a while. I talked to them about it but they didn't have the same feelings. We still remained best friends and didn't impede our friendship at all. And it made me realise that I have this kind of emotionally intimate relationship established with someone already, just that it's platonic. I'm happy about that but I still do have that unmet desire for some physical intimacy as well.

So I'll definitely just continue meeting new people, making new friends and seeing if I end up liking any of them to want to enter a relationship with them. It's just this uncertainty, not knowing when or even if I'll find someone like this again, that is bothering me at the moment."	qpd17706	follow-up	na	na	na	0.002442931290715933	weak	strong	no	na	selfhelp

"Things aren't going great.

Money problems, car problems, job problems, family problems, childcare problems, health problems, interpersonal problems, mental health problems, housing problems.

The actual laundry list of things doesn't matter. It's just always *something,* usually twelve somethings going on at the same time, and it never stops, and it never slows down, and I'm starting to fall apart.

I'm overwhelmed. I'm drinking more and more. I'm not sleeping. My hairline is receding faster, my beard is going gray at 37, and my chest hurts a little bit, all the time.

The big thing is *control*. I have none. People say focus on the things you can control, but I'm drawing a blank. *Nothing* seems to be within my control. Things just happen, and keep happening, and keep happening, and there seems to be nothing I can do about any of it. It's just one damn crisis after another, and all I can do is cope as best I can on a case-by-case basis. Every day, at any moment, some new crisis is waiting around the corner and I never know what it is or when it's going to happen but I know I'm probably gonna have to ask my mom for money, and it will be humiliating, and thats the best-case scenario.

I'm tired of it. I'm so tired of feeling so small and poor and powerless. I'm tired of being pushed around by events, by other people, by the impersonal forces of the world. I just want a little bit of agency, a little bit of dignity, a little bit of *power* over *something*, ***anything***, please God, just one area of my life where I'm secure and in charge, where what I want matters, where I don't have to ask permission or beg for money, where I don't have to worry about the rug being pulled out from under me at any moment...

Sounds like the first and fundamental thing is self-care. I too have a bunch of circumstance problems that stress me out and trigger me. I have to meditate, exercise, use out-breathing to calm myself amid the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. In your case, for example, that could mean exercise instead of drink to improve your sleep. Start with your own body and mind. Then you're more prepared to tackle the world.

"That was about financial management. 

It's about your self care.

Whenever you have no control over anything in your life. 
Start meditation and let your feelings and emotions go without any control.


Means, don't try to control your feelings. If your mind reminds you of something, let it do.

Free your mind and don't control it. Let it be free like you've never done before.

If something happens, let them happen, don't control it. 
Accept each and everything whatever is in your mind. Don't run away from your emotions. Let your emotions flow without any control.

Forget the society, forget about your so-called fake respects, forget the consequences.Your focus must be on your mental peace. 

Death is the last thing which happens. Until your death, there are no other consequences which stop you from being a better person. 

Don't allow anything which comes in the way of your feelings and emotions. 

When it is finished, Write your plan on paper and put all your efforts into your plan. 
Make a rule of your life, 'You will touch alcohol only when you're so happy."" and stick to it.

"Hi
I just want for someone to listen. I can't control my weight and I don't know what I'm doing wrong

After starting to again work out regularly I decided to weight in myself today and I was mortified - 69,2 kg even though  a month ago, when I wasn't exercising for 3 weeks I weighted 68,4 kg. I measure 170cm so I'm just 2 kg away from being overweight. 

I was hoping to at least keep that 68,5kg weight, I don't know what have I done wrong. It made me not want to do anything, not Care for myself, start binging on everything and just wait till I am as fat as those TLC/MTV ""my 600 pound life"" people so that I can say it's not my fault I'm addicted to food, and then someone would tell me what to do and after losing initial weight would give me a gastric sleeve surgery, and until I hit that almost death point I could just eat whatever I want and how much I want

I've been hitting the swimming pool 3 times a week for the past two weeks to the point that today I cant even stand  without bending my knees because my leg muscles are so sore. I do 40 minutes of aqua-Fitness plus 30 min to an hour of general swimming activities (sport swimming for 10 minutes aka till I don't feel comfortable breathing, recreational swimming, going on waterslides early in the morning when there is no queue so I don't mostly just wait in the line but actually walk up the stairs) and then realaxing in jacuzzi or tepidarium (like a sauna but not that hot) or taking sunbath.
On top of that I walk to the swimming pool and back so it's ca 18 Minute walk one way
On the days I don't swim I take a walk, either to old city or for food shopping, and somethimes throw in weight lifting

I don't eat too bad, only sweet thing I eat this week were 2 protein waffles after swimming to regain energy for the walk back home where I could get proper lunch and two ice cream - one instead of a supper, on walk to old city and one that okay I agree was not justified.
For dinner my portion is 2/3 of my boyfriend's portion and half of the time I finish my portion for supper because I can't eat everything in one sitting."	im_AmTheOne	post	29.513732726682804	female	White	0.9977706670761108	na	na	na	4	selfhelp
"You need to separate health and fitness from the number on the scale.

Muscle weighs more than fat, and requires more food/energy to maintain, so I implore you to work on looking past the numbers and just focus on how you look and feel in yourself.

There‚Äôs hundreds of images of men and women online who start off at a weight, work out, and end up heavier but also in better shape than when they started.

Weight is important don‚Äôt get me wrong, but it doesn‚Äôt account for your body composition (muscle/fat/water) and it doesn‚Äôt trump how you feel about your body in terms of look and general physical/mental wellbeing.

Keep swimming and you‚Äôll find you get fitter, stronger, your muscles will tone up and get bigger, and sure you might gain a bit of weight but I would also do a body composition calculation as well.

You‚Äôre doing the right thing by exercising and looking after your body, keep at it and be sure to look at articles/subs regarding fitness, weight, and physical/mental wellbeing"	im_AmTheOne	reply	na	na	na	0.9977706670761108	weak	no	no	na	selfhelp

"People don't realize that when they start exercising the body will ""ask"" for more food as they expend more energy and our bodies are homeostatic meaning they will try to preserve the status quo which means the body will ask for more food rather than expend energy from fat reserves as it will try to preserve them.   

In addition to getting motivated to exercise one should also have a firm intention on reducing/altering food intake. 

> protein waffles after swimming to regain energy    

Your goal is to lose weight through losing energy as the fat will be broken down and transformed into energy. So if you feel exhausted don't eat anything so that you can continue exercising, just stop and let your body rebalance itself. The mind is playing a trick with you - it wants to eat so it says I need to eat this so I can exercise more.     

If you want to lose weight, you need to really rethink and reinvent your diet. You need a balanced diet. If you weigh 68kg and you want to lose 5kg then you need to reduce your food intake by about 7%. Opt for low glycemic food vs high glycemic. And you need the correct proportions of fats, carbs and protein.

"So first, I would like to thank you for even taking the time to read this. 

I'm a male, 16 years old. Over some time now, I've realized I've got quite some problems going on in my life that I need to fix. I don't trust anyone in my real life to truly understand what I'm saying without them being judgemental about it. Therefore, here I am, kind of venting out on this subreddit.

1) Maladaptive Daydreaming- I'm almost always daydreaming when I'm alone instead of actually doing something. I can daydream for hours and this obviously wastes a lot of my time. I later regret doing this. And my daydreams are usually about my actual life, where my life is a bit better. I'm more outgoing and social, and living a better life in general. Due to this, I end up procrastinating a lot too.

2) Can never live in the present- This is kind of similar to MD which I mentioned above. However, whenever I try to stop dreaming or even scrolling social media and just look around in the present for once, try to calm down, I literally never can. Idk if it's anxiety but it feels like that. Doing nothing/thinking nothing and just being in the present is literally impossible for me. I start feeling this heaviness in my heart and wanna go back to dreaming or scrolling media.

3) Lack of social skills- It's usually very hard for me to socialize with other people my age. I'm really bad at small talk and I don't seem to fit in as much. I'm also very quiet and don't talk much at home as well. However, if there is something to talk about any of my interests, I can talk for a very long while. 

4) No sense of self/ lack of self identity- I literally don't know who the fuck I truly am. Like I look in the mirror and ask myself, what defines me or what are my principles, and I can literally come up with no reply. All my life I've been labelled as the nice kid by my teachers, peers, parents, relatives and who not. But I don't know if that's me. A part of me thinks that I'm not truly that good, but I had to be that way because my dad was really strict until my early teens. So I had to behave at home how he defined the behaviour 'good'. So I probably started behaving as a ""good"" person everywhere I went simply out of fear. Now even while I write this, I don't know if I'm truly a good person that everyone says I am or I behave strictly out of fear. I always find myself looking upto fictional characters, trying to be like them, picking out some of their traits and try instilling them in myself. And obviously, this doesn't work for much time

5) I'm a highly sensitive person- This is probably the only established trait about me that could be true. Ever since I was a kid, I used to cry at every small thing. Whenever my dad yelled at me, I got hurt or anything. I also take a lot of things to heart and remember them forever. However, I'm also extremely empathetic, whenever something, bad happens to anyone, I imagine myself in their position and try not to make fun about them. I try to understand everyone to the full extent but nobody can really understand me lol. However, if someone does something bad to me, I can hold grudges about them for a long long time and can wish them bad luck in my mind. 
And whenever someone is too harsh/blunt with their words, I take them personally and get upset. So often times, people just fake themselves around me just so they can make sure they don't hurt my feelings. I end up overthinking what everyone truly thinks. I do realize tho that this is a 100% me problem and shouldn't be blamed on other people.

So these were mainly the issues I've been facing for quite some time now. Advice for any/all of these problems are welcomed."	AfraidSummer7451	post	14.285895295559534	male	White	0.9495187401771545	na	na	na	1	selfhelp

"You want to get over loneliness? You must find or build a community of friends/acquaintances. Easy? No, especially for introverts like myself, but that's the only path I can see when I face loneliness. You need to find interests that you are passionate about and find others that share your passion, then just ask questions about them to get to know them. Try not to talk too much about yourself unless asked so they feel listened to and they should reciprocate.

Your concern about jobs and parents: I went to get a degree and took about a decade to finish my bachelor's because I wasn't good at studying. I took out so many loans, and I'll regret that... but not everyone graduates in 4 years. Not everyone moves out. But have you considered going to university for something? Pick a major that you'd be interested to work in, take out student loans and apply for scholarships. Move into the dorms (roommate, not lonely). Get a part time job or campus job. Join a campus club....

That may help.

Jobs: do you customize your resume? Do you write a cover letter explaining your interest and how you match their core values found online? Do you go to the interview prepared with 3-5 stories that match with a bunch of general interview questions found online? Do you try to think about what it's like to be a manager/business owner/customer and how you would in your role help each of them out?

"I'd reccomend to try something different for work, Do you like animals? You can pet sit or dog walk on Rover and Wag. If you do that for a bit, you can use that as experience when applying to other jobs. And Rover and Wag are freelance, so you don't need to worry about being hired. Maybe a big change of location would be helpful. There are seasonal jobs in different parts of the world that may a good change of pace. I know there's many opportunities in Alaska and if you're working a seasonal gig, many other folks will also be from other places and, therefore, more open to meeting people and making friends. If you like taking care of kids, you could be a sleepaway camp counselor.

For making friends try the Meetups and Geneva apps. Do you like any sort of sport, or do you want to try one? There are non-competitive teams out there! Even for things like skee-ball or cornhole haha. But that can be a great way to meet friends- might be able to find these on Instagram, Facebook, or just googling. There are also tons of social groups for people who are religious or in the lgbtq community. You could join a bookclub. If you're into games, check out your nearest game store. They may have ttrpg nights. 

The most important thing I'd recommend, though, would be talking to a therapist. From my own experience and reading your post, I think you could be dealing with some depression.

"I used to feel generally good about myself. I made mistakes like anyone, but in general, I felt - morally just. Clean. Then during a particularly hard time in my life, I made some poor choices, out of character for me, and I hurt people.  Some time later, reflecting back, I can see how selfish I was then - something I couldn't see at the time. I checked all the boxes of what someone should do when faced with what I now know is chronic depression, amongst other diagnoses - I went to several therapists, I went on antidepressants...and still, I made poor choices and I feel so ashamed.

I'm seeing a wonderful psychologist, so I'm not looking for additional mental health help. I exercise daily and I eat very well, so physically I'm already doing a lot to try to feel my best mentally.  I'm not religious - but I really wish I was because I think I need some sense of forgiveness. I think anyone who knows me would say I'm a very nice person, and I try my best to be as good a person as I can be, through volunteering, etc. But no matter how good a person I pretend to be, I still feel the crushing weight of my past selfish actions, which overshadows all of the good choices I've made. And when I feel bad, or when bad things happen to me, I feel like it's karma and I deserve it.

How can I move on from this? It's been many years now.

"Year to year, month to month, minute to minute we are changing. Life events, growth we're trying to achieve and just time itself is all shaping us into who we are at this moment. Thinking about it this way I can look back at different times in my life and see that who I am today would behave very differently than who I was in the past in many situations. Think of the many things you did and felt as a child that are just completely unlike who you are today.

If you can try to view things this way then instead of seeing yourself today as the bearer of this burden of all your life's mistakes you can instead see yourself as distinct today from who you were in the past. You can then maybe begin to think of your past you as someone who made mistakes, like everyone else and who deserves forgiveness, like everyone else and most importantly behaves differently today partly because of those mistakes you made.

With that perspective you may be able to see that what happened in your past had to happen for you to be who you are today. You describe yourself kindly, and it sounds like you are happy with who you are now. So rather than saying you did something terrible and today and in the suture you deserve punishment for it take an honest look at what happened ask ask yourself ""Could I even be who I am today without having experienced those things that cause me distress today? If I hadn't would that mean I would have made the same bad choices later, maybe in even worse circumstances?""

For me, this recognition, that who I am right now is the sum of ALL my growth and experience and that I don't want to change who I am, I've learned that I can't not forgive myself.

I am envious of people who can feel themselves forgiven and move on, but at the same time, I see them as selfish. I gave up/turned away from the pleasurable pieces of my life that were a direct result of my poor choices because I don't see how someone can repent while still enjoying the fruits of their sins.  Yet it happens all the time.  Are they being selfish? Or do they simply have the ability to move on, and I don't?

"" Because God wants you to suffer always, for your sins, for sins that were committed before you were born, for sins you only thought about, but never actually did. That is a lot of suffering. 

Selfish is a word that comes with this worldview. If you are rich, you are selfish, therefore bad. If you are happy, you are selfish, because you are not suffering for all the sins that you committed before or will do later. No room for happiness. If you don't clean up your plate you are selfish, because there are people in the world going hungry . If you take a vacation you are selfish, if you stop and smell the flowers, literally or figuratively... Yeah, you guessed. 

It is not bad to let go, if you are supposed to forgive what was done unto you, why wouldn't you forgive what you did unto others? When you screwed up it is great if you apologize, not the muttered ""Sorry"" when you bump into someone, but a genuine, heart felt apology - ""I am sorry I did that, I am sorry what this did to you. It was mindless of me not seeing what it would mean to you."" No excuses, no pushing the blame into the other person. I mean no ""I was not in a good place at the time"" Who cares, you hurt someone.  and no ""You made me do it."" Say it, email it, send a letter, expect nothing in return and move on. 

We of the catholic worldview have a sneaky way of blaming ourselves for everything. Things we did, things that were done to us and things we have no control of. The first one is kinda real (if you forget that you are human and flawed), but the last two are pure magical thinking. You got raped, it is your fault because you were there and you were wearing clothes. You thought you wanted someone to die and they eventually die. It is your fault, because apparently your thoughts have the power to kill someone, not because we think things and eventually they happen, specially things that are certain like death. 

It is impossible to live like this, specially when you left the church behind, because you miss all the opportunities for forgiveness (confession, mass) and keep all the blame. I left the church because I realized that God let me get hurt too much and was too stingy in his forgiveness and love. I came pretty close to the lunatic asylum. At the transition, I was keeping all the blame, all the suffering and no love. I eventually articulated that I had become an atheist and that God if he exists, is evil. You are right, enough is enough.

Here goes, for what it is worth: I love you for your humanity and I forgive all the sins that were pushed in to you. Forgive yourself and love yourself and move on. Here I make the sign of the middle finger for God and suffering. :)"	MoreLikeNel	reply	na	na	na	0.9973121881484985	weak	strong	no	na	selfhelp
"It's a story of my close friend, Rishabh. I will ask him to follow good suggestions from you.

It started 6 years ago. I made a lot mistakes and wasted my time. I'm in big debt and it's scaring now. I don't have much options. But, I didn't misuse the fund on myself. I used this fund to support my family, my younger brothers and a very few needs of mine. I have good knowledge of starting a company, coding and cooking. I wrote everything about  my mistakes on paper honestly and I confess, I was wrong. Hoping for a good suggestions

Note: I don't want financial suggestions, I want your help to shape my life and suggestions to improve my situation.

"You're going to remember your mistakes. It can't be avoided. Trying *not* to remember your mistakes is like trying not to think of a pink elephant - the harder you try, the more it happens.

I recommend two things:

1. Write down the mistake that is bothering you, and what lesson you learned from it. Try to focus on your values, specifically (things like honesty, hard work, trustworthiness, etc.). Next, think about a *current* project or problem that you are facing, and write about how you are going to act differently and what you're going to focus on, based on the lesson you learned from your past mistake. Take that past lesson, and get detailed about the steps you're actively taking now to be a different person.

2. Practice Radical Acceptance. Stop wishing you had acted differently in the past. You acted the way you did, because that was the person you were. Now you're a new person who has learned from that, and now you have the ability to make new choices going forward. Accept that being imperfect is an unavoidable part of being human. Accept yourself as you were, and accept yourself as you are, and move forward."	Nerd_the_sapiophile	reply	na	na	na	0.0017918780213221908	no	no	no	na	selfhelp
Convince yourself that mistakes aren't bad, they're a learning experience. Without mistakes how could we appreciate our victories? It helps me to know that by making mistakes we learn how to do it right and hang on through the process. Life would be be pretty boring without some good ole f***-ups along the way! When you don't make a mistake and get it right, treat yourself to something special maybe. I think ultimately it's about finding balance between the good and the bad and when your mind focuses on mistakes, remember all the other things you've accomplished because it's just as important to remember those too. Idk I'm rambling, but I know I tend to focus on my failures to the point of like self-sabotage, but if you make it a point to do/think something else everytime you lean towards every failure or mistake you've ever made, you develop a habit of replacing bad thoughts about yourself. It takes time, but don't beat yourself up so much because you deserve to be happy for your accomplishments more often than to be upset over your mistakes. If that makes sense? Hope this helps!!!!

"Hey you.

I‚Äôm directly talking to YOU.

You probably feel like you don‚Äôt deserve to be here, like other people in the self improvement community are _better_ than you, further ahead that you, more _special_ than you, _cooler_ than you.

2 personal friends of mine (who everyone else would say is elite) told me, one after the other, 2 days apart, that they don‚Äôt feel like they deserve to be in the communities they are in, full of other go getters.

One in particular even said he‚Äôs jealous of the other guy and compares himself to that guy all the time ‚Äì and then that other guy told me 2 days later that he feels like a massive fraud who doesn‚Äôt belong.

I told one of them all of this and he said, _‚ÄúI‚Äôm so insecure I never woulda guessed people look up to me.""_

It‚Äôs a great point ‚Äì I‚Äôm insecure about a million things. Of course I am, I‚Äôm human. I‚Äôm not perfect.

And a tonne of my clients tell me that they're insecure and don‚Äôt feel like they belong, like they're not cool enough to be trying to get what they want in life. I‚Äôve lost count of the number of people that feel like they don‚Äôt belong in various self improvement groups, whether that is ‚Äúpeople who are improving their finances‚Äù or ‚Äúpeople who are losing weight‚Äù or just generally ‚Äúpeople who are working on improving themselves‚Äù

I‚Äôll tell you right now, cool has nothing to do with it. ‚ÄúGood enough‚Äù has nothing to do with it. ‚ÄúDeserve‚Äù has nothing to do with it. Success is EARNED, it is not deserved. If you want success, if you want to reach your goals, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you‚Äôre good enough or cool enough or deserve it ‚Äì in fact, you WON‚ÄôT be good enough at the start.

You haven‚Äôt EARNED it yet.

All that matters is you keep pushing forward, keep striving for more, and never ever quit.

Quite a few years ago when I was a bit more of a newbie to the self improvement thing, I always felt like I didn‚Äôt belong. Like I wasn‚Äôt good enough. Any success I had in the past, I would put it down to just being a ‚Äúfluke‚Äù and I‚Äôd ‚Äúgotten lucky‚Äù and sooner or later they‚Äôd all find out I was actually a loser. I didn‚Äôt feel like I could ever make it.

I didn‚Äôt feel like I could ever be cool enough.

The same thing with my finances ‚Äì I‚Äôd always been in debt. I never felt like I deserved _not_ to be in debt. Even when I got to a point where I could go full-time with coaching, I felt like I was an imposter. A fraud. Like I‚Äôd just gotten ‚Äúlucky‚Äù, whatever the fuck that means.

News flash, most people who succeed feel like ‚ÄúI just got lucky‚Äù for a long time, until they finally internalise ‚ÄúNo I EARNED this‚Äù. But that takes time; often months, sometimes years. It‚Äôs so normal, so common, to feel like an imposter and a fraud even after you succeed at something. But I promise you that fades eventually and you realise, ‚ÄúI worked hard to get here. It wasn‚Äôt luck. It was hard work, a stubborn refusal to ever quit, and just taking tiny little baby steps towards my goal every day. I deserve to be here.‚Äù

I‚Äôm talking to all of you that feel like this.

You fucking deserve to be here.

You‚Äôre so much better than the average guy.

You care enough to fix your issues.

You‚Äôre aware of your flaws and you‚Äôre actively working on them.

You have the courage to admit you want something more from life, you don‚Äôt want to be complacent.

You‚Äôre terrified of getting to the end of your life and having regrets, and you‚Äôre brave enough to face that fear and do something to prevent it from happening.

You‚Äôre terrified of being average. You‚Äôre terrified of not being good enough. You‚Äôre here addressing that fear, learning, taking action, working on yourself. You‚Äôve run from average and run towards something greater; you‚Äôve sought out other people who want to be better too.

I know when you‚Äôre so acutely aware of all your flaws, all your insecurities, all the reasons you aren‚Äôt good enough, it‚Äôs very easy to feel like you don‚Äôt belong.

It‚Äôs very easy to feel like you‚Äôre an imposter.

It‚Äôs very easy to feel like other people are better than you, that you‚Äôre on your own, that they‚Äôre all in a club together and you‚Äôre an outsider. That you‚Äôre not the cool kid and you can never be with the other cool kids.

But that isn‚Äôt the case. We all felt like losers at the start.

I felt like the world‚Äôs biggest loser, for YEARS I felt like I didn‚Äôt belong and shouldn‚Äôt be here.

But even with all my insecurities, fears and doubts, I still made it. Even me, the loser called Andy was able to make it, despite never believing he deserved to.

And if I can do it, **you sure as hell can too.**"	LimeRevolutionary184	post	22.649318620233043	male	White	0.004539472050964832	na	na	na	2	selfhelp

"Recently I've been thinking about how many toxic traits us humans have can actually be quite good for us & others around us, i came up with some examples & would love if anyone wants to add some to this list or give me any feedback//discourse on your thoughts.   


a few examples of toxic traits people may possess & how they may be used for good:

**‚Äî 1st Example ‚Äî** 

Toxic Trait: Overworker: someone who works constantly & can‚Äôt shut it off they are in love with work as opposed to their family & friends.

Potential Benefit: This person can use this trait they have to enjoy their work, this is a great thing that most people cannot do: to find something that feels like play to them but looks like work to others. This is the person who builds something no one else can, & potentially a product or service that changes lives.

‚Äî The overworking is shown in cases like Elon Musk, who is an amazing creator of companies that have changed the world & continue to do so, sleeping in the factory floor some nights even. This makes Elon Musk excel in this area of his life, at the cost of other things, to him, I assume he is spending his time on what matters most.

‚ÄúI remember him saying, ‚ÄòBeing with me was choosing the hard path.‚Äô I didn‚Äôt quite understand at the time, but I do now. It‚Äôs quite hard, quite the crazy ride.‚Äù ‚Äî Talulah Riley, who has twice been divorced from Musk.

There was another quote about Musk I heard years ago from another one of his ex-wives, the quote mentioned how Elon is an incredible leader, but not the best partner.

This is to highlight that by excelling at such a high level like Elon Musk has, there will be large imbalances in nonbusiness aspects of his life.

This toxic trait Elon Musk possesses to work on what he deems critically important has positive benefits & negative ones, but the positive one nonetheless is still there, & its shiny & helpful to millions of people around the globe.

**‚Äî 8 More Subjective Examples ‚Äî**

Toxic Trait: Assertiveness: Being excessively assertive (sometimes comes across as aggressive or domineering)

Potential Benefit: In certain situations, assertiveness can be channeled positively to stand up for yourself or others, advocate for important causes, and negotiate effectively (avoid being scammed).

Toxic Trait: Perfectionism - Having an obsessive focus on perfection and being overly critical of oneself and others.

Potential Benefit: A moderate level of perfectionism can be beneficial in certain professions or situations that require high attention to detail, such as medical surgeries, engineering, or creative projects.

Toxic Trait: Independence - Being overly independent and resistant to seeking help or collaboration. 

Potential Benefit: Independence can be advantageous in roles that require self-motivation, entrepreneurship, leadership, or in general when we want to create something without outside influence.

Toxic Trait: Skepticism - Excessively doubting or questioning the credibility of information or others' intentions.

Potential Benefit: In fields like scientific research or investigative journalism, a healthy dose of skepticism can lead to critical thinking and accurate conclusions. 

A quote to add about critical thinking ‚Äî Yes, in a microwave world, thinking is a superpower - Tommy Baker.

Toxic Trait: Competitiveness - Being overly competitive and prioritizing winning above all else.

Potential Benefit: Controlled and sportsmanlike competitiveness can drive individuals to push their limits and achieve personal growth and success. When paired against competition or a newly set high people find a way to push past their prior limits.

Toxic Trait: Resilience - Being overly resilient and refusing to acknowledge or process emotions in challenging situations.

Potential Benefit: Resilience can help individuals bounce back from adversity and continue to pursue their goals, fostering strength in the face of difficult times.

Toxic Trait: Confidence - Overestimating one's abilities and disregarding others' opinions. 

Potential Benefit: Having a reasonable level of self-confidence can inspire others, facilitate decision-making, and allow for taking calculated risks. Being overconfident could also work in one‚Äôs favor especially as opposed to having a lack of confidence.

"**The Defining Decade Why Your Twenties Matter--And How to Make the Most of Them Now** by Meg Jay


>The Defining Decade has changed the way millions of twentysomethings think about their twenties‚Äîand themselves. Revised and reissued for a new generation, let it change how you think about you and yours. Our ""thirty-is-the-new-twenty"" culture tells us the twentysomething years don't matter. Some say they are an extended adolescence.
>
>Others call them an emerging adulthood. In The Defining Decade, Meg Jay argues that twentysomethings have been caught in a swirl of hype and misinformation, much of which has trivialized the most transformative time of our lives. Drawing from more than two decades of work with thousands of clients and students, Jay weaves the latest science of the twentysomething years with behind-closed-doors stories from twentysomethings themselves. The result is a provocative read that provides the tools necessary to take the most of your twenties, and shows us how work, relationships, personality, identity and even the brain can change more during this decade than at any other time in adulthood‚Äîif we use the time well.

James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.
>
>If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals.

>You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights. Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work.

>Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field. Learn how to: make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy); overcome a lack of motivation and willpower; design your environment to make success easier; get back on track when you fall off course; ...and much more. Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.

"I was 29 when I read the first book by Meg Jay and I found the information extremely relevant. The author is a therapist herself and she had many of her clients who were in their twenties. Meg Jay had permission from her clients (with fake names, of course) to write the major themes that young adults went through (i.e. education, relationships, living with your partner, and etc). Each theme is a life lesson for readers like you and me. When we read those stories from her clients, it helps us on what to do AND WHAT NOT TO DO so that we can transition very well in the 30's.  


Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People is a game-changer for my social skills. Vanessa Van Edwards was once a socially awkward person growing up, so she used her childhood experience, along with her research to gather all the social skills that are helpful in public settings. Honestly, Vanessa Van Edwards gave us so much good info on how to ""crack the human personality code"" of other people based on their traits.   


Check with your local library to see if they have these books so that you don't have to waste your money on purchasing. Once you do that, check over their table of contents so that you can make a good judgment of yourself. Don't be afraid to send me DM if you want more recommendation books for self-improvement.

I don‚Äôt want to get too personal but I‚Äôve spent the last 8 years of my life going to therapy, healing trauma, learning how to deal with emotions, soul searching and just trying to figure out who i am and who i want to be. With that said I have made great progress in my journey but i am left with no personality outside of that. My life these 8 years has been nothing but self improvement and I feel that i lost part myself along the way. Although I worked through my anxiety, when I get into any social situation, I have nothing to contribute because all i know is self improvement and i‚Äôve always wondered how much was enough. I don‚Äôt know where to start to even develop any type of interesting qualities. I try to do things fun like the gym or watching movies and stuff like that but all i can think about is how this experience is going to refine the way i think and feel.

Drawing or crochet or painting or woodworking or whatever you feel like trying. 

Go to some classes if you can, learn from the internet, just try. 

I think you are too much in your head and you need something tangible to take you out of it. It is hard to think about thinking about when you have to get something to work with your hands. Frustration is part of this, but it is also part of the joy and pride that comes from completing a project.

I have been in a relationship with my bf for almost 2 years now. In the beginning of our relationship, everything was okay. I was happy, I was secure about myself, I didn‚Äôt feel any type of possessiveness. Further into our relationship, I noticed red flags within myself. I noticed myself being overly controlling and crossing boundaries (not wanting him to hang out with his friends, not wanting him to like pictures of his female friends, not wanting him to add female friends in facebook). I used to be okay in the beginning of our relationship, but now its so easy for me to feel insecure and jealous and angry all the time. During our arguments, I would raise my voice and say hurtful things I do not mean. I sometimes cant control my anger. I do not know what‚Äôs happening with me or how I can fix myself. I feel very hopeless in turning back this relationship to what it once was. Please help.	Born-Ad-3199	post	35.002671875133174	female	White	0.9985195994377136	na	na	na	5	selfhelp
"If you can believe it, the easiest solution is actually to go to therapy, if you can afford it. Someone who is objective and trained can help you learn where the problem is and how to take care of yourself so you‚Äôre not as reactive and controlling with your partner. 

Go to therapy. Do not lie or fib at therapy. When your therapist starts to help you identify where your dysfunctions in thought are, you will feel bad, and this is part of the process. Keep going to therapy once this starts happening (once I hit this point, I quit therapy THREE TIMES because I was afraid of being so KNOWN by another person that I wasn‚Äôt romantically invested in).

I went to therapy for years and will probably go back sometime in the future when I need help arranging my own thoughts and fixing patterns in myself that I don‚Äôt like. It‚Äôs hard. You have to do it every day, and sometimes you fail. Sometimes you start yelling at your partner and then halfway through realize you‚Äôre yelling, and have to try and hit the brakes there and admit, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, this is wrong, and I‚Äôm trying to stop yelling.‚Äù 

The only way out is through; wanting to do better is a big step. Contact your insurance company and see if there are therapists that are covered, I was surprised to find out how many I had access to when I started. There is also, usually through a university, a program where you can receive therapy with cost determined by a sliding scale based on income. For a while, I got therapy for free this way (and quit because the work scared me).

" A lot of people struggle on [saying no](https://www.toodat.com/community/Learningto/LoveLife/9QqM7e5yn8e2vp5l) and it turns out, I've found out it's more common in women navigating through sociial relationships.

Learning to say NO is a freeing and empowering experience. The more you practice it, the simpler it becomes. However, the difficult thing about it is it's really hard to start! A lot of times, we couldn't say no because we want to be helpful and caring, but in the process, we risk losing ourselves. Boundaries are very important in any relationship that's why it's essential to know when to say yes and when to say no-- to set healthy boundaries.

You might feel exhausted always saying yes, but I've discovered that while people like agreeable folks, they don't really respect them. When you start setting boundaries, some people might get upset, but it's usually because they benefited from you not having any. Don't worry, it gets easier with time. Start by practicing small steps towards saying no when necessary."	No-Quail1037	post	13.707937569304269	male	White	0.002345443470403552	na	na	na	1	selfhelp

"Therapy is a great place to learn what words mean and what you mean by them. Sometimes there is a mismatch there. 

Can you explain what is your problem with being domineering? 

Let me tell you one little anecdote of mine. I was always accused of being selfish by my mom. For instance my mom would give my clothes away, because she wanted to suck up to someone, to show how nice she was. She never asked permission, nor did she choose things that didn't fit anymore. When I got angry, I was called selfish. 

When I told my therapist I was called selfish, he laughed. He knows I am not, I know I am not. But I really needed someone to validate me in that. 

Turns out I am a generous person. I care about people, I ended up a minimalist and I give away the things I dont need anymore mostly to people around me, sometimes even to charity (I am not a huge fan of charities because they are always religious and I am an atheist)."

"It sounds like you were able to find a really good fit with your therapist! I'm happy for you that it worked out and it sounds like you've been able to move on to a healthy way of thinking. I know that isn't always easy, good job!

As for my problem with ""domineering"" - I can try to explain. I'm not always great at clearly expressing myself but here goes:

It isn't that I fear being perceived as domineering. I'm not too concerned with how others see me, but I have a fear of becoming legitimately domineering. I know how it feels to be at the mercy of someone who is like that and I wouldn't want to inflict that on anyone. I'm not sure if my fear is rational or not, that is to say, I don't know how likely I am to actually become ""domineering"" since I do care about others feelings and such. I just have this feeling like I don't know where a clear line is, and I fear that it's a slippery slope.

Here's a scenario that's come up more than once; My husband has an issue with being negative. Oftentimes when I suggest doing something, his first response is to respond negatively, i.e. ""I don't feel like doing that"". I feel like I'm in a position where my choices are to either accept his refusal or badger him into it, and I really don't like to feel as if I'm badgering someone... but then later he might tell me something like ""I wish you'd not accept defeat so easily"".

I hope that doesn't paint him in a bad light. He has some things to work on, to be sure. (Don't we all?) But I think overall he's an alright guy."	Good_Carrot_1561	follow-up	na	na	na	0.998068630695343	weak	no	no	na	selfhelp

"I am working on a lot, key point is workING. It is an on going process. I love my therapist, we are very similar people with similar experiences. It was very hard to find. (I typed ""I love my therapist"" on autopilot, this reminds me to tell him this tomorrow.)

I see, you don't want to be bossy and a nag. You don't want to be the person that dictates things to others. Usually what we fear most is what we are not. I mean, if you are afraid of it so much, it probably is not your natural tendency and / or you were traumatized by someone who was. 

When it comes to your husband, it seems his default answer for most anything is no. It is as much of a problem as people whose default response is yes. It would not be a terrible thing for you to drop the subject in the moment, but come back to it later when he had some time to process. That, in my opinion, would not be ""forcing him to do something he doesn't want to do"", just working with him in something that impacts the both of you. 

You don't paint him in any light besides being a human with some ingrained tendencies. I am a little like him, when someone asks me to go somewhere my automatic answer would always be ""hell, no. I want to be left alone."" but that is not really true. I like to be around people, I just have to remind myself to say yes, because I'll thank myself later."

"My younger cousin (17) has a very bad screentime/video game addiction (adhd amplfies this). She can never seem to motivate herself to exercise, eat healthy, etc. That's when I thought of creating an AI accountability pet for her that she kind of takes care of.

She found the buggy alpha version really helpful, currently this is how it works:

1. Everyday you log your good and bad habits (such as video games), failing habits hurts your Doxo, and completing them gives him EXP! Level him up, and unlock different perks.
2. You check in with your Doxo where he will give you feedback, inspiration and science-backed advice in order to help you stick with your habits and helps monitor + lower your screentime user.
3. You can send your Doxo on adventures to collect coins, and use them to buy badges and emotes.
4. If you want to use social media (which Doxo blocks), *you have to pay Doxo coins for every minute you want to use a blocked app. she found this the most helpful. Lowered her screentime by 83%, and she gets rewarded for it.*

i don't want to break self promotion rules so i'll not be posting any links here. that said, i'd love to hear your guys opinion about it, and maybe some feature requests.

It's an interesting debate, using gamification to help you fight other addictions. It seems almost counterintuitive, but the way I think about it, Tik Tok and Facebook are billion dollar companies that optimize their product for super long use, not for user growth. At the end of the day, if someone uses an app and the end result is that they feel fulfilled and proud, versus feeling like they wasted their time then I see it as justified.

Not using gamification to me is like going to a kid in a candy store and trying to tempt him with some brocoli."	Goodd0ctor	post	25.352254641592594	female	White	0.0018948701908811927	na	na	na	8	selfhelp

Hi, I‚Äôm 17 and today was maybe the scariest day of my life. Today I was home with my 7 year old sister and my best friend who is also 17. My dad and brother had left to go get some boxes from our old house we just moved from and my mom was at work. This house we have makes it kinda hard to let out our 4 outside. They get along okay except for our 5 year old pit bull and American bully mix and our 1 year old French bulldog. Our frenchie sleeps in a cage in my sisters room while our bigger dogs sleep in my parents room, all in cages. Today my frenchie was put in a cage in our living room, and he loves to bark. While letting out my larger pit bull, he got away from me and tried to break down my frenchies cage to eat him. My pit bull is around 100 pounds and huge, he has a huge head and very muscular, so he broke through the wooden cage easily. He got ahold of our frenchie and they fought for almost an hour. Me being the only one who kinda new what to do, I got on top of the pit bull and tried pulling him off, my frenchie wasn‚Äôt helping this cause he was fighting back. My friend took my sister to my aunt and uncles house down the road and tried to get help. As I was fighting a dog almost the same weight as me, I became covered in blood and slobber, from both dogs. I screamed and yelled and cried for anyone to come help. I sounded like someone was getting murdered. No one came to help. Finally I ran to the neighbors and all they saw was 2 17 years covered in blood, and a 7 year old crying. They didn‚Äôt help, they called the cops and ordered my dogs be put down. I ran back home to find my phone and called everyone I could. The problem is now resolved and no dogs were badly hurt, my frenchies eyes are blood red due to his blood vessels popping but only small cuts. Me however, I have bruises and cuts everywhere, and before I showered, blood on my arms and clothes and legs. This was the scariest moment of my entire life and idk how to help cope with it. My dogs aren‚Äôt being put down, they are getting fixed to help with the aggression. But I‚Äôm terrified to look or touch any dogs, I couldn‚Äôt even let my friends dog smell me cause all I can envision is dog teeth coming to bite me. I just wanna be able to breathe, so if anyone has any way of helping please do.	that_one_makeup_girl	post	29.03579395715	female	White	0.09074573218822479	na	na	na	1	selfhelp
"Ummm... This is a kind of experience I've never experienced/heard anyone experience till now...
But yes it could be a potential trauma since there was some blood and aggression involved.
 I think giving it some time would definitely heal your fear. Try staying away from dogs for a few weeks as you said ... And then try getting back to em... Initially you're still gonna be hesitant to do so, but you won't be as afraid as you are now. If the fear still doesn't leave you, give it more time. But if you feel this is something that's gonna permanently burn into your mind, try forcing yourself to play with a least aggressive dog you know, for I can assure you that no dog would ever hurt you unless you were really abusive towards it. Just because it was aggressive towards its rival doesn't mean it's gonna do the same to you.

"Hi everyone!

I have noticed recently that my need for constant reassurance from my family and friends is getting to be more than I (and they) would like. I feel like I always need to ask them if the response I sent my boss is ""ok"" and clear or if I'm ""in the wrong"" about insignificant and small issues that come up on the day to day. I realized that I am bothering them because my sister, who I can usually talk to about the same thing over and over. snapped at me today. Like an example is if I have an awkward encounter with someone that I barely know I will not stop thinking about it/ talking about it even if it is not a big deal and constantly will ask ""was it weird that I said xyz?"" or something like that. How do you guys cope with this feeling of wanting approval from your loved ones but not wanting to bother them?

"When you notice yourself starting to seek approval for something mundane, get mindful and think about that and ""just stop"". Send out a text and then don't ask anybody if it was okay. Your fear of failure is taking over. You need to accept that sometimes it will be okay to make mistakes and it's not a big deal and nobody is thinking about it as hard as you do not even the person you've said something dumb to or made a mistake in front of. Most people are too busy worrying about their own BS and they aren't recapping what you've said or done to them. Prove to yourself that you don't need the validation or reassurance by letting yourself forgo asking for it sometimes. You need to build up your trust in yourself that you can do things without asking permission or for approval because you're not incompetent. So yeah you need to learn how to trust yourself. You need to learn how to not be afraid of failing or even worse being afraid of succeeding.

I (23m) feel like I‚Äôve lost myself. It‚Äôs strange but it feels like I‚Äôm just an automatic program at this point. It feels like I don‚Äôt find anything meaningful and don‚Äôt care about anyone or anything. Over the years I struggled a lot with anxiety and caring too much about things which manifested itself into behaviour like obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and irrational intrusive thoughts. It‚Äôs gotten to the point now where I feel like I have no willingness to do anything anymore, just seek comfort and live in fantasy in my head. The voice in my mind is now telling me that the only way out would be through some sort of death or near-death experience which could wake me up. I feel like a loser with nothing to give, and only take validation from interactions unable able to have real human connections on any level except verbal. I feel dead inside and have no base of identity. I think it‚Äôs from the repressed anxiety but kind of don‚Äôt feel like I can even access it at this point.

"I legit thought I was reading an old post of mine haha. If it helps to know you‚Äôre not alone I go through the same struggles. You‚Äôre feeling stuck in a cycle of unpleasant thoughts and feelings. The life and death situation is not far off to what I‚Äôd suggest which is joining an intensive work out class you can commit to seeing results weekly. The reason I suggest this is because of our hormones and neurotransmitters. They play a big role in our reality, how we experience life. I started doing CrossFit and it feels like a life and death scenario where every workout I could die. When I overcome this feat I feel so on top of the world. Lately I‚Äôve been using the gym and it‚Äôs been changing my hormones and mind to think more with confidence and optimism. The hard days are less hard because I put myself through difficulty for the positive results. This is like a philosophy. You can either work out and eat healthy or feel like crap a big portion of your life .

I struggle with ocd and anxiety so combined I over think I‚Äôm negative ways.

"i dont even want a GF, because i literally have no idea what we would talk about. sick of one line replies or me obsessively sending long texts trying to make them laugh. i really hate this version of my self. i want to change. 

i guess this is what i get for making my life goals ""Porn/Sexting"" im tired of basing my self worth on external things like this. i know i need to make my self happy and no one else will.

i dont know what other goals to chase other than ""Self Improvement""

Anytime i see someone having a fun/long conversation I get jealous and mad at my self for not having a Cool/Funny/Smart/Intelligent personalized like that. sometimes im even intimidated by them because i think that they are ""Too cool for me or better than me"" i hate this thinking. 

Tired of basing my self worth on the number of friends i have which are 0, or how many conversations i have which are pretty low or how people react to things i said. 

maybe i was just saying some things that i thought is what they wanted to hear not really what i wanted to say. sometimes i had no idea what to say though 

i want to improve my social skills and my conversations and my personality

i have messaged like thousands of girls online, mostly would respond with one word replies, i know the problem was me. 

maybe i wasn't really interested in getting to know them, i was just looking get nudes or sext to prove to my self that im worthy or cool or funny or ""Good enough"" 

besides that i really had no idea how to get to know them without making the conversations sound like an interview or boring then i would base my self worth on how i was boring and didn't know what to talk about. 

or i would run out of questions to ask quickly, basic it was like impossible to make a friend. it was impossible to get people to talk to me 

maybe i was just boring them and they were dealing with their own problems or busy days.

The conversations were always one sided, always me talking more, saying more, asking more questions, always starting the conversations after a day we talked. it was boring for me..

maybe i was looking to fill up my boredom by talking to girls? and i know thats not what girls are for. girls want to be connected and i want that too but had no idea how so i would just try to sext. 

i would ask questions and they would just say yes or no, nothing more. soon i would run out of things to talk about or i had no idea what to talk about 

because the conversions were boring i guess i was just losing interest because of how hard i tried with no results, i couldn't even make a friend

i was interested, then quickly lose interest because i had no idea what to talk about or what to say or what i should say. 

im not afraid to start conversations, i just don't know what to say. 

and pretty sure the girls dont want the conversation to just be about sex... 

i know i shouldn't look at girls as sex objects and they are human with goals, dreams, ambitions, Passions, and their own feelings. i know that now. 

but the idea of how i suck at making friends makes me lose interest in talking... 

would reading ""How to win Friends and Influence People"" help? or ""No more Mr nice Guy"" ? 

or just anything 

does this go back to self esteem issues? 

I have so many problems so many questions..

"Ok, here goes, a little bluntly. 

One: no woman will fix your life. Making this a priority is probably what is making you feel like a failure. You picked the wrong goal. Dating is sad. I just had a couple of weeks of trying this up again and it just made me angry and sad. 

Two: get a life you enjoy. There is no need for tons of money or lots of fame. You need to work towards something, whether you will achieve it or not. I didn't find your age, but if you are old enough, get a decent job. Decent as in legal and real. From trash collector to electrician. If you are in school, be in school, make really learning your goal. 

Three: get something you enjoy doing, just for doing it. That is how you meet people, you make friends with people who like doing what you like doing and take it from there. This is for you to enjoy and also for meeting people who also enjoy it. Something done with your hands, preferentially, because making real things is different than virtual things.

I'm going to be frank with you and I hope you read this and stop being so hard on yourself.
Women are people. They don't exist to please you or any other man.
Maybe you have a toxic environment for masculinity but women don't give a fuck. They don't exist because or for men.
And you don't need to prove your worth with women. You are enough. The only self worth that matters is what you give to yourself.
It's hard making friends but maybe if you find a hobby you can meet people who have things in common with you. Try to learn their names and details about them and be friends with someone you actually like.
I have notes on my phone with names, birthdays and things they like because I am really bad at making friends haha.

Secondly, don't fucking get emotional on girls. They are like commodities except for the fact that few of them earn and they think they fuckin won over you.

Im not complaining either of my parents, but sometimes when i see the way either of them reach to some situations i feel scared that I would end up the same, that even though i wanna react differently my subconscious will only do the exact same like i did with my girl back in college.

Everyone is influenced by their parents to an extent. If you see yourself acting in ways you don't like, try to stop and take a moment before you react. Being around other people more and going new places gives you a wider perspective on the world, that might help. Try new things, get out there and do stuff, it all affects how you think and feel.

"Hi, this is my first time posting anywhere, so if I make any mistakes, please bear with me. Thank you in advance.

I am a mom to a beautiful 1 year old boy. The initial days were fine when I was with family and had their support. However, things changed a lot when my husband and I moved to another city. I've developed a bad habit of constantly complaining about my baby - how he gives me a hard time and doesn't let me do the house chores. Even when we invite someone over, I always feel exhausted and not in the mood. My husband was very helpful in the beginning, but he also has to work, and my brain can't seem to accept that it's okay to take time.

1. I don't know if this is really happening because I tend to say negative things, especially about my baby, and now I regret it. I want to stop.

2. Am I genuinely exhausted, or is it just in my mind?

Please help me because I'm not sure if it's all in my head, or if I'm truly a bad mother who can't even handle her own child."	Mysterious-Touch-300	post	29.75586917455956	female	White	0.995062530040741	na	na	na	6	selfhelp

She also lives in another city 4 hours away from family and her husband works all day and is exhausted when he is home, which has made her a bit resentful that he doesn‚Äôt help her much throughout the week.

Venting can feel good but then make you feel bad afterwards because you can possibly overdo it or get too much from it and it's one thing to vent here and there but you really don't want to make it a habit because eventually your child will understand you and it will affect them and their self-esteem but for now your baby is small and you're stressed and probably dealing with PPD. You might need to start speaking to a therapist and working through some things there so that way they don't spill over into your home and you don't say things to people that you don't really want heard. If you're able to then I hope you can hire help or find something that works better for you like caring less about what can wait. But it's a good sign that you are noticing these things and that you are worried. That means you do love your child. And you're noticing the validation that you get from venting isn't solving the things that you're venting about and it's just making you feel bad at this point. Sometimes being in a negative headspace can make you more exhausted and more tired than you already are. And I know it's hard to hear somebody say well just have a better Outlook be more positive and things will get easier, because even though that's kind of true it's easier said than done and sounds inconsiderate. If you're too tired to have company, then don't have company. It's okay to focus on what's absolutely necessary and cut out the things that are just adding more stress. Good luck mama.

"I do understand that asking someone else to figure out what to do in life is not an ample way to live but i am currently in a situation where nothing seems to help me and i feel like I‚Äôm at a dead end. It‚Äôs soo confusing where when and what or what not to do.
Let me explain in short,
I was an engineering student and had lost control over my life in parties and freedom away from my parents and few months back i got expelled from my college for not clearing minimum subjects. Along my college days i was in a relationship and then broke up with her but that fucked up my mental health for which im currently being treated for depression and adhd.
My parents were supportive enough to accept i fucked up in my college and gave me another chance to study a smaller course while staying with them.
Everything is sort right now, and i know exactly what i want to do to get where i wanna be in life. But something holds me back everyday from doing the academics that i am supposed to be working on.
(ps* im currently on ritalin for my adhd, so its not about focus).
It‚Äôs just that i cant find a way to bring my life back to normal from such a drastic failure.
Everything is very confusing to choose what to do and how do to.
Also i am very VERY bad at spending money, and that too my parents money which makes me always think that im a piece of shit, 21 years old and frikin useless and a failure who‚Äôs not good and not capable of anything apart from spending dads money.
Somebody please help me on two things,
-> not enough motivation inside to do my academics but i strongly have the fire inside to succeed.
->become mature as im currently 21 years in old and im fucked up in every aspect of my life.

"My friend, as someone with more failures, and someone who experienced lots of bitterness in life, I want to share one thing with you: treat yourself like you are treating a good friend. Very good one. With way more compassion. And see that people in much older age are also making mistakes. 
You are very young and you have a long way ahead of you. And it is ok if one day or longer, you are confused and lost. Be patient with yourself. And if you look from far away and with a fresh perspective you see, despite of difficulties bothering you, many possibilities and choices which will come on your path. 
But first thing, be kinder and more compassionate with yourself, give yourself time, find or create a support network of people who can help you mentally and emotionally and be open to what world brings to you on this long and unexpected journey of life.

"Very understandable my friend.   


Life isn't easy and no one gives you a manual or much guidance. Parents do their best, but they are just as lost as we are, just a little bit further down the road.  


I recommend mapping out your key problems. See what beliefs are affecting you and holding you back, and then question those beliefs heavily. It's often better if you have someone else do it, but they have to just question and not give advice.  You can also use chat GPT.   


One core belief, that I myself have suffered from is thinking I'm a piece of shit. Which if we really think about the statement, there's no way either of us are stinky smelly brown turds that  should be flushed down the toilet. 

&#x200B;

So Step 1 - Identify and map key problems

Step 2 - Identify the beliefs that underly those problems. 

Step 3 - Question those beliefs heavily

Step 4 - Identify the new beliefs that are more constructive and true

Step 5 - Come up with solutions to those problems and execute on them

&#x200B;

You were going to be an engineer so I believe you have the mind to get through this and come up with solutions to your problems.

Life is more like: school, one college, maybe finish, maybe not, a job, another job, a different kind of job, meet someone, have kids, or not, buy a house, or not, separate, meet someone else, or not, change careers again, rinse and repeat. 

The american dream that people are still chasing wasn't like that either.

I‚Äôm about to be a senior in high school and I‚Äôve never felt more lonely then ever. I wished a had someone that would give me a hug and tell me everything is ok but I have no one to do that. Maybe it‚Äôs my fault, maybe I‚Äôm to weird or maybe people think I‚Äôm a loser. I just wish I was a better person.	pjthejetsfan	post	16.020003744507555	male	White	0.9966302514076233	na	na	na	2	selfhelp
"I might not be there physically but I'd like to give you a virtual hug ü§óü§ó

And truly everything is going to be okay. Trust me high school is hard for everyone. There was one year in highschool that I had no friends in my lunch and I ended up eating alone. There were a few people in my class who knew but I didn't consider friends. After eating alone for a while I worked up the courage to ask if I could sit with them. It felt humiliating at first but they ended up saving me a spot.

No matter what class you're in I'm assuming throughout your day there are one to two people that you are acquaintances with. Try and get to know them better. They might not become your best friends but you'll have people you can hang out with. 

Find people that have similar hobbies. Do you play a sport, draw, watch movies/anime, know a second language? If you do join an after school club. There you can meet kids who have the same interests as you and bond over it.

And if all else fails you are in your senior year. Once that over life will get a whole lot better I promise. When I went to college that was the first time I ever had a large group of friends. Maybe you'll go to college or start a job and you'll meet so many new people. Just hang in there. Life gets a whole lot better.

"I used to have baaaaaad social anxiety. I really don't know how it went away slowly. 

I normally start with a good comment about them. Something like clothes, backpack, maybe handwriting, something they say. Then I start making questions related to that.
If they have a graphic shirt about a band or TV show that you like definitely start with that :)
Sometimes I use an avatar t-shirt when I know I'm going to a social event where I don't know many people and 2 out of 3 times end up talking to a lot of people that tell me they like my t-shirt.

Hey all,

I‚Äôm generally pretty happy with who I am and what I‚Äôm doing, but I have these big dreams I want to be working towards, and I think my lack of discipline and organization is getting in the way of them. I have so many projects and hobbies and things I want to learn, and they all distract from and complicate eachother. I‚Äôm also an avid day dreamer and have trouble keeping track of and following through on ideas.

I‚Äôm looking for some systems for organization/productivity/habits/goals that have helped people structure their lives and make baby steps towards getting better. I‚Äôm familiar with GTD, but want to know if anyone has any systems, tips, or tricks in the way of structuring your life in a way that moves you towards your goals.

Sorry if that‚Äôs a vague question, but any and all input is appreciated."	Space_Cadet_Tyler	post	22.008250284545955	male	White	0.06844744086265564	na	na	na	5	selfhelp

"In the morning light, we rise, Beneath the warmth of tranquil skies, Down the stairs, we slowly tread, Leaving behind the sleep-touched bed.

We turn the music, soft and low, Let the calm through our spirits flow, A conscious choice, a mindful way, To usher in the newborn day.

Through the rush and frantic haste, We find a moment's Peace embraced, For in this quiet, sacred space, We give our thoughts their rightful place.

Thank you, pain, for lessons learned, Thank you, scars, from battles earned, In each thought, both bright and bleak, Lies strength untold and wisdom meek.

We do not shun the shadows cast, Instead, we thank them for the past, For even in the darkest night, We find the will, the strength, the light.

Into the day, with heart set free, Embracing life's sweet mystery, With gratitude, we navigate, The turns of chance, the twists of fate.

In each decision, small and grand, We seek the self, the truth unplanned, With clarity and purpose found, In gratitude, we are unbound.

Each morning thus, we sow the seeds, Of gratitude for life's small deeds, In each thought thanked, in each feeling seen, We find the joy in life's routine.

As dawn breaks forth, we choose to be, In quiet strength and reverie, In the end, it's clear to see, Gratitude's path to harmony."	Other_Rhubarb_7579	post	41.947048221744	female	White	0.0011846190318465233	na	na	na	2	selfhelp

"Alright so... as a person who once did similar things as you in terms of your approach to people, here's my 2 cents:

The reason you're having this issue is because, on some level, you don't trust that people will actually tell you if they don't like something you're proposing. In both examples, you're operating as if you need to preemptively halt yourself from doing something that could potentially cause pain to others and/or make them resent you. 

In the process, though, you're actually doing people a disservice. For example: in the first situation, you've made a request to your girlfriend, and her answer has - per your wording - ALWAYS been ""yes!"" And yet you stop yourself because in spite of what she said, you choose not to believe the words coming out of her mouth for fear that she actually does not want you to do the thing she said she's ok with. I imagine the same is true with other people in your life, where you may want to do some activity, and yet if they say ""yes, we'll do that activity as well"" you''ll think, ""no, they don't want to do that thing, they're just doing it out of pity.""

I will give you the honest truth about over-coming this kind of thing: on some level, you never do. In my case, I still have times when I feel odd asking for help, or making a request to do something I want to do. And yet, I'm still able to do it. Why? Because I made a decision, which was this: I have to trust that the people in my life have their own autonomy, and can speak for themselves. And it is not my job to feel any kind of way about a decision they made for themselves. So, if I suggest doing an activity and they say ""yes,"" I have to assume they want to do that thing, and that if they didn't, they would tell me. Why? Because they would also expect me to do the same, and our friendship/relationship isn't contingent on if either of us says ""yes"" to the other one all the time.

Basically, over time I collected more evidence than not that people usually mean ""yes"" when they say ""yes."" But you never get to that point if you don't practice it. You have to make a request, or a hang out decision, and then shut up and wait for the other person to answer... and if it's in the affirmative, you have to just say, ""well, great, let's do it"" and go with the notion that, for this moment in time, you're going to choose to believe their ""yes.""

Lastly, I think what also helped was realizing that, for people who care about you, it's actually MORE annoying when they say ""yes"" and you try to backpedal. And also, all relationship are reciprocal, meaning if you do for your friends/girlfriend, it's in our nature to WANT to give back to you in kind. And when you reject it, things don't stay balanced and start to feel off in those relationships. Just some things to consider."

So I'm in high school, and I have band camp starting in a few weeks. It's an all-day camp (9am-5pm). The problem is, my sleep cycle has been uber-fucked. I end up falling asleep at 6am ish and waking up at around noon. PLEASE SOMEONE HEEELP!!	SfTrOeNeE	post	-12.849036252957383	male	White	0.9994603991508484	na	na	na	5	selfhelp
And do you play/use your phone until 6? If so, yes you know the answer. Stop your phone usage an hour before your sleep time. And yeah there's no way around it, you gotta force the new sleep schedule onto you... Spend some sleepless nights and yet wake up in the morning no matter how long your sleep was. You'll end up sleepy the whole day for a week or so but you could use that to your advantage by sleeping early now that you're drowsy the whole day. If you ain't able to fall asleep, DO NOT TOUCH YOUR PHONE OR ANY SCREEN tbh. Just try to cease your thoughts and focus on your breathe... You'll fall asleep before you realize	SfTrOeNeE	reply	na	na	na	0.9994603991508484	no	no	strong	na	selfhelp
"Hey there! Don't worry; many people struggle with their sleep cycle sometimes. It's common, especially during high school with varying schedules and activities. To fix your sleep schedule before band camp, consider making gradual adjustments to your bedtime. Try going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier each night until you reach a suitable bedtime that allows you to wake up at 9 am for the all-day camp from 9 am to 5 pm.  
  
Consistency is key, so aim to set a specific wake-up time every day, including weekends. By doing so, you can regulate your body's internal clock, making it easier to fall asleep and wake up at the desired times. This might take some time to get used to, but your body will adjust eventually.  
  
Another essential tip is to limit your screen time before bedtime. The blue light emitted by electronic devices can disrupt your sleep patterns. Consider avoiding phones, computers, or TV at least an hour before you plan to sleep. Instead, use that time to engage in a calming bedtime routine, such as reading, meditating, or taking a warm bath. These activities can help signal your body that it's time to wind down and prepare for sleep.  
  
Be mindful of your caffeine intake, especially in the afternoon and evening. Consuming caffeine too late in the day can interfere with falling asleep, so try to avoid it during those hours.  
  
Physical activity during the day can help improve your sleep quality at night. However, avoid intense workouts close to bedtime, as they might leave you too energized to sleep.  
  
Ensure that your bedroom is conducive to sleep. Keep the environment cool, dark, and quiet to promote restful sleep.  
  
Lastly, try relaxation techniques like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation if you find it challenging to calm your mind before sleep.  
  
Remember, adjusting your sleep cycle takes time, so be patient with yourself. Stick to your routine, and your sleep pattern should gradually improve before band camp. Good luck, and I hope you have a fantastic time at the camp! üòä"	SfTrOeNeE	reply	na	na	na	0.9994603991508484	weak	strong	no	na	selfhelp

"Hello Friends, let me tell you about a self-help technique called journaling. Journaling is the practice of writing every single day. You can practically write about anything you want. You can write about your emotions, you can plan out your day, you can philosophize about life. Journaling is an ancient technique, a perfect example of this is Marcus Aurelius's journal, his Meditations. The stoics used to have different practices and methods to make the most out of their journaling sessions, and they included different excersizes like writng about the finitude of life, writing about their values, and reflecting on their days and what they can do to be better the next day.

I have been experimenting with journaling for years and I wanted to share with you the outline I use to start and end my days and my weeks which keeps me sane, organized, focused, confident, and in harmony with my goals and motivations. Here it is:

\- Start by mentioning 5 things I like, appreciate, love, and admire about myself.

\- Then appreciate 3 things I am thankful for.

\- Write down my short term goals (1 month to 6 months).

\- Write down my medium term goals (6 months to 5 years).

\- Write down my long term goals (5years forward). The idea is that my there should be little fluctuation specially in my medium and long term goals.

\- Plan out my day in google calendar.

\- Space to write about personal things troubling me.

\- If Monday, plan my workload for the week. Once I make a plan, I cannot change it for the week.

\- If Sunday, analyze this weeks workload and think about changes and improvements for the following week.

\- Night

\- Write down 3 things I did right today.

\- Write down 3 things I could do better.

\- Write down 3 things I am thankful for.

\- Thank God.

I recommend you try my outline for a week or two and then tell me what you think about it! I would love to hear your experiences.

Good luck to you all,

Ivan Berezin"	RealIvanB	post	19.919636927092323	male	White	0.0013643422862514853	na	na	na	1	selfhelp

"As I'm reaching my mid 30's, I'm meeting more and more people my age who feel like they missed out on their 20's and that now it's 'too late' for them. I see this with career, fitness & sex and dating. As a life coach I've heard from people in their 30's, 40's and 50's saying ""it's too late for me"". I've even heard some (respectfully) dumbass 20 yr olds saying it's too late for them and now they don't know if they'll ever 'make it' because they've spent too long doing the opposite. Let me say this right now you're absolutely fucking wrong.

Your life is your life, it doesn't matter what the fuck someone else is doing, or how old some other person is. Also keep in mind that at every age milestone someone a decade older will wish they're your age.

So now I'll talk to all the people 30 and above, who feeling like they've missed the boat because you're too old and your 'prime years' in your 20's have passed. You have an advantage that the people in their 20's don't have. You have insecurity. You have that feeling of dread or impending doom that you have missed your golden opportunities in life to set up your foundations for the future. Yes, I get it doesn't feel good, I was there at 28. I had a breakdown because up until that point I'd been skinny and then fat, only ever had a few abusive girlfriends and was working a shitty part time job that couldn't pay the bills. I was terrified of becoming an old man that would die with regret.

The fear that: I'd hit my 30's and be old and dried up, was the **_best_** motivation I could ever have. It means I busted my ass for 6-12 months and got my shit together.

The insecurity means you'll try so much harder because you can look at your wasted time, look at your age and use that as the _biggest_ motivator to kick your ass into gear.

No matter how much a 20 something yr old tries, they can never feel that same feeling, that FOMO, the worry that your ship has sailed.

If you don't believe that it's possible for you to turn things around now you're 30+ you need to go out and find people that are your age or older that have turned their lives around. Find the story of the obese mother that had spent her entire life unfit and unhealthy and turned it all around so she could look after her kids. Find the stories of the guy that started yet another business venture after struggling for years to finally strike gold, find the 40 yr old virgin who found the love of his life and got married. Find anyone to prove yourself wrong. There'll be a tonne of subreddits out there with success stories that will apply to what you want.

If you haven't gotten what you want out of life yet, change your sob story and find evidence that you CAN do it Your past doesn't need to dictate your future. Draw a line in the sand and say: _""That was the past, but that is going to fucking change. I WILL make my \[30's, 40's, 50's\] the best decade of my life.""_

That's exactly what I did at 28. Those were the last 2 years of my 20's and I went on blind faith that it would get better. And then I went out there, hit the gym, lost weight, fixed my style, met a tonne of women and started my business.

You need to be playing to win, because if you keep repeating to yourself: ""I can't because I'm 30+ yrs old, it's too late for me "" you will make that happen. The universe won't hand you what you want in life, YOU need to make it happen. Crying about your past will only punish the current and future version of yourself. What does that achieve? By repeating your limiting beliefs you curse yourself to a doomed future.

If you missed out on your 20's go out there and change your future. Because if you don't make the most of your time right now you'll just have another decade of regret and misery."	LimeRevolutionary184	post	30.692326627102045	male	White	0.005462646484375	na	na	na	1	selfhelp

I know that those days seems far away from where you are now but once you get though college (assuming you don't have an option) you will be free to discover what makes you happy."

"I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed and discouraged by your academic journey in engineering. It's tough when you feel pressure from your parents and comparisons to academically successful cousins. It's essential to remember that academic success is not the only measure of your worth as a person. Everyone has their unique strengths and interests, and it's okay to explore different paths.  
  
If you're no longer passionate about engineering and feel drawn to culinary arts, consider discussing your feelings openly with your parents. Explain to them how important this career choice is to you and how it aligns with your true passions. Sometimes, parents might have expectations for their children based on their own experiences or beliefs, but it's crucial to communicate your desires and aspirations.  
  
Remember, it's never too late to change your path and pursue what truly makes you happy. Seek out support from friends, family, or a counselor who can understand your feelings and provide encouragement. Setting small achievable goals can help you build confidence and take steps towards your new career path.  
  
It's normal to face challenges in life, and failures are a part of learning and growing. Don't be too hard on yourself for past academic setbacks. Instead, focus on what you can do now to move forward and embrace a new direction that brings you joy and fulfillment.  
  
Lastly, if you ever feel overwhelmed or have thoughts of self-harm, reach out to a mental health professional or a helpline immediately. Remember that you are valued, and there are people who care and want to support you through difficult times. You have the strength to navigate through challenges and find your own path to happiness and success."	Electrical-Eye-7323	reply	na	na	na	0.9993993043899536	weak	no	no	na	selfhelp

I try to meditate, work, exercise, study, learn a language, listen to music, watch a show, or listen to podcast everyday

im still missing that ""Fun"" thing. i know that isn't porn or sexting. im finding it hard to find out what i want, is it friends? no, GF? no.. i think my thoughts have made me believe that ""Friends or GF or porn"" would be the solution to my Problems but i know they aren't. 

I only know i know that i want to be better. Learning about Critical thinking, Psychology, Space, Ancient Civilizations, Observational skills, Time Management, Conversations.. Many more. do i work on these one by one? Most of these are ""Mental work"" do these count as goals? 

Always basing my self worth on how others react. i think i was afraid of opening my messages because i messaged so many girls i was afraid of ""Being Ignored, or one line replies"" i think i was afraid because then i would base my self worth/personality on those replies. 

but i opened the replies anyways. i dont know what to base my self worth on.

"Welcome to the world of emotional maturity. As kids, we did not have enough analytical capacity, so we learned about ourselves by observing reactions on us from others. Now you are on a journey of self-discovery. The more you know who you are about yourself, the less you need or reply to other people's opinions or reactions. Here is a list of questions to explore who you are and enhance your self-worth:

What are my strengths, and how do they contribute positively to my life and the lives of others?

How do I handle mistakes or failures, and do I allow them to define my self-worth?

What are my core values, and how well am I aligning my actions with them?

How do I practice self-compassion and treat myself kindly during challenging times?

What achievements or progress am I proud of, and how do they reflect my capabilities and determination?

Do I set healthy boundaries with others, and how do I prioritize my well-being and needs?

Am I comfortable with expressing my authentic self, including my vulnerabilities and imperfections?

How do I practice self-care, and do I prioritize my physical and emotional well-being?

What negative self-talk or limiting beliefs do I need to challenge to improve my self-image?

How do I view failures or setbacks, and do I see them as opportunities for growth and learning?

How do I choose the people I surround myself with, and do they uplift and support me?

Do I tend to seek external validation for my self-worth, and how can I rely more on internal validation?

What activities or hobbies bring me joy and fulfillment, and how do they contribute to my self-worth?

How do I handle criticism or feedback, and do I differentiate between constructive input and personal attacks?

How do I show gratitude for the positive aspects of my life, and how does gratitude impact my self-worth?

The point is that if you write it down, then your brain process it in a different way. Anyway I'm not sure if it will solve your problem completely, especially that I'm rather shit myself in terms of personal life and not the best advisor. What I know is that by forcing yourself to do stuff you get better at it - so perhaps this could help too? I used to be afraid of blood and became a blood donor for the sake of stopping being scared. If you force yourself to do whatever you want to do, then it becomes easier or even natural with time.	Butcher__1	reply	na	na	na	0.01465596817433834	no	strong	no	na	selfhelp
"I think you're on the right track with meditating, but it seems like you're probably trying to force it. I'm not sure what, if anything, you're meditating on, but I recommend that you make it more about mindfulness. So instead of having a specific goal for your meditation, just observe your feelings, your thoughts, and whatever else comes up. Do not judge them, just notice them and let them pass. Only go for 5-10 minutes at a time to begin with and if it begins to feel too much like work, then stop. When 5-10 minutes begins to feel too fast, then add time as needed. Try guided meditation too, it helps quiet the mind sometimes.

Related to meditation, you can practice not holding onto outcomes. Example: you want to learn to paint. You have a picture in mind that you want to paint. You begin to paint, but you don't stress about how the painting is turning out. You notice when you make mistakes, and remind yourself that your goal was to paint, not paint a perfect picture. Eventually you complete your painting, and it's got lots of errors. You remind yourself that you have not failed; you've actually succeeded! You painted a painting and have therefore made progress. Again: don't hold onto outcomes.

Work on your self talk, I'm sure that's not pretty for you. Be nice to yourself. My life coach had me do an exercise that I HATED at first, it made me so uncomfortable: 3-4 times a day when you see yourself in the mirror, give yourself a high five. 

Bottom line is to give yourself some grace, and do more observing and celebrating small victories, less judging and micromanaging yourself."	Butcher__1	reply	na	na	na	0.01465596817433834	no	no	no	na	selfhelp

I have recently been struggling for motivation and am just hoping somebody can help. So a bit of context, I'm a 26 year old male and have been to uni (it didn't go well) and am now stuck working in a dead end job with no future career plans. I struggle to meet people and am still living at home with my family. I am looking at my future now (I.E doing my driving lessons, trying to come up with some sort of career plan). Now though, I just feel lost and like i've left everything too late. I'll be mid aged before I know it and really struggle to meet people already. By then my worry is i'll just be old, lonely, miserable and boring. Can someone please help?

"It begins with our thinking and feeling. Be willing to release negativity and express love/positivity and constructive attitudes like kindness, forgiveness, gratitude, etc. Apply this to yourself and everyone you think of - no grudges, envy and unforgiveness. These limit us if we hold on to them.

Practicng this lifestyle opens us op to receive inspiration and creativity, which stems from our clarity. We are no longer blocking our energy with negativity that clutters our mind.

How we think and feel influences how we perceive life and the decisions we make. A positive/loving/peaceful person sees more opportunities and have more energy than a negative/unloving person."	Arnoutovhere	reply	na	na	na	0.9804563522338867	no	no	no	na	selfhelp
"What are the problems you think are most pressing now? Making new friends and future career? Making new friends is a skill anyone can learn, for some its natural, others need to learn. Pretty sure there are many videos on youtube on how to make friends and your local library will most likely have some resources too. So read books, watch videos and then practice. It can be done, I can assure you, I was in your shoes once.   

I envy you in a way because at least you have a job. I haven't worked in 1.5 years, had to go on welfare 6 months ago and I'm trying to figure out what to do, the pressure/stress is immense. I already changed my career twice in my life and now I think I need to find something else, which is super hard at my age but I say to myself that the worst thing I can do to myself is give up. So I browse through Etsy to see if there is a craft I would enjoy doing, you don't necessariliy need to go to college to learn a new skill, you need to find what you like and it may take time. I'm subscribed to r/crafts and similar subs, I browse through lists of occupations to see what I may find attractive etc. Keep looking and you will find some occupation that you will enjoy. Also don't compare yourself to others, it's a sure way to being depressed, everyone's situation is different, so what if you live with your family, sooner or later you will be able to have your own place, just try to stay positive, look through subs like r/malelivingspace and imagine yourself having a place to yourself in the future, project a positive future for yourself."

As I said making new friends or finding someone to date is a skill that can be learned.

Imo its well worth the investment but don't expect quick results, and don't expect magic, they are just guides, all the work has to be done by you.

Whenever im not working I'm extremely competitive in whatever game im deciding to play and those goals I had are just gone because its just something I cant obtain. 

I have a loving (long distance) girlfriend that i have been with for a long time now - shes my everything but i cant help but feeling like im fucking something up there too. I feel isoloated from my own friends ive had for many years

I do have a college degree but im not even sure if thats a passion of mine anymore or if I got it to please my family. Honestly I dont even know whats a passion of mine anymore.

Why do I feel stuck?
I dont have any goals - with the exception of seeing my girlfriend again 
I dont have any hobbies - other than wasting time with games I feel I'm horrible at
I dont have any passion

Take it from me, I've been in this game for a loooong time, and you can be as decidcated and disciplined as you want, you can work as hard and smart as you want, a lot of factors in life still simply comes down to coincidences, timimg, and luck.

And the worst kind of feedback, is the ""you're overqualified"" feedback and other BULLSHIT responses!

So yeah, the clock is 6:30 PM and I'm still drinking my morning coffee because I have a horrible day rythm these days.

That's what happens when you don't have job to go to anymore, it messes up your normal day rythm alot even though I started my own businesses and startet to work for myself. There's little to none activity these days.

That's why I decided years ago to invest heavily to become financially free one day because working for others is a complete joke either way. 

I'm sick and tired of people literally ruining my life because THEY have a complete different perspective even though I am willing and cooperative and could care less about the type of position.

I even remember one job process where I was the only one qualified and they still went with someone else. Complete joke!

You just come to the point that the only thing you are focused on is showing up and hoping you get the green light because no matter what you do is useless anyway."	TorbjornLvl3Turret	reply	na	na	na	0.9993769526481628	weak	strong	no	na	selfhelp

I mean your schoolwork. Do you miss quizzes because you don‚Äôt care about your grades/school, or because you forget they exist, or do you not care to even try and remember your quizzes?? Or do you care about your grades and are simply too exhausted to do the work? Your answer is simple. Figure out if you even care. If you care, you would do your homework. If you‚Äôre not doing it, either you don‚Äôt care, or you have an underlying problem. Assuming you do care, the fact that you can‚Äôt motivate yourself to complete routine schoolwork speaks to an underlying issue.

I do recognize my grade is important, and studying for quizzes will help drastically in my quiz mark and exam marks. I did well studying and preparing uptil the halfway point of the course.

Im studying to get into a program i hope I will enjoy and be a good match for me.  This specific class(anatomy&physiology) just has an overwhelming amount of content and detail. I try to fake interest sometimes! And I tried to recognize I need a good mark in this class to push myself to study hard. But half way through this course, i maybe just got burnt out and struggled to keep up that high amount of effort. I wish I could just have a few weeks off to rest and regain myself. I do agree that finding interest in the content makes it eaiser! Did you ever try to trick yourself or force your brain to find enjoyment in your studies?

"# Examples of the kind of thoughts I'm talking about:

I like to call these ""crazy"" thoughts and many of them come from my OCD but I believe that normal people do get a handful of these too so it shouldn't be too hard to understand.

Thoughts like plugging in your charger, turning it on, leaving the room then wondering things like, ""Did I plug it in correctly?"", ""What if it didn't slot in perfectly?"", ""What if it's leaning on one side and slowly gets out on its own?"".

But I assume these methods (or the ones that you guys say are the best) should and would work against other troublesome thoughts and not just this kind.

&#x200B;

There five ways to deal with these troublesome thoughts which I've heard of and they contradict each other.

# 1 - Reject the thought (by suppressing it I suppose)

People who are against this method say that the thought would come back stronger and that this is not a permanent solution.

&#x200B;

# 2 - Observe the thought

Told to me by many people who reduced their troublesome OCD thoughts, like the ones I get. People who meditate recommend this as well.

I currently ""observe"" my thoughts by attaching a tag to them that just lets my mind know that I've observed it. It still manages to come back sometimes.

&#x200B;

# 3 - Reject (from 1) and replace the thought with something else

I recently heard of this method and haven't used it much.

&#x200B;

# 4 - Snap a rubber band on your wrist

I've been using this one a lot recently and I'm not sure if it's a good way to go about things.

&#x200B;

# 5 - 5-4-3-2-1 Method

This is a method from a book I've been reading and I'm a bit skeptical, you're supposed to count downwards from 5 and then change what you were thinking about, this supposedly gives you control. I'm not sure if following this is a good thing because it sounds like the Reject method to me and that method (the Reject method) is often criticized for suppressing thoughts.

&#x200B;

# 6? Just deal with it

Almost always ends up in a headache, I end up with this a lot because I switch between these methods and rarely ever fully follow through with one because I just keep doubting its efficacy, it would be nice if someone would just put an end to this madness by explaining whether all these methods are good or not.

# What should I do?

All of these different methods make me worried too because I might reject the thought because that was the first thing that came to my mind and try to undo it and try to observe the thought instead, this just adds extra worry while these methods were supposed to help me.

&#x200B;

Since these methods are so contradictory, I worry that using one over the other may or may not be setting me back in progress, this is all very worrying, could someone please tell me if all these methods are good and if they aren't, which ones should I strictly avoid?

&#x200B;

If you can, please also explain how to do the method, I still don't get how to ""observe"" my thoughts and it would be nice to know if I was doing it right. Maybe a simple test that I could do to know if it worked?

&#x200B;

Hi. For a while now I have this painful feeling of guilt whenever I say no to my parent. I don't have problem saying no when my friends ask me if I want to do something or even my partner. I have an amazing relationship with my parents and they are one of the best people I have ever met. They are like angels on earth. This feeling started to be much bigger problem when my dad got diagnosed with cancer. Sadly, he passed away a few months ago and today my mom asked me when will come to visit, even though I visited her 3 weeks ago. I don't live close, about 80 kilometers away and sometimes I feel so drained from work that I only want to spend the weekend with my partner at home. Today for the first time I told my mom I don't feel well and that I am very stressed so if it's not a big deal I won't come to see her this weekend. She said it's fine and just continued the chat normally, no big feelings. I just can't stop cying beacuse I can't stop thinking I am selfish, even though I know very well I do so much for her, we talk every day, she is my best friend and I am hers. And I know she doesn't hold it against me. I just cant stop this feeling. When my dad was still alive there were days when I would beat myself over the fact I said ''omg I am so happy today, this is such a good day and I don't want it to end''. And in that very second another thoght would enter my mind saying how can I be happy when he is literally fighing for his life. He couldn't eat due to his illness and somedays I would eat something yummy and just stop in the middle of a meal beacuse this overwhelming guilt occured that I can eat and enjoy and he can't. What is happening and how do I stop this feeling? I love my parents so much but this fu\*\*ing feeling is eating me alive.	tra-tin-ci-ca	post	18.747885435049515	male	White	0.9889979958534241	na	na	na	2	selfhelp

More than likely you feel this way because you feel like you can't be there for her when she needs you.

"My man, take this from someone who got out of depression, constant self doubt and overactive nervous system. Acceptance in depression is good, if you accept your emotions, your past and your life situation. Only if you quit resisting you can process the emotions. If you accept the depression itself though, it's game over because how are you going to heal if you don't have the motivation anymore? Don't give up. Depression is a bitch but there's always a light at the end of the tunnel.

Actually I wrote a post last month about healing from depression, step by step. There's a 100 things you can try but some are more effective before the other.

"You're 20, which is basically getting to the end of the tutorial of life. You're not late and life isn't ""nearly over"" as some people seem to think. You're just getting started.

Figuring out what you want is hard.

The truth is:

Life is completely meaningless, until YOU decide what meaning to give to it.

Many people live lives of quiet desperation because they never went through the process of figuring out what their meaning for life is. They just go through the motions, because thinking about it is painful and difficult.

You're gonna need to have some difficult conversations with yourself. 

Ask questions like:

* What does a day or a week of my dream life look like?
* What is something that is fun to me but feels like hard work for most people? Can I turn that into a career?
* If success at anything was guaranteed, what would you decide to do?
* What if failure was guaranteed, meaning you getno tangible result from your efforts (the work you do is the only thing). What would you do then?
* What traits do you value most in other people? What about yourself? Do you have them?
* What are your goals for your finances? Relationships? Love life? Health? Career? Lifestyle? 

My suggestion would be to sit down and write out your answers to these (and other) questions to the best of your abilities. There aren't any right and wrong answers, and they will shift as you grow older and wiser. But it does give you a starting point.

Secondly:

After you have been through the process, go through your answers and ask yourself why the thing you wrote down is important to you. Do the same with the answer you give to that question and repeat it a few times. (Google the Trail of Whys).

That will help you get more clarity on your core desires.

Don't expect to figure this out overnight. You won't. This is gonna be one of the most (if not the most) difficult things you will ever do in your life. But also one of the most critical.

Hope that helps!

"I think the video might be oversimplifying the nuances of our workflows and workflow management. When we only have one or two projects to handle, simple time blocking may be sufficient. But when we start handling many simultaneous projects at various states of completion, time blocking alone isn‚Äôt enough to provide structure to our workflow. 

In these instances, it‚Äôs important to list out and define projects including associated tasks completed and next actionable steps.

I.

Suddenly, I realize that I‚Äôll never have the relationship that I wanted with my mother.  As long as she was alive, even though I‚Äôd never admit it, a part of me, the stupidest and most wicked part of me was still holding on to that chance. The chance of me having a normal life and a normal mental state. It was all useless now. I‚Äôve been seeking female validation for years, I‚Äôve been attached to female teachers for as long as I can remember and it‚Äôs been draining me. Piece by piece, each and every moment, pieces of me were falling down like dried leaves in the autumn were falling off trees. My mother was never there for me. 

At school, I go just to see her. I see her as my mother, she‚Äôs the person who gives me comfort and who I feel like I can confide in, even though I've never actually talked to her about it. A teacher can give me enough reasons to keep me going until next week. The cycle goes on. It‚Äôs been going on for years. Yet, I decide to suffer in silence because the trust issues I have developed over the years make I think nobody can be trusted, so I bottle up my emotions. The bottle eventually becomes full and it explodes. That‚Äôs the moment when I‚Äôm desperately trying to find a person to talk to. Nothing. As always, nobody is ever there for me. I start cutting.  

‚ÄúWhy would you do that to yourself?‚Äù It feels like you‚Äôre drowning and that blade throws a rope in the water which you could hold on to. You hold on it so tightly that you start developing scars, you don‚Äôt care about them as the only thing you‚Äôre trying to do is to survive. It‚Äôs the same with self-harm. The only thing I‚Äôm trying to do when I‚Äôm not with the person I‚Äôm attached to is to survive. I just want to feel something as most of the time I simply feel numb. I‚Äôm happy I finally feel something except‚Ä¶well, nothing. I‚Äôm only kept alive by two things: my teacher and my blade. For as long as I can remember, I‚Äôve felt‚Ä¶empty.

At school, I‚Äôm full of energy, others describe me as a social butterfly, someone who has no social anxiety, someone that is full of life. In the bathroom I cut, but that‚Äôs alright, I‚Äôll wipe the blood away, all my other wounds have hardened and regenerated into new skin. While some disappear as fast as they came, others leave a scar. A girl comes to me and asks what I am doing, with a shocked look on her face. She could see my scars.

‚Äú I can cover them with the skin colored pigment I put on my face.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù she asks.

‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt want people to see. To see how hard I‚Äôve worked with nothing to show for it. All the pain I‚Äôve endured without any reward. Everyone asks me why I have scars on my hands and the answer lingers in my throat. Everyone thinks it‚Äôs just a lump. However, that lump is more than 15 years of hidden failure I cannot bear to tell anyone about. So I smile, and keep my mouth shut. I beat my face with powder to dry out last night‚Äôs tears. I wear clothes big enough to fit my despair, but the only wicked thing I cannot hide are those‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúScars‚Ä¶?‚Äù she wonders

‚ÄúScars.‚Äù I eventually reply.

I cry, bitterly. Knowing she won‚Äôt ever be able to understand my true feelings.  It‚Äôs alright though, it has always been this way. This was just another one of the daily conversations I have when people find out about my scars.  
 

Suddenly, she hugs me tight, so tight that I can barely breathe. However, I found a sort of comfort in that hug, something I have never felt in many years. So I don‚Äôt budge, I remain still, not knowing how to react in front of her. Maybe‚Ä¶she understood? I doubt it. She was one of the beautiful girls, someone who could kill me with her beauty. She probably has everything going her way in life, someone with the ‚Äúpretty privilege‚Äù couldn‚Äôt have it hard in life‚Ä¶right?   
 

She starts sobbing with me, while still holding onto my body. She explains how she is scarred too‚Ä¶ But the only difference is that you can‚Äôt physically see her scars, they are on the inside. She couldn‚Äôt cut, she doesn‚Äôt have what she calls ‚Äúcold blood‚Äù. She couldn‚Äôt and still can‚Äôt bear the sight of blood. Her way to cope with things is painting and drawing, she can express herself through art. Her paintings tell more than any words could.  
 

‚ÄúYou know, some words can cut deeper than blades can, some words are so sharp, that they leave a scar on one‚Äôs heart, deep enough that it never heals. Whenever you touch it, it bleeds.‚Äù She whispers to me softly, pulling away from the hug.   
 

I stare at her, wiping away the tears from my face. She was right, of course. But how could she possibly know? Did she‚Ä¶go through the same misery as I did? Is her life not‚Ä¶as perfect as it seemed..?  
 

‚ÄúMy name is Stephanie. I‚Äôll give you my phone number. Text me whenever you want, I‚Äôll be there for you. I know you may not believe me‚Ä¶but I‚Äôll help you. I will. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶you need to want to be helped too. I won‚Äôt leave you. I understand you more than others do. We can help each other through the misery of life.‚Äù She says in a soothing voice.  
 

I look down while I‚Äôm talking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too consumed with my own life, I can‚Äôt help you. I don‚Äôt think you can help me either. Sharing my heart‚Ä¶it‚Äôs tearing me apart. I will break completely.‚Äù  
 

‚ÄúThat is where you‚Äôre wrong. You‚Äôre scarred on the inside and outside‚Ä¶ Unfortunately, the scars on the outside can‚Äôt be helped, but I can apply a soothing balm to the ones on the inside. You won‚Äôt understand, but in time, having someone to talk to, a person who you know you can trust, it will help. It‚Äôll be a slow process, but I have faith. We *can* help each other.‚Äù Stephanie says.

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I get her phone number, and I go home, thinking about what happened. For some reason, she was so pretty, that everything she said‚Ä¶seemed right..? It‚Äôs a weird feeling. I know she‚Äôd be my friend only, nothing else, however, deep down‚Ä¶ I want her to be *more* than that.   
 

Weeks pass, me and Stephanie were growing closer and closer. She did in fact help me, I was one month clean because of her. The way she just simply looked at me with those eyes‚Ä¶ it could make me melt in seconds. There was something about her‚Ä¶so attractive. I kept those feelings to myself though.  
 

‚ÄúIs something wrong? I feel like there‚Äôs something you‚Äôre not telling me‚Ä¶ Are you okay‚Ä¶?‚Äù Stephanie says in her soothing voice, as usual.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶um. No‚Ä¶nothing‚Ä¶it‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs nothing wrong‚Äù I stutter.   
 

‚ÄúCome on, I know that there‚Äôs something going on in that mind of yours‚Äù  
 

Her voice was so calming‚Ä¶I started blushing profusely. I couldn‚Äôt keep it in any longer.

‚ÄúI like you, Steph. I‚Äôm not sure why or how, but I had feelings for you from the moment I saw you.‚Äù  
 

‚ÄúAh! Um‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm happy you felt safe enough to share that with me. I‚Äôm also happy to tell you that the feeling is mutual. You‚Äôre such an innocent girl, so beautiful‚Ä¶ the world doesn‚Äôt deserve you. It left you with scars, you had to bear them by yourself this whole time.‚Äù  
 

‚ÄúYour words‚Ä¶they are so soothing, I suppose this is the universe‚Äôs way of saying *I‚Äôm sorry*‚Äú I say in a breaking voice.

She pulls me in and gently pressed her lips onto mine. The connection we have, it‚Äôs something special. Something I have never had before. I truly love her. She understands me, sees me, calms me, and‚Ä¶ loves me‚Ä¶perhaps. 

‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù Stephanie breaks the kiss and caresses my face. I wish this moment would last forever, my whole life turned for the better. How could a girl so perfect, love a broken girl like me‚Ä¶ How could the universe have pity on me, after all these years of suffering? I don‚Äôt know the answers to these questions, but I don‚Äôt even care. As long as I‚Äôm with her, I‚Äôm sure everything will be alright.  
 

The moment doesn‚Äôt last. Reality hits me. She must want something‚Ä¶right? She‚Äôs probably also using me, just like the other people in my life. There is absolutely no way‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of things I wanted to say when I met you, but you know how I can be‚Ä¶ *and if you choose to be with someone, why would you ever choose to be with me?* I‚Äôm sorry, I mean‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not, I mean‚Ä¶I wish you couldn‚Äôt tell. I‚Äôm sorry, I mean‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not, I mean‚Ä¶maybe for you I fell, maybe I‚Äôm still falling‚Ä¶? But I didn‚Äôt say that at first. Instead, I‚Äôm sorry, I mean I‚Äôm not, I mean‚Ä¶ *what if I‚Äôm the book you wish you never read?* We‚Äôre getting to the good part, the climax of the scene, here‚Äôs all the worst parts of me and exactly what they mean‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a lot of things I wanted to say then‚Ä¶ like *am I the door you regret having budged?* Here‚Äôs all the worst parts of me. I‚Äôm ready to be judged. I‚Äôm sorry, I mean‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not, I mean‚Ä¶people have been mean. I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶I mean‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not, I mean‚Ä¶some scars can‚Äôt be scrubbed clean. I mean‚Ä¶people hurt me because *I* gave them the chance. There‚Äôs a lot of things they said then‚Ä¶because of that‚Ä¶I‚Äôm still plucking splinters from my heart. I mean‚Ä¶ if you asked me how they hurt me, I wouldn‚Äôt even know where to start. So, *if you could choose someone to be with, why would I assume you‚Äôd choose me?* And even then‚Ä¶ *what if you‚Äôre choosing someone I can never fully be?*‚Äù

Tears roll down her cheeks, her soft skin is all wet from the tears she shed, because of *my* words. I could make her feel something, however‚Ä¶ the feeling we‚Äôre talking about is sadness. She embraces me, while sobbing, she promises she will never leave me. I trust her, she seems trustworthy. I am giving life *one* last chance. If this fails again, I‚Äôll completely and fully give up. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt regret meeting you. You‚Äôre an amazing person, the problem is that the world hasn‚Äôt been very nice to you. It‚Äôs my job to fix you‚Ä¶ You‚Äôll see, under all this darkness, light will slowly appear again in your life, you can‚Äôt go back to where you came from, it‚Äôs going to be better, I promise you.‚Äù

One year later, we‚Äôre still together, we always see each other after class. I haven‚Äôt done anything ‚Äúbad‚Äù to myself for a very long time, and it‚Äôs all because of her. She saved me. I can‚Äôt describe in words how grateful I am for her. She‚Äôs been there for me every single day, no matter if she was away on holiday, if she was sick or if she was asleep. No matter what, Stephanie always had my back. She was an amazing girlfriend too, we went out on dates, had sleepovers, she bought me chocolates and flowers, we cuddled, we spent quality time together and much more. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better girlfriend.

However, that didn‚Äôt last long. A few months ago, my mother announced me that we have to move to another city, for whatever reason she came up with. I am completely devastated. I won‚Äôt be able to see Stephanie anymore. This city is everything I‚Äôve known for my whole life, and now my whole world is turned upside down. It‚Äôs not like I had many friends here, but at least I had *her*. I had Stephanie and that was enough. I have no idea how to tell her, I know she‚Äôll be heartbroken too, but most likely, not to the same extent as me. She can always find a better girlfriend, a pretty, radiant girl. Not a small, sad, *scarred* girl like me. That is something I can‚Äôt do, I can‚Äôt find someone better. She was my only hope, it was like I was holding onto life when I was around her. She showed me how to live. Now, she‚Äôs getting taken away from me too. I gave life one last chance about one year ago. It ended up disappointing me again, as usual. I don‚Äôt even actually know why I‚Äôm surprised. As I‚Äôve said before, it‚Äôs always been like this. Life messed with me again. Only this time, I am not giving it any other chances, I‚Äôm done. I am sick and tired of everything. The only reason I am alive right now was Stephanie, especially after the teacher I was attached to left. She helped me through severe hardship. Now, I am all alone again. Utterly alone.

Two more weeks have passed, I think that I finally have the courage to tell Stephanie the news, knowing that today is the last day I‚Äôll ever be able to see her. This is truly the end. I really don‚Äôt want to do this. I feel like I‚Äôll break down once I find myself standing in front of her. I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôll be able to speak, I feel like I‚Äôll just lose control and go insane the moment I see her splendid face, her sun-kissed cheeks, her wholesome eyes that were full of light each time you saw them, and yet if you looked more closely, you could see a glimpse of sadness, a sadness that was unexplainable, unless you knew the *full* story of her life. 

I take a breath in, and a breath out, in, out, in, out. Just like she taught me. Whenever I feel scared or nervous, I have to do this rather simple breathing exercise, in hopes that it‚Äôll calm me down, and drift my thoughts away, so that they‚Äôre not taking over my whole body. Despite having tried all the techniques she taught me over time, nothing seemed to work right now. I guess, I‚Äôll just go for it. 

‚ÄúHello Steph. I.. have something to tell you. I‚Ä¶I know how this will sound, but‚Ä¶ I want you to know this, before I leave. You‚Äôve been my muse for a long time, you get me through every dark night, you‚Äôre the only person who was able to find me. I was lucky I stepped on the same land, and dreamed under the same stars as you. You‚Äôre an inspiration to me. You taught me more than anyone ever did in all these years I‚Äôve existed on this planet. However, all nice things have to come to an end. The only problem is that I don‚Äôt want to end this, I want to continue our relationship, I want us to be together even after death rips us apart. I now know that that would never be possible. I have to move, we won‚Äôt be able to see each other, ever again. This *is* the end. All our dreams, everything‚Ä¶ it came crashing down. You‚Äôll have to move on. You deserve better, much better. Not just a *scarred* girl. I‚Äôll always remember you, probably for longer than I‚Äôve actually *known* you, which scares me. I wish I could go back to the day you found me in the bathroom, I wish I could re-live this all over again. Thank you for being here for me, Stephanie. Thank you for taking me out of the misery I was in. The moving away can‚Äôt be helped, you mustn‚Äôt try to help me anymore, I‚Äôm a lost cause, I can‚Äôt be helped. Thank you for trying though.‚Äù I begin crying, silently.

Stephanie‚Äôs eyes were wide, they were filled with something I have never seen before‚Ä¶ was it‚Ä¶despair‚Ä¶?

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶no‚Ä¶no‚Ä¶don‚Äôt‚Ä¶please. There must be a way! I will do everything that stand within my power to help you.‚Äù Stephanie shouts in a breaking voice. We were standing in front of my house, my mother was waiting for me in her car that was completely jammed with boxes and bags filled with our things, she was signaling me. It was time to go.  
 

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs time to say goodbye, but‚Ä¶ in the end, I will seek you out amongst the stars. The space dust of me will whisper *I love you* into the infinity of the universe, hoping one day, it will reach your ears.‚Äù I kissed her softly on her lips and left. It tore the heart out of my body to say goodbye, but it was necessary. Our ‚Äòalmost‚Äô will forever haunt me."

You write very well. I was a bit sceptic at first because I see everything that portrays self harm in a romanticized way as quite problematic. Which is a pity because I would love to support you but I am too worried about potential bad effect. If you feel like writing more I would love your personal version. You do not need to make it more intense, the way you write is already great enough on its own.

"I have no friends in real life or online, its like the hardest thing for me to do. feels impossible to make friends especially online with girls, i dont even want a GF. 

i base my entire personality on number of ""Friends"" i have or the ""Number"" of replies i get. since i have no friends i feel like im not good enough, cool enough or any positive quality 

Its always me messaging first, messaging more, asking more questions, its always me who thinks others are ""Cooler, smarter, better, funnier, more charming"" than me

i really hate my people pleasing personality, always obsessed with making others like me and always asking questions just to stop others from leaving or ghosting. 

i hate that im afraid of being disliked.. but recently i say all kind of things, say the most stupid things to put my self out of my comfort zone. i keep trying new things to put my self out my comfort zone

I want to change and i know change requires action i just dont know what actions to take. 

it's like im afraid of being alone so i do everything i can to not be alone. 

i know i need to be alone for a while and leave social medias behind to focus on my myself but i also dont want to be alone forever 

i know i need to have fun on my own and not depend my happiness on girls online or porn or anything external, or chase external validation

i know i need to get internal validation first but i have no idea how to do that

never anyone chases me or thinks ""im too cool to be friends with them"" 

its always me that thinks ""Others are too cool for me"" and that ""im not good/cool enough to be friends with that cool person""

I probably have messaged like thousands of girls, many times i would try to sext with an opener or say some dumb shit. 

and they mostly reply with one words because what i said didn't make sense or had nothing to do with the conversation

i have no idea how to be interested in people thats why its hard for me to make friends, that's why its like im not that interested in making friends because its always painful for me

i feel like if anyone saw my conversations they would say ""Cringe, disrespectful, Unfunny, Forced, Unlikeable, Uncool, Whiny"" 

i just didn't know what to talk about, or i would ask super personal questions within minutes of talking to them which is disrespectful too..

i just want to have friends, i think i probably would if i cared less about making them. but i dont know what else to care about

Are conversations supposed to be always fun? because i run out of things to say very quickly, even if sometimes i get lucky and say something interesting and funny, then they reply with a long response then i have nothing to say back. or dont know what i should say

Its like i base my self worth on how many lines girls response with, its like if its a one word i will probably get mad at myself and blame myself for not being good enough or cool enough 

im no longer controlled by my lust, i texted this many girls because dating isn't allowed in iraq or at least in some parts, so the only way i talk to a girl is online. 

i can talk to them also in college but i literally have no idea what to talk about wether online or in real life.. i never talked to a girl that isnt a relative in real life

I just never know what to say, or how to make friends.

i now know that Porn/sexting is unhealthy for me and its not very respectful either

or asking for their pictures, bad habit also but i dont know what to talk about. i try to control my urges but its not easy 

but i also don't want my whole life to be about ""Porn/Sexting"" there is so much to life to experience

having no friends makes it even harder to have hobbies, especially in a place like iraq.

but its like im needy and desperate and chase approval or attention in everything i say or do, its actually kinda pathetic. 

i want to be cool, confident, funny, smart, charming or at least one of those things

do i change the way i talk? How do i change my personality so that im not a boring guy anymore. 

i want to change my people pleasing personality, sexting, chasing approval, texting more, not be cringe, or weird, or overly sexual 

i still sometimes try to sext but i try my hardest to not to. bad Habits i guess. 

do i need more interests? do i have to have the same interests as others to be friends? do i need to stop caring about making friends online and focus on my self improvement? 

because it feels like the only goal i need to focus on right now is ""self improvement"" and friends come after , but if i want self improvement i dont want to do it for others"	Butcher__1	post	19.63589247496851	male	White	0.9987505674362183	na	na	na	2	selfhelp
"I'm only basing my advice on the title, sorry your post is too long. My approach is trying to be happy on my own without relying on ""external things"".   

Friends/partners may come and go, you get a job or you lose one etc so when we have friends we feel happy and otherwise we feel sad? So it's like our happiness depends on other things which is not a solid foundation because you it's beyond your control.   

Getting friends, staying as friends is a skill that can be learned. Some are natural at this and some need to learn it.   

There are many videos on youtube that helped me a lot. Search things like how to stop trying to please everyone, how to increase self esteem / self worth etc."	Butcher__1	reply	na	na	na	0.9987505674362183	weak	strong	no	na	selfhelp
"Hi I read your post. There‚Äôs a lot you‚Äôre going through I‚Äôm sorry. I want you to do an activity that I think will help. 

Observe. 

Observe the thoughts that go through your head during the day. Observe the beliefs that lead you to do certain behaviors. Observe how much time you spend doing certain activities. Observe the environment around you and the things your five senses notice. Observe your body‚Äôs reaction to different situations. Observe the people around you and the way they do things. Whether it‚Äôs friends talking or a cool guy walking down the street. 

Why do this? Because by observing you‚Äôre taking your power back from the negative mental chatter that robs you of it. You‚Äôre identifying with the true self that can enact positive change. And you‚Äôre taking the step that‚Äôs necessary for change to happen. Behavior is driven by belief. You can change your beliefs. There‚Äôs a science to everything. You can learn it and even copy it. Write things down if it helps, but start soon start somewhere and start small. The answers are there. You can do it"	Butcher__1	reply	na	na	na	0.9987505674362183	strong	no	no	na	selfhelp
I had a kidney stone earlier this year and I lost my job at a retail company which i was almost glad about. They didnt care about their employees but still losing your job sucks. On top of that I was sick before I woke up with the kidney pain. So I was really on my ass. I quit smoking weed, soda, sugar, everything I enjoyed because I didn't want to feel that pain again. I lost weight, lowest i got was close to 130 i think? Im pretty built so it was very thin for me. Over time I've picked some habits back up but no luck finding a job. I'm terrified of a lot of basic things because they have been giving me panic attacks. Right now I'm crying and as a male it's hard to cry. I feel overwhelmed and scared and lonely even though I have a loving girlfriend. I latch onto her but little by little she is the only thing I care about. Rambling has been an issue too where if I start to talk about my feelings it pours out and I stop myself because I don't want to bother people with my voice. Sorry if this bummed you out but I'm in a very dark place and I need help. I take sertraline for anxiety/depression but I think I'm agoraphobic because I can't handle interactions outside of anything that's comfortable to me. I'll bail on plans or interviews, appointments. I just wanna be OK and like things and work a job I like but the color is leaving my life and I'm sorry for saying the same things a lot but I'm scared	AdditionalParsley212	post	14.764292017656615	female	White	0.9974364638328552	na	na	na	2	selfhelp

"I know I posted something like this recently but this is still an issue of mine. I am really passionate about politics and I am considering going into it. However one of the areas that I am still passionate about which is the death penalty in helping victims of crimes I am still not fully sure about.

When it comes to things like mass shootings, terrorist attacks and serial murders I am passionate about getting victims the justice they deserve. However I really only want to help good victims in these situations not the bad victims. I am not saying that a bad victim deserved to have what happened to them.

What I am saying is that in any of these cases if there are for example 10, 20, or 30 victims. Even though I have to come out and say that there were that many victims the only people that I actually want to help get justice are the good people and not the bad ones.

I wouldn't want to help get justice for bad victims who were horrible, bad, awful people hurting others while they were alive. I was considering possibly just still working to help the victims just knowing in my head I am doing it for the good ones and not the bad people.

What do you think I should do if I am passionate about politics and I want to help victims of crimes get justice but only the good victims not the bad ones?"	NightShout	post	15.205916669816007	female	White	0.011875302530825138	na	na	na	14	selfhelp
"As the other commenter stated the simplest solution would be to stay away from politics, other situations where you may need to provide aid to people.

However that's pretty dumb and if politics is your passion then there reason to change that specifically. I actually think that there is a solution to your problem, which if my understanding is correct that you find it impossible to empathise let alone wish to help people who are evil or bad or whatever. And I think, if I am correct, then there are a couple oft things you can do/realise to maybe come to terms with your problem:  


1. **Realising that you can't possibly know whether somebody is or is not bad.** This is pretty simple and you kind of came close already by stating that you would simply find justice for good people anyway. Because there are very few scenarios ever where you can know if a person is good or bad simply because there aren't really any circumstances where such things become known. For example politicians will generally only serve constituents/citizens from a distance and thus will not meet and gain an in-depth understanding of the psyche and morality of those they legislate for. The same is true for those dealing more directly with people such as police officers, doctors or disaster relief agents as whilst they are directly saving or helping people they are often focused on the issue at hand, say the illness for doctors or crime committed for police, to focus and ascertain whether or not the ""victims"" are good or bad people. Thus as it is unlikely that you will know if those you help are good or bad there isn't much point worrying about it.
2. **Realising that morality is complex as hell.** As the other commenter pointed out a little bluntly things are more complex than just good and bad people. It is almost impossible to truly understand if somebody is a good or bad person without knowledge of all of the actions of their lives, the actions results, the intent of the action or the context and far more. Furthermore people may undertake actions that make no sense to you or I but may be due to differing cultural values or differing upbringings, ie poor or rich, that can lead to entirely different perceptions of the world. Thus as it is highly difficult to know a good person from a bad one there is also little point worrying about it.
3. **Realising that you may need to help bad people anyway.** To put it simply it sucks to do good things for shitty people. No way around it. If we lived in a perfect world we would be able to only do good things for people who deserved them. However this is not the case. So instead we need to think about what happens when we do not help people, providing aid or justice, because we disagree with them or even if they are truly bad people. And the answer is simple: we become bad people. By refusing to bad people in their time of need we stoop to their level and become the people who simply left them. Thus in some scenarios must help bad people, ie providing medical care, becuase to do so otherwise would be an immoral action in and of itself, especially when we cannot confirm if the victim is actually a bad person.
4. **Finally I would just like to recommend that you simply meet and talk to more people.** This is the simplest way to understand that people are not so black and white, and that perhaps they deserve your help anyways. There is no point acting on assumptions on what people will be like, and basing your life choices off of imaginary villains."	NightShout	reply	na	na	na	0.011875302530825138	no	no	no	na	selfhelp

"Great, good that you have this interest and as I already stated I don't see a point in attempting to change this. But it may simply be necessary to focus a whole lot less on the issue of helping ""bad victims"" considering as I said already, you can't know who is bad or not and it's a complex thing that doesn't have a large affect on much of anything as we still need to help bad people because they are still people (although also because if you were a politician it would also be your job even if they were bad people and you wouldn't really have a choice). 

Also worth noting that meeting and understanding a wide breadth of people is still super useful for those interested in politics, aside from this specific issue, as it allows you to understand different viewpoints and why you may agree/disagree with them.

"I agree it probably is a thing of just focusing a whole lot less on the issue of helping bad victims and it is a complex thing that would be my job regardless. 

If your not 100% on what the issue still is that I am talking about then I'll give you an example of what I mean like if there is a mass shooting and 20 people are killed and I feel passionate and strong about getting justice for the victims which I do and that's by making sure the criminal gets the proper punishment which is capital punishment. 

However when I start to deeply think about the victims I consider the fact that some of them might have been good and some might have been bad. Like you said though it's impossible to know who is good and who is bad because you won't actually meet and known these people. 

The real issue in all of this for me is that I do find getting justice for victims something that I find meaningful and I am passionate about. I feel like I will become successful in my life helping victims get the justice they deserve by making sure the criminal receives the proper punishment. 

The only issue in all of this lies in the fact when I actually think about the idea that some of the victims might have not been good people like we talked about and if I met them in real life I would hate this person or that this person was a bully to other people. 

Then I feel like part of my passion, meaning and success went to the wrong people. Like in the example I gave you 20 people were killed and I advocated and fought as hard as i could for 10 good victims which was a success but there were also 10 bad victims that I advocated for as well. 

But like you said it's impossible to know but that's the only issue honestly in all of this."	NightShout	follow-up	na	na	na	0.011875302530825138	weak	no	no	na	selfhelp

"I would say that you are having a negative mindset. It's common, and lots of people do think negatively which can affect your mental health and make you feel ""broken"".

I recommend you think about whether or not you have a negative mindset,  and take sets to improve it.

One of the best ways to improve it is through gratitude. And one effective way (aside from trying to changing your mindset in general) is to do gratitude Journaling. Write down things you are grateful for, and if you are feeling down, you can look at the notes you made to see the positives again. 

I don't know you well enough, but from the bit of information you have given, here are some things I would be grateful for if i wash you:

- having parents that care and love for you, that let you stay under their roof and feed you.
- living in the capital of Kenya, so many possible! And so much more secure then many places out there like Afghanistan (especially for women), Syria and Palestine.
- Your good health, for example you are (probably) not dealing with things like diabetes, major disabilities or cancer!
- Your experiences over the 33 years!
- You actually have a job, a good foundation to get back on your own feet and grow to a happier self.

"Maybe you've considered this but one way to address low motivation is to consider if there any problems you're actively solving or want to solve for yourself or others. This post suggests that you're trying to atleast address the problem of motivation. Problems (not in a negative sense, for example, wanting to cut fat and gain muscle involves solving a number of small problems to get the desired results) we genuinely want to solve sometimes inspire us to act without much willpower to solve them which is a phenomenon some call motivation. 

One tricky thing about problem-solving is that we may deny ourselves of pursuing problems we care about because we think they're ""wrong"" to focus our time and effort on for various reasons. Awareness that one is doing this can also help in resolving motivation challenges.

"Now that you have been honest and noticed where you can improve you can start.

When you notice yourself on the phone while neglecting responsibilities, then put it down. Noticing gives you the decision to do something different.

Practice having your attention on your tasks and doing them with gratitude and meaning. Don't indulge in negative thoughts that says ""I don't want to do this now"" ""I will rush through this task/responsibility so I can get to my phone"". Release all negative thoughts and emotions, by allowing them to come and go. And practice good thoughts/attitudes/feelings/actions.

This is a process and takes practice and repetition. So forgive yourself (and others) when you make mistakes and just keep the intention and willingness to improve. Don't get stuck in guilt/regeret - rather use it to make your intention to improve stronger. Because constant guilt is a form of negativity and drags us down. 

How we feel, or in other words our attitude, influences how we see and react to life. Good attitudes gives us more power to learn and grow.

Keep your goal/decision/intention alive. Your goal might be to use your phone less or to be responsible. Practice not contradicting your goal mentally, emotionally or by action. Although we usually do, because it's a process, and that's normal and fine, we just keep trying. No use in having a goal but thinking negatively about it the whole time.

"When I work as a coach, one of the most common challenges my clients face is not having enough time to do what they truly want. Time is a precious commodity in our lives, even more valuable than money. Once it slips away, there's no way to turn it back. How we choose to spend our time also defines who we are and what we value. It forms the very foundation of our self-worth. If you really want to understand someone, don't just listen to what they say about themselves; observe how they invest their time.

That's precisely how I approach time management in my own life. Before diving into strategies, I pause and reflect on the kind of person I aspire to be. For me, that person has always been a writer. Since I was a child, I've held this dream close to my heart. However, for the longest time, I lacked the confidence to introduce myself to others as a writer. Then, one day, it hit me: my confidence was lacking because I didn't have any evidence or proof to back up my claim. You see, being a writer isn't just about publishing a book or an article; it's about the daily act of writing and committing to it wholeheartedly. So, I made a commitment to write every single day. Regardless of the quality of my writing, I knew that the simple act of dedicating time to it would make me a writer.¬†

**So, the first step towards time management is to ask yourself who you truly want to be and identify the daily actions that can support that identity.**

**The next step involves letting go of distractions and negativity that hinder you from making the most of your time.** Many people create priority lists and highlight what's important when it comes to time management. And while that can be helpful, I've found that it's equally important to determine what is NOT important to you. What are the things you can eliminate or release? Answering the question of what's not important is often harder than determining what is. We tend to cling to everything, fearing that we might miss out or succumbing to our perfectionist tendencies. However, I firmly believe that diluted focus leads to diluted results. **To maintain sharp focus, we must be willing to let go of unnecessary things in our lives.** The pivotal questions here are: What are you willing to sacrifice? What would happen if you let go of that thing? How would it impact you? What would your life look like if you redirected the time you spend on A towards B instead? Give it a try for a week or a month, and if it doesn't work, you can always switch back. Be open to new experiments because you never know what transformative changes they may bring.

To truly make the most of your time, let me share with you an exercise that has made a profound impact on my own journey: journaling your heartfelt responses to the following questions.

Take a moment to ask yourself:

* What kind of person do you truly want to be?¬†
* How do you want others to describe you when they introduce you to someone new?¬†
* And most importantly, what small daily actions can you take to support that desired identity?

At the same time, ask yourself:¬†

* What kind of person do you NOT want to become?¬†
* What aspects of yourself do you dislike?¬†

"So it all comes down to the fact I want to be in a relationship. I want to be loved and I don't feel like that has ever happened. 

It's a hard thing to describe but I just don't feel like I have anything to offer. I have been in two long-term relationships. One when I was young who always put her friends and a good time first, and another when I was grown, she left me for another woman. 

This is compounded by a childhood where all of the people who were supposed to love me were abusive. 

I guess it's left me craving love while simultaneously feeling like I don't deserve it. My rational mind knows that it's unresolved trauma that makes me feel this way. But we don't love with our rational minds. The part of us we love with is broken for me and I don't know how to fix it. It just tells me she's out of my league and I'm kidding myself. I'm not worth being with."	Onikage-shin	post	20.61572625584065	female	White	0.9927065968513489	na	na	na	2	selfhelp

"Since you likely know your life situation best to describe what you mean when you say you don't deserve love. Maybe you've clarified this but if you haven't it could show you why you think you dont deserve the love and give you specifics to address whenever you want to do inner work.

Also, being in a relationship has its benefits but it's also possible to feel ok with yourself even while being single. I wrote a [small piece](https://harrisonobiorah.com/2023/05/17/do-you-need-to-be-in-relationship-to-emotionally-heal-or-be-ok-with-yourself/) about healing emotionally in the absence of a relationship.

">how do you tell between legitimate self help books and books written by salesmen?

I think pretty much *every* book has at least *something* to contribute; some are simply better than others.  Either way, reading expands your overall knowledge set, so just keep at it, even if the book is dumb, because then you learn both what works and what DOESN'T work!  The bottom line is this:

* **Were you able to take anything out of it that helped improve your life?**

For example, when I was studying personal finances, one of the books I read was ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" by Robert Kiyosaki.  It's received a lot of criticism over the years, but it also taught me the ""income, assets, expenses, liabilities"" model, which has *very* clear workflows for how people in different financial classes (lower, middle, and upper class) manage their finances, which provided me with a foundation to build my own personal financial system on!

Here are some good books I like on productivity that are quality resources:

* **Getting Things Done** by David Allen
* **Attitude is Everything** by Jeff Keller
* **Grit** by Angela Duckworth
* **Mindset** by Carol Dweck
* **The Talent Code** by Daniel Coyle (also see the Little Book of Talent & The Culture Code)
* **Atomic Habits** by James Clear
* **Tiny Habits** by BJ Fogg
* **Man's Search for Meaning** by Viktor Frankl

And on persuasion:

* **One Sentence Persuasion** by Blair Warren
* **The Tools of Argument** by Joel P. Trachtman
* **Pre-suasion** by Robert Cialdini
* **All Marketers are Liars** by Seth Godin
* **The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs** by Carmine Gallo
* **Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products** by Nir Eyal
* **How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big** by Scott Adams
* **Loserthink** by Scott Adams
* **Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don't Matter** by Scott Adams

I was able to take information & tools away from each of those books & apply them in my life in a positive way, so if you're interested in either productivity and/or persuasion, this list will keep you busy for the next few years!"		reply	na	na	na	0.9987807869911194	no	no	strong	na	selfhelp
"I think it has more to do with the reader than the book

A lot of procrastinators will pretend to themselves that they are making progress towards their goals through the act of reading a self help book. They get the same dopamine hit as if they actually made progress in their goals and then actually stop making an actual attempt at their goals because they were satiated by that dopamine hit. Reading the book is just a form of high tech distraction and procrastination, some books are designed to give the biggest dopamine hit and  create the most illusion of progress, thats the snake oil they sell.

&#x200B;

Same thing with telling other people about your goals. If you say you have big goals to others you get the same dopamine hit as if you actually completed that goal and youre less likely to move forward because you already got the dopamine you wanted because others now see you as successful or moving towards success in an abstract way.

Abstain from telling others about your goals until they become accomplishments, and stop procrastinating your goals by reading self help books (if these are traps you fall into)"		reply	na	na	na	0.9987807869911194	no	strong	no	na	selfhelp
"> Now, what do you do to differentiate between the two?

It's not easy and often not even *possible.* I've heard professors from decent universities spouting scientifically embarrassing nonsense (for a real hoot, search on YouTube for Michael Persinger and no more secrets!) and yet most people don't have the background to evaluate it properly. Sometimes academics just flat out fake their studies and then they write books based on their fake research and then *other* people cite the fake research and put it in *their* books: Brian Wansink (who studied eating), Marc Hauser (who studied/wrote about morals), Dan Ariely (who writes about honesty; he claims it was a mistake), Francesca Gino (who studies honesty), German anesthesiologist Joachim Boldt (*184* retracted papers!) and many others.

For example, this book *Your Brain on Porn*, I would have to read it to do my best to evaluate if it actually *was* legit. Even if the author is a scientist and/or professor. It may be; it may not be. (if I have some background in brain stuff, at least.)

If you don't have a background in a particular field, it is very tough to make these evaluations, but there are some basic guidelines you can use. These are red flags:

- Does it seem too good to be true? 
- Does the author seem to oversimplify a complex, messy thing? 
- Does the author seem to be the first one in history to have figured out some major new thing, basically by just thinking it up?
- Does the ""answers"" given feel good, reassuring, macho, cool, or mystical--but if you look at them dispassionately, doubt starts to seep in?
- If it's a book from prior to about 1970, does it seem hokey, corny, based in weird old Americana stuff, or the New Thought movement, some weird backstory to it (just like Napoleon Hill)
- It is New Agey?
- Do the answers seem easy--like just think real hard about what you want and you'll get it--and then does it seem that if it were really that easy, everyone would already be doing it?
- Does the author have a whole ""cottage industry"" going around the ideas (more books, videos, subscriptions, pricey seminars, swag, etc.)
- Does the author have a high-pitched-for-a-man voice and a very strong Canadian accent?
- Does it seem ""so crazy it just might work""?

"I'm a 21 yo student immigrant , I've been diagnosed with autism. When I was leaving my home country I had a lot of irl friends who would help me and support me.
Now, almost 4 years after immigrating I have quite literally not a single person I talk to irl. The only person I talk to is my mother, we talk on the phone . If I ever have a problem, she can never just support me like my friends used to. She does try her best to solve it but the problem usually is that she can't support me the same way others could. She always says ""I'm so tired of trying, Ive been doing this and that to support you I don't know what else to do anymore""
Because of moving, I became an antisocial person, abandoning almost everysingle friend I had and I developed an addiction for social media and procrastinating
In short, right now I'm getting back on track, I REALLY emotional support that I used to have for me to truly flourish, because I don't think anything else is a problem. 
I really don't know what to do me and my mother got into a fight because of it and now I'm just completely alone. I don't know how to find people to talk to
I moved to a much smaller country that has a different mentality and I'm just seen as weird here because of my autistic behaviour and I'm just made fun of for it, so as far as I can see irl friends are not an option

I've never met you so I can't assure you that you aren't deemed as weird for sure, a different mentality isn't always bad and it's a thing that can be adjusted and accustomed to with time, there's always gonna be judgy people regardless of who you are but im sure there's people you can meet who will accept you just as you are so I hope you don't completely rule out irl friends

"I cant consume self improvement material in moderation.

The problem is I get sucked into consuming self-improvement material and thats the only thing I am doing in my free time. I am not taking any actual action. Worse yet I also start spending money on shopping because sometimes these channels reccomend products.

Sometimes I do discover something useful. For example, I recently found a Men's lifestyle youtube channel and the guy was talking about the importance of sunscreen even in cold weather. I never knew that you need sunscreen even if its not sunny. The sunscreen helps protect your skin.

Similarly sometimes I read something about dating ina book and I feel like the explanation helped me a lot. Which results in me adding six more books to my reading queue. I cant just stop with one book. I CANT. Its like an itch I have to scratch.

The problem is that it escalates to a crazy level to the point where I am either just consuming self improvement material or (buying things referred by the self improvement material).

I spent the entire weekend browsing Men's lifestyle, fashion, skincare channels one after the other. Leading to lots of shopping. I did not take action for my actual goals i.e. Going to the gym, Using the dating app, going out more often.

Being mindful of my behavior and reminding myself to give others a chance to speak has been the key.

"I (M25) have this problem since I was a child, I have a fetish with sleeveless outfits. It affected the way I dress, I never wore a tank top in my life unless I had to at school, but even in gym I wore a coat to hide my upperarms. I'm already over 20 years old and with each passing year I keep asking myself when am I going to lose this fear, what do I need to do to see the world like everyone else.

I had every opportunity to work on that fear and I threw it away. I studied for 5 years at a school where the physical education uniform was a tank top. I've tried a few times in the heat of the moment to expose my arms, but I've always felt an oppressive shame, a huge desire to cover them up, wear something over them, so as not to be seen.

And I don't really know what fear I have. I'm thin, but for me appearance is not a problem, I have dyed hair, painted nails, tattoos, sometimes people may think I'm gay, but none of that affects me. Now, if I'm seen wearing a tank top, maybe I'm afraid people will see me the way I see others in a tank top, sexualized.

Here the only clothing rule is to wear pants and sneakers, so it doesn't really matter what you wear. I am at all costs trying to loosen up, enjoying the isolation from the rest of the company. Every now and then I roll up the sleeves to expose the upperarms, but it doesn't last long, I'm already scared someone will come out and see me.

I've already talked to a psychologist about this, with my girlfriend, but it seems that nobody really understands me. I feel like I'm the only one in the world with this fetish, which really bothers me. And the urge to wear a tank top is something I've always felt. I'm fine wearing one at home, alone. But when there's another person in the same room, I instinctively avoid it, even hide my tank tops.

TDLR: I have a fetish that prevents me from wearing tank tops in public, and I've struggled my whole life to get over the fear."	First-Championship13	post	27.299506316665994	female	White	0.9885567426681519	na	na	na	4	selfhelp

"For similar but different reasons I was afraid to wear tank tops too..  Mostly from being afraid of attention cause I've always had good arms. Around my mid 20s and a couple years of gym, I worked on my confidence to wear some. Now it's just normal and wonderful.

Be patient with yourself, I think the fetish is fine so long as you don't act on it inappropriately with others. I've got a muscle fetish - I drool for muscly guys and for years was afraid of staring, of being caught, afraid of being anywhere near them so gyms were a no go. Nowadays I try not to state but I'll get a sneaky look in, and half the time people enjoy the attention anyways. I still have a bit of shame about the fetish cause it doesn't feel normal, but it is what it is.

I think it'd be a benefit to work on it, one day you'll wear a tank outside of your home and it'll feel liberating :) be kind to yourself."	First-Championship13	reply	na	na	na	0.9885567426681519	no	strong	no	na	selfhelp

"Hi, I'm 16 (m). I've basically just come out of a long period of something I can't really describe. I don't really know if it was depression or just loneliness but either way it all started when I was like 14 and the childhood friend group who I was always out with finally made it perfectly clear that I wasn't welcome there anymore. We all lived in the same estate and had been mates for ages but I realised some time before this final event that they were ostracising me and I didn't know why. To this day I don't really know but my best guess is that it was because I was just more nerdy and kind of less into ""popular"" stuff which meant it was easy for me to be the target of the group. Not only that but there was one guy who always had it out for me and when I confronted him he just said he didn't like my voice or the way I talked which I think can tell you what kind guys they were but either way I can safely say I'm glad I'm not friends with them anymore. Sadly my younger self felt a bit differently.

I never hung out with them again after that day. What happened wasn't much so I won't bother explaining but they made it clear that they weren't my friends so I just closed myself off from them. After that I kind of just spent all my time alone. Sure I spent time with my family but at my mam's house I just stayed in my room because my little brother wouldn't always drive me crazy if I went downstairs so I mostly spent time with my dad. At school I didn't really have any friends, just like some acquaintances or something like that and as I said before I was and still am nerdy. I'm a bit introverted and after everything that happened with those guys I spent a good while just hanging out with some group of acquaintances in the yard since I sucked at putting myself out there. This was during covid so no going into town at lunch.

Afted covid everyone in my year began going into town at lunch. This meant that not only at home but also at school, I was basically always alone. For some reason my entire memory of this time is just fuzzy. I can't remember why or if ever actually considered the idea but I basically shut my brain off from ever introspecting. I spent all day playing games and never tried to actually fix my problem. I blamed my old friends and just wanted to have what I had lost, a group of people to just hang out with all the time. One day at class I hit it off with a really extroverted guy and we ended up going lunch together since his best mate wasn't in that day. From then on I had a friend. We hung out every lunch time and through him I made more friends and a whole group of us were hanging out every day. It just so happened that none of them lived close by and were all like 20 minute drives from my town. I ended up never trying to meet up with them outside school because I was worried they would say no since I doubted we were actually that good friends and that they wouldn't want to have actually organise a meet up with lifts and everything.

My parents encouraged me sometimes to do so of course but I always ignored them like a fucking dumbass and just kept playing games. As I said my memory of this time is just blank. I can remember certain events but no general idea of what state I was in. I don't even remember when it started but I'd have breakdowns where I'd just start crying. Not often but they happened probably half a dozen times. I don't even remember the specifics I think I just wanted to disappear. I was done. The fact that I can't even cohesively recollect who I was at this time is kind of the root of my problem. I thankfully have come out of that place. Some stuff happened that I can't even begin to bother trying to actually get in chronological order because I don't even know why I began to change but I did. I decided enough was enough and that I had to stop trying to get back a friend group that didn't exist because my friends were all not close by anymore. This didn't mean I had to be lonely. I began trying to get out more and have been. The issue is that I think I'm now borderline having an identity crisisüéâüéâüéâüéâ! 

I lived for so long just avoiding even thinking about my life. I just sought after friendship and acceptance and nothing else. I was an arrogant, immature dumbass when I started out whatever the hell you even call this journey but during that time afterwards I can't even describe who I was. I think about it and I feel like there were days I wanted to kill myself, days I was just tired and indifferent af. Days when I was fine. Days when I stayed up until 4 watching a new show. Days when I was moody with friends. Days when I was lively with them. I honestly don't know what the fuck personality I had. Which brings me to the issue of just, not knowing who I am. When I think of my friends I can describe my image of them pretty well. I can remember how they act and would know if they were off if I hung out with them. I don't know how I act. I can't begin to explain this feeling because it doesn't make sense to me but I just don't know how you would even go about understanding this. Like most people usually have a core self that they are most easily identified by right? I don't know mine. I think I acted happy with friends but when I think back I also remember being quiet, trying to fit in and being afraid of being judged. I don't know how to be myself. Now that I've stopped wallowing in despair I want to start working on myself and begin to spend my time better but I can't start until I sort this out because when something important gets in my head it doesn't fuck off and let me just be ok until I figure it out. I want to become a better person but how do I begin to do that when I don't know myself? Does my past matter? Am I just a different person now? But the habits and traits that I had during that time are the basis of myself aren't they? I want to be the best me I can but just picking some traits like helpful and sarcastic or some bs like that is just wrong to me so I don't know what to do. I honestly don't want to bother going back through this because I know even I'll be confused but please someone help me out because I can't describe this problem in a way google can understand so reddit is my last hope."	reddit0-0user	post	18.392200611432543	female	White	0.9972051978111267	na	na	na	1	selfhelp

I would leave that job before it destroys you mentally and physically. I know you're stressed and having diarrhea at before work and that a sign that your body is stressed. Iv been in your situation before were my workplace was so toxic it caused me shut down and I then went to a courtyard and sat down and contemplated if I should stay or quit. I ended up quitting and the stress was lifted off my shoulder. Thankfully I found a job that pays me more and my boss takes care of us in which I'm thankful for.  Do you like what you're are doing at work? It also feels like there nor much of a work life balance at this work place.

That's what I was going to suggest. From my experience I always regretted rush decisions on quitting a job.

All the mental health people I have interacted with, (few therapists and one psychiatrist) have all been wrong about thoughts, assumptions, medications, etc. have all been less than helpful. bascially my entire existence in dealing with the mental health industry has honestly made things worse imo.

So Question for anyone who has experience in this area. My daughter whom is 24 years old, has dated a little here and there nothing serious but we were discussing with each other about the Subject of Mental Health. She has major depression and a mild version of Bipolar. The question is, at what point of Dating someone should she bring up her Mental Health without scaring someone away? She takes medication btw as well as therapy which is very helpful. We just were curious how soon or later should she bring this subject up with an individual she's serious about pursuing? Thanks and please keep the comments kind.	True2self45	post	70.73734315849183	male	White	0.004510778933763504	na	na	na	1	selfhelp
"There is not particularly ""right time"".  It depends on the person, and on your daughter and how their date is going and what they are discussing, and so on.  She can follow her intuition.

"I have an objectively really good life (good job, good relationships, healthy) and really nothing major to complain about but I have a tendency to fixate on negative things mostly at like a macro level and in my professional life and I worry that it alienates people and also makes my quality of life worse in general.

I recently have become fixated for example of how bad the infrastructure is in Toronto and how it's so poorly designed for anything except driving a car and we have horrible traffic.

Another example, I recently had a need to go to the doctor and have been frustrated by our health care system but again started dwelling on how it was such a big issue at a systemic level (reading articles and such).

I work in tech sales and make good money but again I've recently become so jaded about corporate life and hustle culture. Even though I suck it up and do my job I just dont feel any passion for it and am constantly trying to ward off negative thoughts about work and not come across as a pessimist.

Any ideas on how to cope/get out of these negative thought patterns? Any good books you'd recommend?"	PlentySatisfaction1	post	34.77123130929489	male	White	0.9769516587257385	na	na	na	4	selfhelp

I arrived on holidays 4 days ago with my girlfriend, our daughter (1 year old) and her Mother. The first 2 nights here, my girlfriend stayed out until 7 am by herself while I stayed in the room all night with our daughter. On the 3rd night, I went out and arrived back at 4 am to see her pissed drunk. I do not know what she was doing but to the best of my knowledge she was with another man but she denies it. A group of her and her Mothers friends joined the holiday and she is now hanging out with them and moved to her Mothers room and left me alone. I have never felt so betrayed and so dark. I never seen her as someone who could behave like this and show no remorse. I have always had a problem with using drugs and alcohol to cope with these situations and ended up blowing all my money on such. I will now be staying in this hotel room by myself for the next 3 days until the journey home. Which will be awkward and terrible. I feel so alone and such an evil, dark presence. When I arrive home, I am not sure what I will do as we rent her Mothers place and I have no close family or friends near to stay with. I will most likely have to stay with her until I can save money to move which will take a few weeks as I am a laborer and earn 10 an hour. This is the lowest, darkest and most uncertain feeling I have ever had. I understand it could be much worse but this is how I feel personally. But I look at this as an opportunity. I will get through this. I have a plan. This time next year I will be in the best position of my life. I promise you. I will be uploading daily my journey, how I feel and my plans. Please join me on this journey.	bladman22	post	34.7101397662055	male	White	0.9972355961799622	na	na	na	2	selfhelp
Today was the most unproductive day I think I've ever had in my adult life. I've been in this dingy hotel room by myself all day. Tomorrow we fly home and I am not looking forward to being around these people at all. I can't wait to get back, get my shit together and re centre. I have a plan in place and I am extremely focused. I feel that I have so much energy waiting to be used up. I will keep updating daily. As I have literally done nothing today, I have little to say.

I made a post like this last week and am happy with the results. I met some lovely people and made genuine connections with them. If you need someone to talk to/vent to, please feel free to reach out via DM or Discord; my contact information is available on my profile.

My name is Ace (23M), and I‚Äôve struggled with mental health issues for most of my life. Fortunately, I‚Äôm in a much better place now. I never really opened up to anyone, including my family or friends, about my struggles because I didn‚Äôt want to feel like a burden or judged. Now that I‚Äôm doing better, I would like to provide support to others who may be going through similar experiences. I know how difficult it can be to face all these challenges alone.

"**Invest in yourself, and your self-image will flourish:**

**Identify and challenge your limiting beliefs.** While they have many guises, most limiting beliefs can be distilled down to two essential beliefs: I‚Äôm not good enough & I‚Äôm not worthy. We may also carry over beliefs from our early years which served us well then but now hinder us as adults. 

**Recognize ‚Äì and celebrate - your small victories.** Whatever small victories are meaningful to you. Within the context of having strategic plans, each small step is a victory in itself and also a step towards something so much bigger. 

**Take responsibility for your current situation.** When you take responsibility, you take control. And when are in control, you have options and choices.

**Do something for others.** Creating meaning for yourself and value for others helps build your win / win relationship with the world around you.

**Take a step each day toward your ideal self.** We all have the same 168 hours each week ‚Äì that‚Äôs just physics ‚Äì the issue is what we choose to do with them. Adopting the habit of frequently asking yourself: what would be the most valuable thing I can do right now that would be a step in the right direction? 

**Manage your self-talk.** We all talk to ourselves ‚Äì it‚Äôs just how our brains work. When we choose to take control of our internal dialogue, we can make it work for us.

**Focus on the value adding activities.** When we think about what we have on our plate, considering how important and how urgent each item is really puts things in perspective. When we focus our efforts on what is important ‚Äì in the context of what we have chosen to achieve ‚Äì we‚Äôre moving in the right direction.

**Avoid comparing yourself to others.** This points to the difference between self-esteem (externally focused) and self-worth (internally focused). The only valid comparison is our previous self.

**A healthy self-image is central to our wellbeing. By adopting these habits, we can help ourselves to keep moving in the right direction.**"	EERMA	post	37.7786320633341	female	White	0.0012512494577094913	na	na	na	2	selfhelp

"Hi everyone! So my (F20) boyfriend (M20) have been together for almost 5 years now. I love him to death, we're the best of friends and we've grown so much together. We got together at 15 when we were still in school and are each others ""firsts"" at everything. We've always dream and plan for the future ahead together, and we rarely fight. Also, we got each others backs in everything so it seems like we have a perfect relationship. I really couldn't imagine my life without him, and I really don't want to either. I can see myself being old with him, with children and grandchildren and just living happily ever after. So, what's the problem?

Lately he's been having doubts. He says he loves me and that I'm ""the girl of his life"" and doesn't want to be with anybody else. He's been trying therapy for two months now because he says it is his only priority right now to be okay with me, that he wants nothing more than to solve his doubts and be with me.

This has been breaking my heart for two and a half months now because he hasn't said ""I love you"" to me in all this time. He says he wants to be sure before saying anything, and I guess that's good because he doesn't want to make me feel bad by saying something he then regrets. Anyway, a few days ago he told me he feels he made a lot of progress, that he'll be okay again anytime soon. I believe him, mainly because he's been so good to me in all this time, and he shows me determination to fix everything and he's always making plans with me and wants to see me all the time.

I guess this problem got me thinking about breaking up because he's the only thing I know. I want my life to be with him, but also, I'm 20 years old and he's everything I know. Should I have other experiences other than being in the most sane and good relationship ever? The thing is I don't want that with anybody else, but sometimes I fantasize about, you know, just grabbing a drink with a guy and just doing a casual thing. Breaking up doesn't mean I don't love him (because I do so much), but just that I feel like, in my 20's, maybe I should be having these experiences before I'm too old to be doing any of those things.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to be 40, married to him, regretting I never knew anything else other than him. He's great, he's the love of my life and I really don't want to be without him, but seeing my friends doing all these things sometimes makes me wonder if I'm not living my youth completely...

I was in a similar position to you once upon a time. I dated someone from the time I was 17 and dated for years, basically growing up with him. I had the same fears because he was my first boyfriend.

I think it's just super cool you have such a relationship, most people don't have that much time and energy for each other.  I don't think it's good to think about breaking up or to see how things would develop with other people, the fact that someone does it doesn't mean you should too. If people cheat on their boyfriend so easily, etc., it doesn't speak well for them.  everything is superficial.  However, both of you should separate a bit, yes it's great that you are together, but sometimes personal space is better than going out together in one company or separately.  Together strive and contribute to your goals even if you do something separately. But also don't end it all the time saying the same thing every day I love you and so on do something you haven't done just have fun and don't think to try with  another person will have a good effect on both you and him.I don't know if I helped with anything, but still	No_Garbage_5538	reply	na	na	na	0.0055936421267688274	weak	no	no	na	selfhelp

"I'm going through a similar experience right now too (you can read my previous post to r/selfhelp from yesterday if you want to know more). 

Honestly, most of my comforting systems until now have been more or less destructive (i.e., drugs, video games, etc.). I wouldn't recommend depending on these for comfort as they'll further drive you into a hole. 

Instead, I like to listen to music, hit up friends just to chat or meditate. I find meditation to be especially helpful. It helps me escape typical day-to-day concerns, like money, career, social life, regrets, etc. and instead focus on more basic things we often take for granted. 

Like right now, I'm alive, I have my health, and I have my senses. It seems silly at first, but the simple fact that we're breathing right now feels like a miracle. It feels amazing and I treasure it. 

I have eyes and I can see. I can appreciate art, nature and human achievements. 

I have ears and I can hear. I can appreciate music, hear laughter, and the sounds of nature. 

I have legs and arms. I can walk wherever I choose. I can dance. I can pick things up and type out this very message. 

I have my cognitive ability. I can ponder ideas and imagine things. I can be creative, and I can be analytical. 

It's about focusing on the base principles that make us human.

It's so simple. Money is a fleeting concept. Failure is also a fleeting concept, and the feeling will dissipate with time. Even the feeling of breakups or ending relationships will also wash away with time. Our sensory experiences will (in most cases) last our entire lives. Obviously, there's outliers (i.e., disability, health issues, etc.), but that's why it's important to value and treasure those right now. 

Also, let yourself feel emotions. If you need to cry, cry. If you want to laugh, laugh. Even if you're alone. You'll feel better and more alive because of it."	Jpoolman25	reply	na	na	na	0.9988061189651489	no	strong	no	na	selfhelp

I think it's about time I try to get help. What's happening with me has been 5+ years in the making. I believe that in order to receive the most accurate advice, it's important to give the full story. This could be a long post, so bear with me.

I'll give my backstory, but since its long, you can skip it and go down to where I'm at now.

========================================================

**START OF BACKSTORY**

**2014:** Graduated high school. I was full of confidence due to being ""popular"", having good grades (3.4GPA, 27 on ACT) despite not trying very hard. While it was fairly easy for me to make friends and socialize, I was not the healthiest - mentally. I had some pretty serious anger and anxiety issues, looking back. I frequently got in fights with my dad, often due to placing restrictions on video games or hanging out with friends. This wasn't much of an issue for my first 3 years of high school, as my dad was able to restrain me fairly easily due to my small stature. However, my senior year I began to work out and become more physically active, leading me to become less-easily restrained. So, in my final semester, I got in another fight with him, and this time I was able to overpower him. Of course, this terrified my mom and little sister, so my mom called 911. The moment I heard this, I came to my senses and ran out of the house.

I was anxious and resentful, feeling a lot of hate toward myself. I must have been gone for an hour, when my mom sent me a text pleading me to go home. She said the cops were gone so I didn't have to worry. I started walking back, and well, the cops were still there. He arrested me. When he put me in the back of the car, something snapped inside me - like I was possessed by a demon. I became belligerent and began having a full-fledge panic attack, flailing my body, scratching and hitting myself, kicking the car, etc. My vision and memory are kind of a blur after this, but I ended up in the hospital before getting checked in to a juvey cell for maybe an hour or 2 before my parents picked me up.

After this, I doubled down on investing more time with my friends, as most of my peers were just as mental as I was. We partied 2-3 times a week doing drugs, getting into fights, etc. I've already been smoking weed since junior year, but I'm now doing more drugs (ecstasy, molly, shrooms & cocaine). Coincidentally, I'd also just gotten a prescription for Adderall and an SSRI after being diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression in addition to also seeing a therapist. My mood was all over the place, and I would frequently pull all-nighters (1-3 times a week) during my last 2 months of high school as I tried to keep up with homework. Looking back, I'm actually impressed I graduated, seeing as I was falling behind in multiple AP classes.

**2014-2015:** My first few college semesters were pretty normal. My best friend and I moved out of state together, and I began taking school more seriously. If I had homework, I'd turn down invitations to go out in order to focus on school. I'd also gotten a job at Starbucks, and I started meeting new friends. Life was really good.

**2016:** I consider this year the year that everything changed for me. It started one fateful morning in January during a 4 AM morning shift at Starbucks. I remember clocking in and starting my shift...then BOOM. I'm waking up on floor of the bathroom. My body is wet, and I'm completely confused as to how I got there. The first thing I think is ""oh shit, was I so tired that I came in here to take a nap?"". I calm myself before leaving, assuming my coworkers wouldn't realize. Imagine my shock when I come out to see 4-5 EMT paramedics & my boss looking at me with concern.

**Turns out I just had my first seizure.**

1 week later, I had my 2nd seizure - this time, while I was driving. Luckily, I was driving alone & no one else was hurt. My car was totaled, as I had crashed into a concrete wall.

I don't think I was the same after this. I started missing shifts at work, so I got fired. I would ghost my friends, and I would typically spend my days playing video games. I also dropped out of college. I had been taken off my Adderall prescription and was now on Lamictal. Around this time, I grew a lot of disdain for the pharmaceutical industry due to how apathetic I was treated by the multiple neurologists I saw (most of them would leave the choice on which medication to go with, as if they aren't the fucking professional who went to school for 10+ years).

I would continue to have seizures, even with the medication, leading to the dose to increase. My emotions became numb, and I felt like a walking NPC with a lot of hate in my heart. I hated myself, and I hated society.

**2017:** Somehow, I survived. I got a pretty decent job at an investment bank and started making friends again. I was feeling pretty good with my ""adult job"", wearing my ""adult suit"". This was also short lived - and I started to absolutely hate it. ""Is this what the rest of my life is?"", I thought, as I'd sit in my cubicle for 10 hours a day doing the same task over and over again. I regularly had to go to my car or bathroom to have panic attacks, as I considered all my dreams dying (becoming an artist, or even a fashion designer). I went on short-term disability, which ended up being 6-months long. Afterwards, I'd come back to work, which felt like a fever dream. I quit after 4 months.

**2018-2019:** Ok, I'm trying to get my shit together. I'm working out again, I started dating a really sweet girl and got another office job - this time at a startup, *which made me feel really cool.* The fact it was an open office made it feel less dystopian + they had a kitchen with all-you-can-eat snacks and unlimited cold brew on tap.

Beginning of 2019, I'd started watching Joe Rogan's podcast. I saw he talked a lot about this mysterious drug I'd never heard about - DMT. I became fascinated and obsessed, often thinking ""maybe this is what I need to fix myself"". Coincidentally, my dealer had also alerted me that he is selling DMT - I hadn't ask him if he had any nor did I mention my fascination about it. It seemed like divine fate. So, I bought the cartridge and began researching how to safely take it, where to take it and potential health concerns. **I felt ready.**

I was not ready.

Maybe it was because of my Christian upbringing, but as soon as I took 3 hits of the DMT and closed my eyes, I instantly started to hallucinate what I can only describe as a kaleidoscope of demonic faces all blending into each other, zooming in like a fractal. It felt like they were communicating to me with their facial expressions, with their message being ""You gullible child, you shouldn't be here. Now you're ours."". I tried opening my eyes to look at phone, but I couldn't move my arms and the room around me was melting.

The experience lasted all of 20 minutes but felt like hours. I was able to remind myself that anything that I experienced wasn't real and was a result of taking a powerful substance. I would end up taking it 2 more times (with less evil results), before passing it off to one of my friends who was also interested in it.

I felt euphoric and ready to take on the world. So, in May, I quit my job to enroll in a 6-month web development bootcamp, and I took it seriously. I excelled in class, due to the fact that I was dedicating 12+ hours a day to coding and the support from my girlfriend.

In October 2019, I had received an offer to my first dev job, which started the weekend after my last week of class. It was overwhelming at first, since I was working with code I've never seen before and the only other developers who I could consult were outsourced from India. Their responses were delayed due to time difference, and often rude.

I was also smoking my weed pen every day, from morning to evening, even at work. I'd convinced myself that it helped me work, and part of me still believes it did. I'm not sure if my coworkers didn't notice or if they didn't care.

**2020:** Everything changed. My girlfriend dumped me, probably because I was out of it whenever I was home and wasn't giving her the attention, she needed. I'm ashamed to admit this, but looking back, I had often used my mental health as an excuse for not doing things with her, when in reality I just wanted to be lazy. I think this was emotionally abusive. I don't blame her for leaving. If I was her, I would have left earlier.

I had moved back in with my parents, who were also living in the same state now. COVID started too. I'd also been laid off, which sucked, but I was also getting paid more in unemployment & now I had time to work on passion projects.

**2021:** After 6 months of collecting unemployment checks and a temporary shit job at a remote call center, I finally got another dev job at an agency. It was an ok job. I mainly worked with Wordpress, which I hated at first but warmed up to it. Boss was really ambitious but was also not willing to take enough risk nor hire enough people to support his ambition. While I was feeling ambitious too, it became clear that progress wasn't being made. Luckily, a contractor I worked with at the time had invited me out for drinks to invite me to interview at his family's software company. I got hired and was making substantially more than my previous job. This motivated me to move out of my parents' home and get my own place downtown.

**2022:** I started my new job where I was working with code that I was more passionate about. I'd also just moved into my new place, which was super sleek and modern. I felt really good. The interesting thing about this apartment is that they used a ""coliving"" model - which meant that they would pair you with roommates, enabling a smaller rent payment for people who wanted to live on their own and didn't want to coordinate roommates beforehand. It seemed like a cool way to make new friends!

While I did make friends, one of my roommates was a nightmare to live with. She would constantly give me and everyone else shit for not doing this and not doing that, while simultaneously doing the same things she was accusing us of. With my history of mental health and drug use, I sympathized with her, and we got along, kinda. Although we'd still have falling outs from time to time.

I tried my hardest to keep my shit together, but between feeling uncomfortable all the time (with my roommate often texting me she was going to kill herself or that she hated everyone), getting into psychedelics (I started doing LSD or shrooms once or twice a week) and difficulties focusing on work in a 100% remote work environment, I was losing control. I'd convinced myself I was doing a good job, because people were perceiving me as successful, and I was dating.

In November, I was told that my team was being laid off. Meaning, I had to start applying for jobs again. I felt like I had failed and told myself I REALLY needed to evolve if I wanted to avoid complete failure. I wanted to get a cool job where I designed and developed provocative and creative websites. So, I leaned on the one thing I knew would give me the answers I needed - LSD. My life got very, very trippy around this time. It was incredibly fun, if I'm honest.

I would often spend my evenings painting or illustrating, while watching old Cronenberg movies while tripping. If you haven't seen his films, let me tell you, they are mortally terrifying while your mind is on psychedelics. It felt like my mind was getting sucked in into the movie. I felt it change me. I started regularly having flashbacks of my hallucinations even when I was sober. I was feeling creative. However, I was making no progress in my job hunt or updating my portfolio website.

I'd also started talking to a girl I hooked up with in college. We hadn't seen each other for years, but I remember her being a lot of fun and being relatively normal, so when she hit me up, I was excited to meet up.

She came over one fateful weekend, and we talked for a while, reflecting on the past and talking about our future. She was a mechanical engineer and was actually making more money than me at the time, which I thought was really cool. Later, the topic of psychedelics came up, where we both found we shared an interested in. She asked if I had any, which I said yes - so she suggested we take some that night. I was hesitant at first but gave in after considering how much fun it would be. Plus, I'd never tripped with a girl during a date before. We ended up staying up the entire night, having sex and doing art, back and forth until 6 AM. Was this love (spoiler alert: drug love is never real love).

We started dating and she was now basically living with me. We were high 95% of the time, between smoking weed, doing LSD and the new drug on the block, Ketamine. The same roommate I mentioned before hated her, and I resented her for hating my gf. She even told me my gf tried hitting on her, which I didn't believe for a second, due to her history of causing drama.

The thing is, I've never connected with another soul as deeply as I did with this new girl, and she reciprocated the same feelings. Even though it was likely due to the drugs, it felt authentic. She had come out to me as being bisexual shortly after we started dating and told me about her ex-gf, who was emotionally and physically abusive to her. I accepted her.

She also told me she's interested in having a threesome, which sounded awesome, but also made me feel kind of uncomfortable. I told her I'm open to it, but only after dating longer.

This also opened up conversation around some repressed childhood memories from each of us. I confessed that when I was 7, I had a friend convince me to do sexual acts with him - and it turns out she had a similar thing happen to her. I never considered the impact this experience had on my life.

However, on New Years, everything took a dark turn. We had tickets to an EDM festival that went from New Years Eve to New Years, and we, of course, took LSD beforehand. I was looking forward to it. I still had my senses about me, but she seemed like a completely different person. I remember us going into a merch shop where the shopkeeper started hitting on her. I trusted her though, so I didn't do anything as to not cause a scene. 30 seconds later, I looked back, and I saw the two of them making out, passionately. Seeing that while tripping absolutely broke my heart, so I walked away.

She caught up to me, asking me ""what's wrong?"". She genuinely didn't think she was doing anything wrong. I was hurt, I felt betrayed. Was this what it felt like to be cheated on? Regardless, I was determined to have a fun time, so I told her ""I'm going to find my friends, and you can do whatever the fuck you want, I don't care"". She wanted to stay with me. I couldn't understand. Either way, the rest of the night felt very weird and trippy, like an Eric Andre skit, mixed with demonic imagery, half-naked people, hypersexuality, and heavy bass dubstep. I gave into it all and simply let the waves carry me.

I never trusted her the same, yet I didn't want to leave her. I thought we could build the trust back up again. The first two weeks of January, we didn't leave my room at all. She constantly called out of work and ended up getting fired. I realized that she was not mentally well, nor was I. I can only characterize those 2 weeks as a mutually shared psychotic episode. We would keep flipping between sex, hate, love, fighting, crying, and laughing. It also got pseudo-spiritual, and we'd often talk about demons, and hate for religion.

Afterwards, I found out she was sexting numerous people on Snapchat, including old men, in an attempt to make money. I was so delirious at this point, I didn't have any kind of strong reaction, except for feeling a deep hatred for her, while still loving her all the same.

She kept living with me for another 3 weeks. My room was a disaster. There was paint all over my sheets, clothes and walls; it constantly smelled like urine mixed with incense; and there were random boxes everywhere. Whenever I left and came back to the room, you could literally feel the air in the room change - almost on a spiritual level.

Our relationship ended during a cruise with my family. On the 2nd morning of the cruise, I woke up to find her gone. I texted her asking where she was, and she said she'd been up all night. I asked her to come back. I was suspicious as hell. She looked like a mess and laid on the bed. I used this moment to check her phone, where I again found out she'd been sexting more people.

I freaked out and started yelling at her. I'll never forget her face in that moment. She looked like a scared child, almost like she was mocking me. I could tell she was high on something. Plus, there was 0 doubt in my mind that the both of us were not mentally stable. She ran out of our room, and I stayed. I texted my mom and sister and told them everything.

Apparently, when she ran out, she ran into multiple people, leading her to be confined by security due to their perception of her being a ""risk to herself and others"". While confined, she had a full-fledge mental breakdown, and I sympathized with her. Was this my fault? Did this happen because I yelled at her? I felt like shit.

Security gave her two options: either stayed confined until the end of the cruise, or disembark early at the next stop, Cabo. If she disembarked, I'd need to go with her. If I refused, she'd have to stay the remainder of the trip.

I felt like I owed her, so I offered to disembark, even though it would mean foregoing a fun vacation with my family. Plus, Carnival offered to pay for 1 night at a hotel and a flight (just for me) back to the United States.

I offered to buy her a ticket to go back with me, but also made it clear that our relationship is over and that she is not welcome back at my place after moving her stuff out. However, she refused. She decided to stay in Mexico, despite my pleading. I told her she needs to get help and she has no money, and once I go, I can't help her. She insisted, so I gave up trying to get her to see reason.

I said goodbye and left to the airport. I never saw her again, nor did her family. We stayed in contact for a week afterwards, where I found out she apparently got involved with the Cartel (apparently Cabo has a significant cartel presence, since a lot of tourist money goes through there) and told her she needs to get the fuck out ASAP before she reaches a point of no return. I bought her a ticket, and she didn't even use it. I completely gave up on her at this point. She threatened to kill me after that, so I blocked her.

That was in February, this year. 5 months ago.

**END OF BACKSTORY**

=================================================

It's taken me quite some time to finally get past my trauma. The first few months back in the states, I was constantly high on weed and ketamine, where I'd spend my days having conversations with ChatGPT and generating photos with Midjourney. The intercross between the uncanny valley experience with AI, the sudden change of lifestyle, and the fact that money is draining from my account at a rapid rate drove a wedge between me and reality. I thought I was developing schizophrenia.

I've finally sobered up since then, and so, the ""schizophrenia"" symptoms have also dissipated, which has eased some concerns. I haven't had a drink of alcohol since the cruise, and only smoke weed at night, if at all; and if I do, it's much less than I used to before.

Even so, my life has still gone to shit. I've barely been able to keep up with my bills, and I'm two months behind on my debt, between personal loans, school loans and credit cards (totaling over $40k). I'm even considering filing bankruptcy just to escape the endless phone calls.

My ADHD has spiked. In the past months, I've found myself mindlessly consuming TV and video games. I barely ever leave my apartment. I've managed to pull together enough energy to finally redo my portfolio website but I'm lacking any direction. My passion for improving my life and my career has left me. I've had numerous interviews all end in disappointment.

Often times, I think about committing suicide, but I'm too scared of experiencing death. Plus, I'd rather keep the suffering to myself vs passing it on to my loved ones, who've done so much for me.

My lease ends in 30 days, and it seems like I'm going back to my parents once again. While I think I'll benefit from being with family, I can't help but feel like I've fucked up immensely.

Some days I think I'm too far gone, and the years of substance abuse and procrastination have finally caught up to me. Any optimism I do get is often short-lived and killed off after scrolling twitter for 5 minutes and seeing the sad state of the world.

I know what I have to do, but for some reason I feel incapable of it. In fact, I've tried going to the gym regularly and eating better, but each time is short-lived, and I end up snapping back to laziness - which further establishes my incapability.

I feel doomed, but I know I still have time. I'm starting a full-time job in 10 days, however it's just another call center job. I'm not sure how long I can take it, but I'm determined to make it work in the meantime until I hopefully find my dream again.

The weight of it all is so heavy. How do I forgive myself? How do I move forward, considering the fact I've been here before and failed multiple times?

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for listening to me vent. This is the first time I've shared all this information at once, so I hope it all makes sense. If anyone has any advice as to how I can move forward, I'd appreciate it.

"The laws of inertia are at play here. The bigger and heavier the boulder the harder it is to get it to stop rolling once its in motion.

You have a lot of stuff thats holding you back thats why it seems like when you make attempts to change you dont see enough results so you feel repeatedly defeated and give up. A vicious cycle.

Change happens slow, you cant stare in the mirror and notice your hair growing its only after a long time you will notice change. A small dripping stream of water can cut through stone if given enough time. Dont let lack of results discourage you. The result shouldnt be your goal, your goal should be the attempt each day, if you tried, you succeeded, and with that mindset, growth is inevitable.


You dont need to obsess too much over whether or not youve fucked yourself over with past drug use, thats like when moms would tell their children ""dont make funny faces too long if you do your face will get stuck like that""... we have more capacity to change than we give ourselves credit for.

You just need a positive feedback loop, right now youre in a negative feedback loop, and those feel like quicksand. Do little pragmatic things throughout the day, small victories. Make your bed, that could be a small domino you tip over in the morning that has a massive chain reaction. Do intermittent fasting, that keeps your mind sharper and less foggy. Get sunlight for atleast an hour each day. Focus on awesome sleep hygiene, stay hydrated.

Get a hobby that has growth in it. I personally like art,  i feel good when i feel like im growing and progressing, it means im on the right path, its affirming and calming whe  you have a hobby as a passion and your skill in that hobby is improving. Small victories.

"Wow, you characterized it perfectly. 

Thank you for taking the time to give me feedback and action to take. 

I'm trying my best to get into a positive feedback loop, but it can be so difficult at times. I find myself dreaming again since I've slowed down my weed smoking considerably. 

Typically, these dreams feature a lot of people from my past, an ideal present or just an all-around surreal fantasy of a better life. However, I often wake up to see what my life actually is like, and it feels like a nightmare. So, it's been a double-edged sword lol. 

I'm going to be moving back in with family for a few months, starting in 30 days. I think this is good, and I want to use that time and the positive feedback from them to focus on being able to respond to these feelings in a more positive and constructive way, with the plan of getting in a more positive feedback loop, as you suggested. 

Plus, as a fellow artist, maybe I need to focus more on that too. I think that'll help a lot. 

Thanks again :)"	losingmyminddotcom	follow-up	na	na	na	0.013774581253528595	weak	strong	no	na	selfhelp
"I hate a lot about my current self.

For context, I'm a 15 year old dude. I try to convince myself that I'm just going through a phase, which is why I hate myself. Maybe I'm right. But still, I don't want to be like this. I need your help.

You see, I'm into stuff that people like to look down upon, which includes anime, manga, and other things that people view as ""degeneracy"". I also write fanfiction as my hobby, and I think this is extremely pathetic. People often say shit like ""touch grass"" to guys that have similar hobbies, and I'm starting to see why. Is liking this stuff really alright? I mean, anime normalizes the oversexualization of women, as well as making jokes about ""lolis"" or underaged girls, or at least girls who look like minors. 

Aside from that, I like to make fake scenarios in my head to make myself happy. I also think this is extremely pathetic. Am I an incel? Probably. 

Another hobby of mine is sharing posts on Facebook. I really love memes and stuff, so whenever I see one, I share. However, I always overshare posts, leading to me sharing about a hundred per day. And I think people are fed up with my horrible sense of humor, and probably weirded out by all the anime girls they see on their feed courtesy of me.

I could have better hobbies, but I'm just not interested. Sports? Pass. Chess? Pass. Playing instruments? Pass. Dancing? Pass. The stuff that are socially acceptable and considered ""normal"" for people my age don't appeal to me, which is another reason I think I'm a loser.

Lastly, this all started back on seventh grade when I told someone who was fed up with schoolwork to ""shut the hell up and stop being lazy"" which led to me getting cancelled online. This person was also going through some mental health issues, and I just disregarded all of that. It really put into perspective just how much of an asshole I was back then, and I think I still am. I think I'm insensitive, always laughing at dark jokes and jokes targeted towards minorities despite telling myself to change every single time. The worst part is there were times were I didn't regret laughing at those jokes. I also stay silent whenever my friends vent about important stuff, because I know deep down that whatever will come out of my mouth will offend them and ruin our relationship.

I really want to get rid of this mindset. I'm not depressed or anything, but any more and I might start becoming depressed. Ironic, isn't it? I laugh at people with mental health issues and I might just start developing one. How do I convince myself that I'm not a loser/depressed person? Unless I actually am, of course."

"Hey bro.  Saw your post and saved it, thought about you just now and decided to come back.

There‚Äôs so much to respond to here, and I think people don‚Äôt even know where to start.  That‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing, because you‚Äôre only saying bad stuff about yourself but you‚Äôre demonstrating good things.  You‚Äôre obviously self reflecting in an honest manner, which many people fail to do even as adults.  You also showed in passing that you‚Äôre probably pretty good at school.  And you have people talking to you and opening up‚Äî why?  They probably see something in you.

Stop thinking about what you shouldn‚Äôt do and start thinking about what you need to do.  You do this already with school, right?  You need to complete the assignment, so you do it.  You need to pass the test, so you do it.

You want:
- academic/career success
- friends/peer respect
- health
- fun

It seems like you‚Äôre successful academically, hit hard by judgment from peers even though some of them approach you and you hold back, while you reject physical fitness and judge yourself for having fun.

Work out like it‚Äôs a class you take seriously.  I don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt like sports or dancing or history, you‚Äôll thank me later.  Do it.

Listen to people when they talk, and think about what they need to hear and what they want to hear.  Those are two different things.  Stop thinking about how you are judging yourself, think about them.

If you‚Äôre having fun, then have fun.  100 memes a day is way too much but if you‚Äôre having fun then fucking enjoy it and stop caring what people think.  If they don‚Äôt like it, then don‚Äôt share it with them.  Remove them from the distro.  If you have time for 100 a day then I‚Äôm jealous of you and your free time for fun.  Just don‚Äôt let that cut into your time for other shit, right?  Get your work done first.  Go to the gym before you send memes."

"Anytime i see basically anyone i feel like they have a better Personality than me, that are cooler and better and funnier. 

How do i challenge this thought?

i know everyone has their own unique qualities, everyone has their own struggles and that everyone is different from one another. Yet i still struggle with this. 

I tell my self I need to be Happy with who i am, and what Personality i have, and keep working on myself to be the best version of my self. 

I think i look for External validation/Attention to prove to my self that im cool/funny/intelligent/witty rather than seeking my own Validation. Its like Harder to believe my own validation than others, Even when others give that Validation its for a brief time..

Last Night my brain was telling me to Download Social media apps to sext or look at porn, i instead meditated for a while and then exercised then watched some funny YouTube videos.. 

I realized i was thinking like that so i could get others validation/attention rather than depend on my self to be Happy. I was Bored and my brain was looking for the easy way out."	Butcher__1	post	23.090830688052165	female	White	0.053127456456422806	na	na	na	2	selfhelp
"With the realization you've made I think that's already making it a long way.  

Do you think that downloading social media apps or looking at porn results in validation/attention? O.o that seems just like a logical fallacy.  

Like I have social media and do indulge in 18+ media, probably more often than most \^\^'  

Sounds great that you did healthy options instead, I want to be healthy and is most of the time, but I think everybody needs and takes breaks.  

I feel like you've slightly fallen in the ""main character syndrome"" trap, which is an easy one to fall into, everybody does once in a while. But you gotta realize, unless you decidedly make other people feel bad, id it seems like the people around you enjoy your company, how is that a bad personality?  

I can be cringe, and like to tease my friends, possibly a bit too much \^\^', I'm quite blunt in a lot of what I say, but still have a pretty big circle of pretty close friends.  

Everyone are cunts once in a while, some more often than others. Everyone indulges in some kinda vice, some more healthy vices than others, some hide it better than others. But everyone in the world has a just as complex life as you do, even though you might feel unique and possibly alone in your predicament I can guarantee you there has been someone else in a 99% similar situation as well.

"I want to become a politician. After researching on the internet I know that one of the ways to help victims sometimes is through some politicians trying to get or advocate for the death penalty for certain crimes. 

When it comes to really awful crimes that have been committed I do feel like the death penalty is the proper punishment. On one hand I feel like I find it very meaningful and I am passionate about making sure that good victims get justice. 

I want to clarify that I am not saying any victim deserved to have what happened to them. However since I don't know any of the victims in these cases I wouldn't feel successful in my life fighting and advocating extremely hard for a bad victim to get justice. 

When i say a bad victim I mean someone that was a horrible person who was mistreating everyone around them and being a complete asshole to people when they were alive. A bad victim to me is someone who was completely awful while they were here. A person that if I was to have met them in my life I would have hated them.

I try to assume that in every situation of a crime you had good victims and bad victims around 50/50 so it evens out. However I still wouldn't feel comfortable advocating and fighting so hard for bad victims in this world. "	NightShout	post	7.588295759418543	female	White	0.9881730675697327	na	na	na	2	selfhelp

I'm 26 years old and full of regret about never moving out of my parents house when I could have spent my youth in a new city, growing and developing instead of stagnating. I never even went to university. I feel I am too old now to have the youthful adventure, partying and exploration I have been longing for. I feel as though I am at an age where I need to start taking things seriously. I'm so lost and I don't know what to do.

I mean it‚Äôs actually not too late. 26 is young AF. What you could do is go to the nearest city near you and explore on your own. Go to the museums, theatres, parks by yourself. The thought here is to get used to exploring new places by yourself and getting out in the world. Idk where you are but if you‚Äôre in the NE USA citys are very walkable. Also take community college classes. The moving to a different city is possible and you can do it anytime, really you have to build confidence in yourself to do things alone because a lot of life is time alone.

"Recently, I(22M) got my hair cut too short and my hairline(pretty bad at my age) has made me really insecure. I was growing out my hair to cover it up but now it that it's gone, it feels that my made-up self esteem had gone with it. This made me realise how fragile my self esteem was.

I've always had self esteem issues, always cynical, never really satisfied with myself. I'm so lonely but/because I'm incapable of trust and love. I feel like I'm devoid of real emotions. I feel that I'm ugly and I'll probably die alone. 

The only motivation I have to keep going are my parents just because I don't want them to suffer through my death. I don't know what to live for, apart from my parents. I've tried to keep myself occupied with work and hobbies but the depression always seems to lurking, waiting to strike whenever you're not expecting it to. I've embraced the fact that depression never truly goes away and it makes me feels like I should start being happy with unhappiness and self sabotage and delight in throwing away any chance to be happy.

Happiness is a mindset but I chose to be sad. That's why no amount of help will suffice because I will not change.

"**TL;DR ‚Äì I do not understand why I, an individual recovering from chronic isolation, cannot feel connection in spite of opportunity and willingness. Positive social relationships do not move me at all and I still feel separate from others.**

I recently did a lot of research into long-term social isolation and its consequences, and what has become clear to me is that this has been something that I have suffered from for a very long time. Chronic isolation in which a person loses all hope of being reaccepted into the group can apparently lead to deliberate self-seclusion as well as heightened acts of aggression and violence, all of which only serve reinforce their social circumstances. I should mention that I am Autistic, and I have been in a self-imposed hermit-like state for about a decade. Ever since puberty I have struggled with violent impulses, rage and a general hatred of other human beings. From the ages of about 10 to 13 in particular I was in a situation where one parent was absent, my peer environment was brutally hostile, and the other parent had become so overwhelmed by the difficulties that I presented that they essentially made me feel rejected and worthless as well. During that time, I felt as though I had been kicked out of Humanity.

To this day I feel like something inhuman, like some creature or wretch. Most reading this will probably never have a vivid picture of what I am talking about, only understanding it as some nebulous and vaguely foreign concept, but for me it is the single most vivid and exquisitely clear experience that I have ever felt. It claws and tears at my organs when I hear someone else say that the most isolated they have ever been was during COVID lockdown. For me, lockdown genuinely was unnoticeable and very, very far from the most isolated that I have ever felt. I have grown up without a sense of familial, platonic, ethnic, national, gender-based or even species-based affiliation. The very thought carries a dull pain, and the world seems like an infernal place as a consequence.

 Nevertheless, my situation has become less extreme recently as my antisocial tendencies recede and I become more self-reflective. I have found motivation to reach out to others, and to take action to improve my life. I have endeavoured to socialise (albeit almost exclusively through the internet), finish my education and make some money here and there, with the ultimate goal of leaving the home for which I feel only disgust and contempt at this point.

In this experience, however, I have discovered something that puzzles me very deeply. I am calm. I no longer hate any of you. I am open to and desire connection, truly. *I believed that it was possible for me,* at least momentarily. I now talk to my family and to strangers. I am honest with them about my psychological situation. People hear how isolated I have been, how isolated I still feel. They hear about my idiosyncratic beliefs and interests, about my sincere plan for world domination and they understand and do not judge me. I find kindness, softness and acceptance. I find commonality. I find others who love history and geopolitics, others who are lonely, others who are eccentric in various ways. But it makes no difference. At the end of the day, I still feel in my bones that we are not the same. The gulf cannot be bridged.

Why is this? Why is it that, no matter how much I have in common with someone, no matter how kind and honest they are with me, no matter how much I love their company, I still cannot internalise that we are the same? All I want is an answer to this question, so that I understand what is going on inside my own head.

I think it might be that I have not really met many who truly understand the type of extreme social and emotional isolation that I have experienced, and those that do, well we may not have much else in common and they may come across as desperate for social validation. So either the person is too dysfunctional for a sincere connection, or they do not understand that part of me that most desperately yearns to be understood.

Any insight in this regard would be much appreciated. Either way, thanks for reading."	Mental_Mausoleum	post	28.574235993914293	male	White	0.008105337619781494	na	na	na	1	selfhelp

>how did you overcome this?

For every situation in your life, imagine that your brain has built a bridge for dealing with it.  Every time that situation happens, whether it's something you experience or actions you take, you cross that bridge, and as you do so, your brain builds the bridge larger & stronger, so that you get better & faster at doing it.  This is why habits are so hard to break, and why childhood events leave such an impact on us!

Now imagine there's a hula-hoop around each bridge.  That's your **boundary** around that particular topic.  We can't destroy the bridge, so if we want to change, we have to build a NEW bridge!  That means we have to change the angle of that circular boundary to make it BIGGER to encompass TWO bridges now!

The old bridge will *always* be there.  That's why in AA they say you can never go back to a bar...because that old bridge still exists in your mind, it's way too easy to switch lanes & go back to thinking, doing, and feeling the way we did in the past!  A good starting point is to learn about self-honor:

So there are two topics to consider:

1. Scripts
2. Relapse

For starters, the way we feel is broken up into two parts:

1. Feelings
2. Emotions

Feelings are things we have, like hunger, pain, or attraction.  Emotions are quick-save desktop shortcuts to thoughts we had once, often automatically.  We can influence our feelings (ex. we can eat periodically throughout the day instead of waiting a long time to eat so that we don't get ""hangry"", haha!) & we can change our emotions by changing how we think!

So by changing the script in our heads about a particular situation, we can practice our new script until it becomes second nature!  That script is what the bridge is all about...the original bridge we experience will *always* be there, which is especially difficult for addictions like smoking or drinking, or impressionable points of our lives like having difficult childhood experiences, but we can choose to build a new bridge & start strengthening it by practicing over time!

Because it takes practice, we are going to relapse, and that's okay because we are human!  We basically have 3 options:

1. Perfection
2. Progress
3. Process

Perfection is hard to achieve because we don't have the energy for it lol.  Steady progress is also hard to achieve because we're humans & sustaining effort over time is REALLY difficult!  So what we really need is a new PROCESS, aka a checklist!  That's what the script in our head that our brain generates emotions from is!  That's what those mental bridges are made of...practice over time using scripts, to generate ""automaticity"" (i.e. making things second-nature!).  The basic process is:

1. Pick a specific situation to work on
2. Identify your default reaction (this can take some real work!)
3. Think of new options that you could engage in...how you want to think, how you want to feel, what you want to say, what you want to do.
4. Pick an option & start practicing!  Don't expect overnight, instant results.  Don't expect perfection.  Don't even expect steady progress!  Just design a new bridge & practice crossing it.  If you fall off the wagon, get back up when you have the energy to do so, and start using it again to get things done!

Things can get into your hard drive, so to speak, when you're young. That's what you see vestiges of now, even though you're a grown-up.

"part 2/2

Here's the very first script I recommend adopting:

* You have intrinsic value simply for existing

This is just a fact, despite how we feel!  Every single person on earth is equally valid.  You don't have to have positive feelings to believe this! You can feel apathetic or even negative, and that's OK!  Here's the second script I recommend adopting:

* We can ""proceed anyway"" *despite* how we feel

Maybe our self-esteem, self-worth, and self-confidence is in the gutters for the day...but we can still pretend like we care & still put in the effort to move things along a bit for the day!  I do an awful lot of tasks while excessively complaining to myself LOL.  Third:

* Recognize that, with effort, time heals everything

In time, the power of your father's voice will fade.  His voice may never completely go away, but one of the most powerful things I learned in recent years was this:

* We can't change our past, but we CAN change our *relationship* with the past

This means that:

* You can accept that you are an adult who is capable of changing how they feel about events that happened in the past
* You can accept that your father was a flawed individual with demons of his own
* You can accept that your personal situation has given you a unique empathy that not many people have
* You can accept that you now have a more motivated position to define who you are & who you want to be because you know what the consequences of the impact of negative behavior is on the people around you

There's a beautiful Japanese concept called Kintsugi, which is the ancient art of repairing broken pottery with gold:

* [https://mymodernmet.com/kintsugi-kintsukuroi/](https://mymodernmet.com/kintsugi-kintsukuroi/)

This creates something unique & something strong, despite having a past that would have otherwise left things broken.  Every single human being on earth goes through a unique trial that is specifically difficult for them.  We can either stay broken, or we can choose to pick up the pieces & let those experiences empower us to become stronger!

The reality is that no one is coming to rescue us, so we have to rescue ourselves, which isn't a bad thing, but simply an opportunity to decide who WE really want to be!  The great myth in life, especially career-wise, is that we have to go out to ""find"" ourselves, or that we HAVE to let the past DEFINE ourselves, when really, it's our job to DECIDE who we want to be!

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/p1pui8/comment/h8fgfqw/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/p1pui8/comment/h8fgfqw/?context=3)

Once we're in a position where we're ready & able to taken full ownership of managing the consequences in our lives (because we're not responsible for EVERYTHING that happens TO us in life, such as difficult childhoods!), then we can decide if we want to choose a reactive way or proactive way of living our lives:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/hsp/comments/y2jy7p/comment/is4blri/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/hsp/comments/y2jy7p/comment/is4blri/?context=3)

This is a lifelong process!  The good news is that eventually the many bridges in your life will have parallel bridges that YOU have built proactively, by choice, which is a process similar to building a Lego set over time.  And sometimes you'll relapse & fall back into your old ways of thinking & feeling, and that's okay, because you're CHOOSING to do better & have started to work on DESIGNING a better life for yourself!

As long as your current perspective of your troubled history is the ONLY script available for you, then that's the one your brain will default to!  That's why we have to audit situations one by one, come up with new solutions, practice them, and accept that we won't be perfect at thinking & feeling our way across those new bridges!

But as we work to make our boundaries bigger to encompass more good stuff, we'll improve over time!  Success pretty much just boils down to persistent, aka ""grit"":

"What Do i need to do first, what do i work on first? 
there is just so much advice that i get overwhelmed. 

What do i need to Focus on?

What should i do? keep focusing on self improvement? and find something that i enjoy? which is like low chance with me living in iraq lol. 

im meditating, exercising and working thats about it. idk if im on the right path. i ask my self everyday whats most important to me i barely get an answer. im trying to not take life too seriously. since its a journey not a race. but i dont want to waste time either.

I dont Know what i want Yet, There is Self improvement, College, Making Friends, Hobbies, Goals, Dreams, Ambitions, Passions, Meditating, Exercising, Reading, Existential Crises at 21, Thinking about Life, Death, History of Mankind, Creating something for Society, Being Creative and a lot more, i feel like i haven't achieved much. im in College studying Computer science and Learning to be a Mechanic, i want to do more but idk what

i dont have any hobbies outside , but idk where to start and there aren't clubs near me to join or have any friends to ask them


 
i really dont know what i want to be honest, i dont want a GF, because dating not allowed, have to do it secretly and i dont want that, even if i wantwd a GF i couldn't get one, im either ""Super fake Nice Guy"" or an ""Asshole"" mostly im an asshole who makes jokes that are like swords. i cant be witty or funny or charming or anything, i feel like no one likes me, maybe im too harsh on my self and i realize that. 

Maybe im overthinking all of this, i honestly don't know, but im feeling motivated to work on my self and not depend anyone for my happiness 

recently i deleted my social medias, not texting anyone online, just focusing on my self, and learning my work better. trying to find out my likes and dislikes, who i like or who i dislike, what excites me and whats fun instead of just Porn/Texting forever

i got a lot of Advice, a lot said i need to improve my self esteem, and that my self esteem is low

I know i need to stop basing my self worth on how many friends i have or how many conversations im having, its like im playing with my self esteem by basing it on external things and it will never be enough, How many conversations till am convinced that im worthy? cool? funny? intelligent? I dont know What to base it on either, i know it has to be Internal validation, Give Validation to My self

Some said to work on my People Pleasing habits, but sometimes i dont even realize if im doing them, And ask my self Why Am i doing Them.

Some said Need to work on Confidence/Self Love and be Kinder to my self

Some said that im putting way too much focus on  making friends and there is more to life than Just friends or Texting girls online and i know that. i dont know what else to be My Goals.

some said Therapy, but its Near impossible to get it here. 

some said to think about my People pleasing habits and why i do them

some said to go Outside more, Get hobbies, try new things, im trying my best to find a hobby.
my hobbies can't be Porn/Texting girls online for the rest of my Life

I enjoy astronomy, sports, movies, shows, video games, star gazing, music, traveling, exercising, meditating, reading, learning a new skill
would like to do a lot more. Planning to buy an a musial instrument 

right now im learning some care engineering, also trying to observe my surroundings without judgement, and observe my thoughts without Judgement 

some said to work improving in conversations, and be interested in others not just for attention, its like i only talk to others when im bored. Like not Truly interested in others because i don't know how to be interested, Maybe im not interested in my own life maybe its reflects that

Besides that i don't even really know what i should say. or what to talk about

i send ""How is it going"" online and it goes nowhere 

but living in a small town in iraq, its boring here.
just a few weeks ago i found a job in a big city, trying to experience more there

im 21 in college, finished my first year with good grades, met a lot of new people there but i dont think Any are friends of mine. just acquaintances.

but im trying to find other ways to make my self happy that dont depend on External Validation or Basing my self worth on how others react Or how many texts i recieve, i would get Mad after i would send long messages and other would say 1 word, Made me feel like i had nothing to offer or they didnt care about me or like me.

Some said to Meditate and find my weaknesses and strengths but i dont know my Strengths, or How to find them, i know my weakness (People pleasing) but I dont Know how to Fix this Either.

I did a personality test and it said i was a ""Architect"" and my strengths was (Determined, Independent, Informed, Rational, Original, Curious) and my weaknesses were (Combative, Overly Critical, Dismissive of Emotions, Arrogant, Socially Clueless)

And it said that im hard to befriend, why is that? its really hard for me to make friends, Maybe I'm trying to hard?

its true, sometimes im Arrogant or come off as Arrogant but i admit my mistakes, and Im Overly critical of my self. for example being Mad at my self for not knowing what to talk about or for not having friends and sometimes i get Jealous of Others having friends and being good at conversations i want to be Good at Conversations 
But most times im a difficult person to know 

And it said that my Strengths are often Misunderstood, But i know i haven't reached my full potential Yet

I been trying to Meditate and observe my thoughts, i picture my self standing and observing the thoughts like im a Statue and not affected by the thoughts, i dont try to engage with them or Observe them

I know its always me chasing others, but i have no idea what to talk about with people 

I dont want to chase people but i also dont want to be alone forever. 

Most times with people its good when i meet them, then after a little time i run out of things to say. or run out of questions. 

Its like Impossible to make friends for me. But i dont want my Goals to be Friends/Porn forever. 

i want to do more, a lot more. 

im sick of Being a ""Fake Nice Guy for Approval"" sick of people pleasing, really sick of Porn. been doing it for 10 years. like I want to get rid of addiction. but its hard to find alternatives."	Butcher__1	post	20.447281863539864	female	White	0.008356490172445774	na	na	na	1	selfhelp

I honestly don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm typing this , I‚Äôm embarrassed to even admit this but I just need to vent . whatever choice I make , it seems to be the wrong one. Whenever I talk to people I seem to either weird them out or offend them, it‚Äôs why I mostly stay quiet , I‚Äôm not trying to be offensive or weird but when I start talking I feel as if I‚Äôm already a pain to the person listening. This isn‚Äôt anything recent either , for as long as I can remember I‚Äôve tried to be a person of few needs as to not inconvenience my parents or any of my friends. yes I‚Äôve managed to make friends but I talk to them even less now, no they haven‚Äôt lost interest with me I just don‚Äôt talk or know what to say other than small talk. I‚Äôm not trying to be a loner I hate being alone but I can‚Äôt help but feel like a burden or a failure. I know it‚Äôs probably not the case but I don‚Äôt step up for most thing or take initiative for anything work , family or friend related. And when I do rarely step up I mess something up and so many negative thoughts go through my head and a feeling of dred course through me manifesting in a voice in my head saying ‚Äúgoddamn it not this guy again‚Äù. Afterwards I‚Äôm left dejected and just wanting the day to end. Just a few days ago at work I was given a task to complete but got turned around with what the project was to be , either A or B (rather not say my work just to keep it private) but I felt so useless especially when a co-worker had to help me because I didn‚Äôt know exactly what to do and wasn‚Äôt quick enough to complete the project by myself. My boss even conveyed to them that they needed to help me to make sure it was done in time, I wouldn‚Äôt have minded but the disappointed tones from both made it feel like I was deadweight ,i don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs just how I feel, the project was done but I had felt like the biggest inconvenience to happen that day , I know I‚Äôm blowing this way outta proportion but there‚Äôs no other way to say it. Idk what the word exactly is to say I‚Äôm lacking , maybe fortitude or confidence? It‚Äôs either those or something else that I‚Äôm maybe just overlooking. I should mention that I‚Äôm not a quitter , while I feel like the most massive screw up when shit does happen, I‚Äôm not gonna cave and quit but this feeling of unworthiness just gets to me so much that I have to say this. I probably didn‚Äôt communicate this well either ,the first half probably doesn‚Äôt even match up with the second half but if people can relate to this or if anyone has an answer or something reassuring I would very much like to hear it.

"Here are a few of my thoughts. I first of all see two issues: one being perceived awkward social interactions with coworkers, and the second being with being a strong team member at work. Since I have limited information to go by, I will do my best to make suggestions based off my assumptions. Please disregard anything that you think is irrelevent

1. As an awkward person I learned that any sort of niche interest is not good work conversation. Take note in how people respond to your conversations. For example, when I told my coworkers I was putting in a garden, a few of them perked up and had a lot to say about gardening. So I knew that was a safe topic. When I talked about tarot cards though not a lot of people perked up or said much about it. So I knew that conversation was not the most interesting to them. Though at my old job it made me popular. Instead of thinking 'I am a failure' I simply observe without judgement and think 'ah hah, I found the boundary'. Small talk is useful in that it helps us find the boundaries. We are not bad people because we come up against them, they are useful for us so we know what to do next time. 
2. As someone in the healthcare field, I can tell you if you are willing to learn, people are willing to teach. Ask questions, take initiative where you can, get in there and do things. I do not know the nature of your job. However if someone is helping you all I can emphasize is pay attention and try to get that hands on experience. Show you are engaged and you are wanting to improve. For me it meant I would go home and learn about something related to my field.

Part of being anxious attached is the so called ""hyper vigilance"" so you notice little things like changes in facial impressions or gestures and it makes you feel uncomfortable.

Also if you neglect your needs you will become a needy person in the end. Because everything about you screams ""notice me"".

What does it mean to focus on self? Does it mean be selfish and no longer think or care of other's?	WestSelf4394	post	44.900755083229996	female	White	0.9939910769462585	na	na	na	8	selfhelp

"It doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that. What it does mean is removing any toxic people or ‚Äúdead weights‚Äù from your life that hold you back.

If your friends spend their time playing video games or partying, focusing on yourself is you opting out of that to hit the gym and move on with your life."	WestSelf4394	reply	na	na	na	0.9939910769462585	no	no	no	na	selfhelp
">What does it mean to focus on self? Does it mean be selfish and no longer think or care of other's?

This is an important distinction to understand!  Here's the core concept:

* You have to put YOURSELF first

However, this does NOT mean being self-centered or selfish!  Rather, it means practicing **self-honor:**

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/visxe2/comment/idfvadc/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/visxe2/comment/idfvadc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Think about this:

* If you are tired, everything is going to be a slog
* If you are sick, you can't really help with anything
* If you are broke, you can't help yourself or other people
* If your energy is shot, you can't do the work required to help other people
* If you don't feel good, then it's easy to take it out on other people & be mean to everyone else in your life

If you *don't* put yourself first & make your health & well-bring your number one priority, then you're actually shortchanging how much you can help other people, *including* yourself!  **Your primary job in life** is to take care of your own physical, emotional, and mental health to the best of your ability give your health & circumstances in life, because no one else is going to do it for you, and because you can't help yourself or anyone else when you're behind the curve!  We need to get on top of our sleep:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/kaidomac/comments/s15jmk/sleep\_apnea\_sleeping\_system/

Statistically, 41% of Americans are obese, 73% are overweight, and 133 out of 331 million Americans are diabetic.  We need to learn how to eat for good health & for high energy so that we have the power to bring about change in our lives:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/d0rxv6/comment/ezebxg9/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/d0rxv6/comment/ezebxg9/?context=3)

We have a LOT of areas to work on!  Some of those include:

* Improving our personal organization
* Getting more education to be able to provide a greater contribution using our natural & often undiscovered talents & interests
* Creating a personal finance system that allows us to be philanthropic, whether it's being able to donate money, goods, or our time, effort, and energy to good causes, whether it's coaching a Little League team & helping out kids or a donating to a charity or helping out at a local soup kitchen or whatever floats your boat! 

If YOU don't get enough sleep, feed your body well, exercise your body, and manage your stress levels, then there's a BIG chance that your body is going to short out, become apathetic, and go into low-energy mode, which is a REALLY hard trap to escape!  If your goal is to think about & care for others, it's hard to do that when you yourself are run down!

So what ""focusing on yourself"" *really* means is learning about self-respect, learning what it really means, and putting it into practice in order to help both yourself & other people!  Which is all about *boundaries*:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/z5u6sm/comment/ixy4rnr/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/z5u6sm/comment/ixy4rnr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Most people just coast through life, content with what comes their way.  If you want more, then there's ABSOLUTELY more out there for you!

"It means to think inside out, and not the other way round. 

To focus on your thoughts, your way of thinking, your habits, your personality, your mental and physical health, so you can achieve a healthy relationship both with yourself and the world. 

To break out of pattern which forms because of the unconscious programming all until now, and learn to be in the present. 

To be an independent person, and call your thoughts your thoughts, you will have to go through a phase where you come across as though you don't care about others, because you're trying to regain your independence as a person, as it should have always been. 

It will all be normal once you've gained that sense of independence and have broken out of your unhealthy patterns and programming."	WestSelf4394	reply	na	na	na	0.9939910769462585	no	no	no	na	selfhelp

"Sometimes it feels so hard to be around people. I use up my energy with work people that I mostly struggle to find energy outside of work. 
I've been told it takes me a lot to warm up to people in the morning. To me, why does it matter? I hate mornings. I'm not rude or mean. I say hello to people. Just don't talk much more. 
How can I not lose who I am and also cater to others needs? I go to work to do work. Socialising is additional work for me. Work culture dictates I'm the one who must change. What are the steps that won't tire me too much with all other work/conversational demands?"	idontknowthings85	post	28.12746456469517	female	White	0.9985975623130798	na	na	na	5	selfhelp
"It sounds like you might be an introvert if your 'social battery' depletes throughout the day. I work as a nurse and have done all sorts of shifts and work hours. I have met lots of people in the workplace, too and I know a lot of the different personalities and quirks. Here are my thoughts. 

If you are not a morning person, then I think that is okay. Saying good morning to people is polite, and I bet there are lots of people you work with who are not morning people either. Sometimes adding a smile can make you appear more friendly. Maybe save most of the conversations for the break room later on when you are more awake. As far as needing to change goes, some people appreciate the quieter coworkers in the morning. Honestly I just keep my interactions professional in the morning while waking up. 

One observation I made as an introvert in a very extraverted field is that meaningful conversation does not drain me as much as small talk. If you can direct the conversation towards something interesting with more thought and intellect behind it, note if your energy level."	idontknowthings85	reply	na	na	na	0.9985975623130798	no	strong	no	na	selfhelp
"There's a few things to go over here.  


What is your desired outcome? In the perfect world what do you want?

Secondly when you find what you want obviously it is you who must change. In order to substantiate change you must have boundaries. Accept that people might not like you, why are you fighting for their approval? And also let them know how you feel! 

Learning to communicate is a crucial skill in life. I used to think I was an introvert and now I consider myself neither introverted or extroverted. I am interchangable. Sometimes I want to be alone to think (I love thinking). And secondly I also love being social with friends, making new friends, for work/business. Change the relationship you have with yourself. 

The main block for people is that they won't allow themselves to present who they are completely because they don't love every part of themselves. Get in touch with all those parts of you that you dismiss, the parts you don't like and most of your ""problems"" (I don't like that word, there are only solutions and situations) will go away."	idontknowthings85	reply	na	na	na	0.9985975623130798	weak	no	strong	na	selfhelp

"Ever felt like you're stuck in a never-ending loop of procrastination, to the point where it's crippling your progress?   
Well, that was me not so long ago.   
Deadlines whooshing by, tasks piling up, anxiety through the roof - procrastination had me in a chokehold.  
The problem was I relied too much on intrinsic motivation. I thought, as long as I have the passion and the interest, I can accomplish anything.   
But there are days when you just don't feel it. That's when tasks start piling up.   
I was stuck in this loop until I discovered the concept of extrinsic motivation.  
For those who aren't familiar, extrinsic motivation is what pushes you towards specific outcomes or goals. It's driven by external factors like rewards, recognition, or avoiding negative consequences, not necessarily because you want to do the task.   
It doesn't necessarily make the task more enjoyable, but it sure helps to get it done.  
Here are some ideas from what has worked for me & others around me:   


https://preview.redd.it/u73og2ethr9b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b75b460c6d212b99c305117002041285ae7f8ec2

**1‚Äî Setting SMART goals( Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound)**  
Instead of a vague goal like ""Increase sales,"" you could aim for ""Increase sales by 10% over the next quarter by targeting 5 new major clients in the X industry"".  
**2‚Äî Break big projects into smaller subtasks.**  
Write tasks on sticky notes and remove them as you complete them, or tick them off in a digital daily planner app like Sunsama.   
Both methods provide a visual way to monitor your progress and boost motivation.  
**3‚Äî Allocate specific time slots for tasks and even breaks.**  
Allocating time slots for tasks creates mini-deadlines, boosting extrinsic motivation.  
Incorporating breaks also serves as a rewarding system, further enhancing this motivation.  
**4‚Äî Keep a ""Done List"".**  
At the end of the day, write down all the tasks you've completed. This offers a sense of accomplishment, which can motivate you to continue progressing. Again, you can use a daily planner like Sunsama to track this list and do a daily check-in, automatically.  
Do you have any favorite tactics or apps that keep your motivation high and save you from procrastination? Would love to know."	samayash	post	26.973760505623147	female	White	0.001434227218851447	na	na	na	1	selfhelp

"Hello everyone! :)

I thought this subreddit might be a good place to find individuals who are currently struggling with anxiety, depression, and/or stress and would like to try mindfulness! If this is not allowed, please feel free to remove it.

I am a graduate student researcher from the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS; **IRB #2023-056-ONLINE**) studying the helpfulness of a **4-week** **online** **mindfulness** treatment for **anxiety, depression, and stress** in younger (18-30) and older adults (50+) for my master's thesis.

Participation will involve completing online surveys and learning and practicing mindfulness exercises introduced in the online intervention program. After completion of the program, participants will be **entered to win a $25 Amazon gift card (raffled)**.

**Approximately 1.5 hours of your time each week is required.**

All in all, through this study, I hope to better illuminate the effects of brief mindfulness programs in both younger and older adults, along with promoting awareness and future research for these types of programs! üòä

In order to participate you must:

* Be **18-30 or 50+** years of age
* Have access to the Internet and email
* Be willing to answer questions about your mood and memory
* **Not** have prior experience with mindfulness/meditation
* **Not** currently be receiving therapy

**If you're interested in participating, please fill out these two screening surveys below:**

**1)** [**First survey**](https://surveyuccs.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7QhVlmDU41IscpU)**; 2)** [**Second survey**](https://surveyuccs.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cvfaWgTFYIVKNds)

\*\*After completion of the surveys, you'll be directed to [**this page**](https://imgur.com/a/Aj8qpzh) that says ""invalid survey\_code"". Simply ignore it as this is for UCCS students only; your response has been recorded!

**If you don't believe you qualify to participate, please feel free to share this information with other people who might be able to participate.**

"There is nothing wrong with caring about other people as long as it's not excessive and not causing you any harm.

In your case, it sounds like it is causing you harm, and that is because you aren't caring for yourself as you should. It is important to change that. Start looking after yourself and your own needs first, then you can start caring about friends and family.

If you have any health issues, seek medical help. If you are feeling lonely, spend some time on your hobbies (like watching a movie, playing video games, reading and exploring nature) and spend time with family and friends.

"Of course you can! You just don't want to and have never tried.

It's uncomfortable doing this, and as you know we naturally seek comfort. There is no other option for you here. Go through the shit that you have caused. Take blame and responsibility for everything in your life, not in a negative way but from a place of repair. 

If you think all the problems in your life are caused by others then you have no power to fix them. Only you CAN fix your life, only you WILL fix your life and ultimately everyone else is the exact same. So naturally no one really cares about you (as bad as it sounds) because everyone is doing their own thing, probably worried about the exact same shit. ""Are they looking at me"" etc. 

The issue isn't that you can't concentrate. That's not what you're trying to do. Let your mind flow freely, let the ""non concentrated"" state happen.

I stayed for longer because I don‚Äôt like ending situations when they feel off vibe which I guess I stupid. The evening continued like that until I went home. Needed 40 minutes for the way home and it was already really late.
I left feeling so drained afterwards. Today I also felt like trash almost the entire time. I guess it is normal not to feel appreciated all the time. Even though I think she really was being weird and egoistic.
But after things like this happen I get so depressed. When this stuff happens I obsessively think about how I could have handled the situation better, what I did wrong and why I wasn‚Äôt treated with respect.

"There's no official test for it, so you have to go the DIY route.  Most people respond well to antihistamines.  I did not, however...I had to go with a supplement enzyme to boost my body's levels.  Night & day difference for me after a lifetime of emotional nonsense!

Note that you can still override the medication by ingesting too much histamine from food!  As far as effects go, ""histamine is a signaling molecule and too much can cause issues in almost every part of the body"".  I had a LOT of minor symptoms growing up:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/ytmcl4/comment/iw75m9l/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/ytmcl4/comment/iw75m9l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

From a high-level perspective:

* Food has histamine in it
* The DAO enzyme in your body lets you digest it & then it goes into your gut
* If you don't make enough enzyme, it does into your bloodstream instead & causes everything to go wonky

If you want to try it, order a pack of NaturDAO from Amazon, take one pill, and wait 24 hours.  If you don't get a reaction, try a high daily dose for 3 days (for me, it takes 72 hours for the gut inflammation to die down) & then see how you feel. My intake procedure is 5 to 10 pills per day (they are tiny & made from beans, FYI).  Schedule-wise:

* Take one in the morning when you wake up
* Take one before bed
* Take one 5 minutes before eating
* Take one anytime you feel weird (malaise, anxiety, etc.)

My full procedure is:

* 5 to 10 pills throughout the day
* A primarily low-histamine diet (still learning what works for my particular body)
* As much hydration as possible
* As much sleep as possible (including naps)
* A low-stress lifestyle (after getting the food aspect under control, I discovered that stress is an even BIGGER trigger for histamine release in my body than food is!)

I never enjoyed emotional stability growing up.  I always just felt negative or apathetic.  Big mood swings.  My self-confidence was entirely energy-based, so when my histamine was high, I automatically just felt terrible about myself!  Strong imposter syndrome. Always felt ""less than"".  Always felt like a second-class citizen.

Anxiety was like a branding iron...it wasn't something I chose or worked myself up to; it simply existed IN me & was constantly poking at me!  I'm a pretty chill person IRL, so this was always confusing to me!  Some additional technical reading:

* [https://mthfrsupport.com.au/2016/09/histamine-and-mental-health/](https://mthfrsupport.com.au/2016/09/histamine-and-mental-health/)

This bit in particular:

>An alternative explanation for the majority of behavioral and psychological symptoms of histamine intolerance, especially anxiety, is that they are generated in the body and not in the brain. This is through the ability of histamine to trigger the release of epinephrine, the major player in the body‚Äôs fight-or-flight response.  
>  
>Epinephrine, like histamine, cannot cross the blood-brain barrier but it can trigger a wide array of panic symptoms like fast heartbeat, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, nausea, and anxiety.

I pretty much lived in low-key 4F Mode (flight/fight/fawn/freeze) all the time growing up.  Some of the more specific histamine-driven experiences included:

* A strong need for external validation, not due to *thinking*, but due to histamine excess. You mentioned you freak out after you leave an experience when people don't appreciate your presence.  Real or imagined validate quells this need, but not through your choice, just automatically!
* It's easy to be a people-please & a pushover when pressed because we feel really bad & feel guilty & want the confrontation to end as quickly as possible because we don't have the emotional energy to stand our ground in the heat of the moment.
* Social situations are *incredibly* draining for us.  It's similar to exercise intolerance (doing the task requires a lot of energy to keep up with paying attention to people) & P.E.M. (post-exertional malaise) where you feel terrible for hours or days after the exertion.  So you go to a concert or a sports game in a stadium or to hang out with someone & just get *wiped out* afterwards!
* Your brain automatically ruminates about things & over-thinks everything & starts analyzing your behavior & starts guilt-tripping you for how you behaved.  The model I use is the ""Scales of Injustice"", where you have balancing plates to measure things.  The left scale is our energy, which gets heavy when it gets low & sinks down, which makes the right scale of our emotions go UP, so we're high-keyed all the time emotionally, which is positively DRAINING to deal with all the time!

This is NOT how we are designed to feel!  We have the capacity to feel 3 ways:

1. Happy for no reason, just sitting there doing nothing
2. Like a motor of energy is inside of us, pushing us along all day long
3. Instantly awake the moment we wake up in the morning, not slogged down & not wanting to get out of bed

Everyone has a different baseline.  Some people are naturally high-energy, while others need to purposely fuel their bodies for high energy, manage their bedtime strictly, etc.

"part 2/2

There's a term I use called the ""warm fuzzy"", which is where emotionally, you shouldn't be worried about the past or anxious about the future.  For me, I felt like I was living in an invisible dimension consisting of a house of mirrors like at the fair.  Like everything was just kind of weird & scary all the time!

If you're up for a longer read, I have my own version of the different energy levels I experience here:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/14jbzqi/comment/jplmw84/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3

I just never felt very good growing up!  Always kinda sick, always kinda tired, always felt weird emotionally.  Very much an introvert, always got drained by social situations, despite liking people.  Definitely check out the r/HSP club & pick up a copy of Elaine Aron's book ""The Highly Sensitive Person"" (Kindle, paper, or audiobook); it read like an autobiography for me!

I suspect a HUGE amount of people, especially anxiety suffers, have histamine as either a root cause or at least a contributing cause.  The information of how it behaves & how to treat it were not readily apparent to me.  I was very fortunate that things lined up last year & I was able to dive more into it, which ended up completely changing my life around!

I've spent decades feeling bad, feeling weird, feeling tired, feeling low-energy, and my whole world was like that house of mirrors where everyone else seemed to just be cruising along happily & I was sitting there overthinking every little thing & experience strange emotions all the time.

I did see an allergist, but even he was like there's not really any tests, you just have to try stuff out.  I tried out half a dozen antihistamines with no luck.  I tried out NaturDAO, initially with no luck, but then went on a high dose & within a few days was ""cured""!  I've been on it daily for 10 months this month...I can't even explain the difference in my quality of life!

I can drive places with zero anxiety.  My Inattentive ADHD still overstimulates me in crowds, but I don't get anxiety from it.  My brain doesn't play the ""Wheel of Misfortune"" intrusive thoughts game.  I don't feel like terrible outcomes are in process & that it's all my fault. I don't feel vaguely guilty all the time anymore.

My lifetime of insomnia is gone. No more bounding pulse at night.  My brain used to conjure up cringy things I did growing up in grade school when I'd try to fall asleep...gone now!  I don't have time pressure anymore, like when you know you have to wake up in the morning but your brain starts stressing out about getting enough sleep to cope with the day so it gets all wired up & keeps you up lol.

So much nonsense, all from a simple DAO deficiency that resulted in excess histamine in my bloodstream.  The diet part does take some work; I'm not perfect at it by any means.  I'd suggest just starting out with a high-dose trial week to see if it helps you or not.

It's been hit & miss with the people I know that I've had try it. For some people...zero results.  For others, as life-changing as my experience.  It's like being low in iron & then taking an iron supplement to feel better...my body is simply low in DAO & I need to constantly supplement through the day to prevent my physical, emotional, and mental energy from going haywire.

I've learned so much about how life really ""is"" vs. how I THOUGHT it was based on my lived experience.  Like how you can go somewhere & hang out with people & then not ruminate afterwards.  Like how you don't have to get fatigue from the dread of just *thinking* about going places & doing things.  It's pretty wild!

"I (20m) have consistently experienced the loss of my female friends, and it has become a recurring pattern. Contrary to the assumption that they might feel uncomfortable around me, that is not the case. Initially, these friends were incredibly comfortable around me, and we shared a genuine care for each other. I maintained a respectful boundary by never flirting or entertaining sexual thoughts about them. However, at a certain point, their behavior towards me abruptly changed without any apparent reason.
When I attempted to address the issue with them, nearly all of them responded by gaslighting me, making me question whether I was overthinking and overreacting. Yet, it was evident that I wasn't. It's noteworthy that these female friends had minimal connections with one another, most of them only knowing each other through me. This recurring pattern baffles me.
Am I overlooking something crucial here? While I have grown less affected by these losses, especially since losing my last female friend who held great significance to me since childhood, my question still remains unanswered. Why does this consistently occur? It's worth mentioning that my friendships with males continue without issue, but my relationships with females have consistently faltered throughout my life, including my previous and only romantic relationship where I was betrayed at the age of 18.
I don't intend to speak ill of girls in any way, but the fact remains that my connections with females have been troublesome. Can someone shed light on this perplexing situation?"	M0nK-420	post	28.14129513287715	female	White	0.9984172582626343	na	na	na	2	selfhelp
"I‚Äôll be honest with you here, 
sometimes there isn‚Äôt a logical reason. 

For years I‚Äôve watched my female friends bond with men, become very close even, and then one day a switch simply flips and they check out mentally for seemingly no reason at all. When girls befriend guys and it‚Äôs purely platonic the chances that she will simply lose interest in the friendship later on is very high, it happens with girl/girl relationships as well. One day you‚Äôre tight and the next they are 100% dismissive. It can be extremely distressing and confusing when there is no reason, and I wish I could explain it better, not please know that this more than likely isn‚Äôt your fault and you did nothing to spark it. It‚Äôs just a hurtful thing that happens. I‚Äôve lost all of my female friends because of this exact switch up and I am female.  

The best advice I can give you is to leave what wants to be left alone. If they are treating you as less than or are constantly hot and cold with you don‚Äôt give them your time and attention. Don‚Äôt take any sort of social or personal disrespect, you deserve better friends.

Hmm what is it you feel jealous of exactly? The emotions people are experiencing? Or the friendship and companionship of close friends? Find something that you are passionate about. Have you tried rock climbing? There are tons of rock climbing gyms now. Nothing feels better than an adrenaline spike from extreme sports! Plus you naturally make friends who are also interested when you join stuff like that! Have you tried kayaking or white water rafting? Check to see if your school offers any extracurriculars that sound interesting to you. You should at least try a few things before you figure out what you really enjoy doing! You're at that age unfortunately where you're too young to drive yet too old to be treated like a little kid. It's a difficult age to be at! I felt the same way when I was going from middle school to highschool and I spent the whole summer kayaking and running and really focused on improving myself and I was a totally different person by the time school started in the fall. You need goals, a project, something you are passionate about, to put your time into. I would also see if you can shadow a bunch of different jobs just to see what it's like if you don't know what you want to do after highschool yet. Like ride along with a detective, or shadow a baker, or a financial advisor or an engineer, a doctor, or a museum curator, or a veterinarian!

I think being able to articulate how you feel, especially at your age - but at any age really,  is a step in the right direction. Can you talk to your family about it? Can you ask your parents to get you a therapist? I think there's probably some underlying stuff there and a therapist can help you sort it out. Even if there's nothing underneath, therapy can help you figure out what you should do to help yourself. Sometimes it's our biology that affects how we are thinking. If that's the case, meds might help, but I recommend a therapist to help you figure it if that's what it is. I'm sorry you're feeling this way and I hope you find a way to feel better soon.

"I have realised over a span of these 3-4 weeks, that spiritual growth, like the growth of every other aspect in life, be it ‚Äî professional, physical, emotional, too requires constant work, effort, a lot of motivation, every day, every minute of the day.

&#x200B;

Because when I couldn‚Äôt look after my inner growth for these few weeks due to my physical illnesses one after the other, my compulsions were again setting in. My mind was again trying to go to its past programming ‚Äî those past useless stories I used to spend my entire day thinking upon.

&#x200B;

That anger, frustration, blame games that my mind had kind of perfected in, were again trying to seep in through those little holes that meditation had now started to fill in. I realised I was afraid of this. Since I didn‚Äôt want to return back to the kind of person I was. 

&#x200B;

I liked this ME. I was liking the new freedom I had found, the NEW JOY that was filling me from within.

&#x200B;

I realised we need not be perfect, but what matters the most is if we are trying to be one step better than what we were. Even if the physical circumstances do not allow us right now, be it an ailment or even some family commitment, but the inner longing to be that one step better ‚Äî even that helps‚Ä¶. always!

This quote bySadguru summarises all this so beautifully. :)

There is no need to be perfect, but are you a constant striving to be better. That is all that matters.

"I am a loser. I'm 23 years old, just graduated, looking for a job, don't have a lot of friends, and have never kissed or even held a girl's hand.

I graduated from high school over five years ago yet I obsess over people who probably never think about me. I had no friends in high school and I wish I could have a second chance, prove people wrong. I thought things would be different when I transferred to my dream school but they weren't. I ended up transferring.

I've lived in several different cities and I've never had a lot of friends and certainly not a GF. I've spent the entirety of the past two days looking up people I went to HS with and they ALL have way more friends and more fun in life than me. Don't give me this BS about ""social media is cherrypicked/just a highlight reel"" bc those moments are things I've NEVER done or had. I'm the common denominator in every situation I've been in and have always sucked.

Since graduating, I turned down two job offers but now I don't get any interest for the jobs I actually want even though I've been applying for like a dozen jobs per day. Personal life sucks. Professional life sucks.

I try to be nice, I'm tall, I'm a good looking guy, I exercise 4-6 times a week. For what? Nothing I hate more than the fact that I NEVER get any attention from women. I looked up some women I had huge crushes on and LOST IT when I saw how beautiful they are. Here I am obsessing over them when I'll never see them again. 

I'm 23 years old. Blah blah blah blah blah I'm still young and have tons of years remaining. People 3,4,5,6,7 years younger than me have gotten luckier and done more than me with way less time."	Shortswinterwearer	post	41.18921823874606	female	White	0.9991889595985413	na	na	na	11	selfhelp
You‚Äôre gonna hate this answer but it‚Äôs definitely your attitude towards life and yourself right now. I think it‚Äôll be worth your time spending it on researching a good therapist and seeing what you can do about that. It sounds cliche, but the hard work comes from within.

" Mate, your viewpoint of the world sucks. Your mentality sucks. Your outlook sucks.  
If you have already decided that you are a loser. Now, reverse the role and put yourself in other peoples perspective (those you wanted as prospective friends, girlfriend, employers) . Would you want to have anything to do with them?  
When you change your sucking ways.. Something tells that many things will start to suck less for you. You past is not the determinant of your future. You mindset and how you interpret and act on those past is.  
I recently ran into 2 young people 16 and 18 that gave me similar sod story. I gave them a simple tasks of approaching 2 random strangers (old, young, men and women) a day, complement them and wish them a nice day for 3 days, as pre-requisite for me offering to help them through my work as a coach. Only 3 days, you want know how long they lasted after all the initial excitement ran out?! 20 hours. And they mostly just approach young girls their own age and ask for their instagram after (which is again what I ask, just give value and walk away). So, they were only thinking about themselves still. Then followed it with excuses why they couldn't stay reliable and consistent just for 3 days.  
You said ""I try to be nice."" Well, that is your biggest problem. You are trying to pretend to be something you are not, ""NICE"". Work on yourself to become an authentically kind person that care about anything else than just your own sucky self.

"Like the title said, I grew up in a toxic household. Screaming and yelling was the norm. I have an amazing fianc√© and I can‚Äôt keep reacting and escalating fights. He is a saint and I‚Äôm at the point where I can finally acknowlege I need to make some serious changes. Not only for my fianc√©, but for my future family. Every fight becomes either highly emotional or me feeling like I‚Äôm losing something. I struggle with not feeling heard, and it immediately puts me in fight mode to protect something I‚Äôm not sure I even need to react. After the fights I feel awful and typically come to my senses. 

Anyways, long story short, I want to make some changes. Does anybody have any impactful books they could recommend? Has anybody went through something similar and gotten better? Down the line I want to get some therapy, because I clearly have some issues I need to work through, but at the time money isn‚Äôt amazing and I live in an extremely high cost of living area. Going to look and see if I can find anybody in my insurance, although it was a nightmare last time, I‚Äôm hoping things have changed.

"I‚Äôve been dating this guy on and off for about 8 years now. More so on then off. Anytime we ever break up is because I usually have had enough of her verbal abuse. He calls me names , talks poorly about my choices , my life , my family , my friends , my parenting. He just really talks badly about anything about me. I‚Äôm 100% aware he‚Äôs abusive but I tend to always find my fault in why he get so easily angered. I realize that I‚Äôm not the perfect person an I take a-lot of accountability for the messed up things that I do so sometimes I don‚Äôt blame him.  

However , we both have kids and recently he said some really hurtful verbally abusive stuff to my 8 year old daughter. He told her ‚ÄúF off I never liked you anyways‚Äù. She‚Äôs been struggling for years telling me she feels like he doesn‚Äôt like her because he is incredibly hard on both her and his child. He is overly strict and is on their case all the time. He complains that I‚Äôm too soft on them so he‚Äôs extra hard of them. But in the same breath says he doesn‚Äôt want to discipline them at all because he‚Äôs tired of being the bad guy. He feels like the discipline is not equally yoked between us. But I don‚Äôt feel like anything is equal between us. I pay for most of the things in the house hold (rightfully so it‚Äôs my home) but he does spend a lot of time here and rarely contributes , he does help with house work and anytime I need something he gets it done but I handle Most of the work and all the bills. He just says ‚Äúit‚Äôs your house and I didn‚Äôt ask to live here ‚Äú. We actually never even had a convo about him living here he just stays and comes and goes as he pleases. 

To make matters a worse none of my family or friends like him. So I constantly have to pick between them or him. I can‚Äôt have gatherings at my house with both of em both sides refuse which puts me in such an awkward space because when he‚Äôs here I‚Äôm glued to him and my family and friends get mad but when he‚Äôs gone family or friends will come around and he feels isolated and he gets mad. It‚Äôs a constant battle and it‚Äôs been like this for 8 YEARS ! 

Honestly , I don‚Äôt know what to do because I know that I‚Äôve contributed to all this madness but he‚Äôs really making me hate my life and hate myself because all the awful things he says to me or about me make me feel bad about myself and I beleive a lot of what he says is true even though everyone else says it‚Äôs not.

"I'm gonna be harsh. Do you care about your kid at all? Like even a little? Cuz you know that every second you let her spend around this piece of dogshit is hurting her and almost certainly causing her lasting emotional damage. And let's reframe here a little bit: you're choosing your POS bf over letting your daughter spend more time with her family because your family can't stand your toxic bf. Sure, sucks for you that you can't have family over because you choose your bf over them, sucks more for your child cuz she can't choose and is suffering the consequences of your actions. Or inaction. Stop being a spineless, selfish wimp and be the strong woman and mother your 8 year old daughter needs to see. You are TEACHING her that she should put up with this bullshit from boys and men in her life. And your BF is teaching her that she deserves men like him.

Now that was all about your daughter, and I could write more about her, and as much about you. Please stand up, and show your daughter how to value herself, stand up for herself and deal with ""men"" like this. And show her she's worth fighting for by getting her the fuck out of this situation

Edit: Nevermind, i will talk some about you. You said that you contribute to the madness and acknowledge that you have imperfections that he picks on. So what? Just because you have flaws that he exploits to hurt you doesn't mean you deserve it, or that he's right to exploit them and pick on you for them. It's the difference between constructive criticism and bullying. Another thing your daughter is gonna learn btw, that her flaws make her deserve being hurt and bullied.

"So  my birthday is coming up this weekend, and I am still on the verge of  deciding whether I want to hold a birthday dinner/ or karaoke night with  some friends. I've been an introvert my whole life and i barely  socialize. I waste my time in my room crying or rotting away in my bed.  How do i have friends you may ask? I know around 4 people in my life  that I consider good friends and even though I don't have a lot of  friends these four people have made me happy and helped improve my life.  The only thing is, I met them all from different places and no one  knows each other yet haha. Deep down I want to hold a dinner so we could  all meet up, meet each other and enjoy a meal for my birthday. I am  worried because I'm nervous it would be overwhelming for some of my  friends or it might be awkward.

Another  thing is, I've been struggling a lot  with my mental health lately and I  have been feeling like I need to look and be in a good space to hang  out with people. I  have been struggling with binge eating and gaining  so much weight it makes me feel gross to be seen. A part of me wants to  be alone and sulk in my comfy bed for my birthday but I hate that I'm  also wasting the opportunity. At this very moment I feel so depressed  and want to be alone, but i know  i will regret it eventually. I know  I'm young and I just want to look back at this time and know at least i  did something with some friends.

I'm  just so worried and in this dilemmna don't know how to approach it.  should i still hold the celebration? Would it be too last minute? would  they even show up? I know that many of my thoughts might be silly or  dramatic but I don't have much experience with friends. Any words of  advice would really help."

"I (20F) am currently going through a self-improvement arc and I am researching and educating my actions better. I realise that I need to be more disciplined and one of the reasons I am not disciplined is because I will not do it if I'm doing the activity alone. But the moment I am with somebody, I perform the activity well. What could this possibly mean? I don't get why I can only do things when I'm with somebody but not when I'm alone. Is it because with myself, there is no accountability being held? If you think so, how do you think I can approach this issue?

"Hi,

You could do small activities for the purpose of discipline by yourself in your home/room - the basic ones are making your bed (ik a classic), keeping your room clean, reading, and basically anything that you don't already do that you think you ""should.""

The goal is for those things to build momentum and self-sufficiency /confidence to do things by yourself.

A big thing is to analyze why you want to do things with others, or why you don't do things by yourself. Is it because you're scared of people seeing you by yourself or you don't know what to do, or for other reasons? The best ways to address this are journaling or asking people around you for their thoughts. 

Based on what you said, it seems like you need/want someone with you because they motivate you. If that's the case, finding your own motivation is the most important thing you could to to unlock your issue with starting.

You could get someone to do something with you the first time, and see if that helps. 

But, what it comes down to is how much you want \[it\] and what you're willing to do to get \[it\]

For example, I wanted to lose weight for years, but what pushed me to actually do it was a beach trip with people I wanted to look ""good"" for. 

You have to find that \[thing\] that flips the switch/motivates you/your reason why. Either that, or you follow the traditional bro advice of ""fuck your feelings"" and just do it."	woedgravitationaloul	reply	na	na	na	0.0022654556669294834	weak	no	no	na	selfhelp
I'm an unemployed 28F who can't drive with no friends. I really want to see a psychiatrist because for the past month I've been really depressed that I am a bad person with no empathy and I'm worry I'm narcissistic. All day long, I argue with myself whether I am selfish narcissist or a hard done by depressed person, so I'm either feeling scared of myself or sorry for myself all day and I'm getting sick of it. I really want to see a psychiatrist for a diagnosis so I don't have to worry what is wrong with me anymore and get therapy but I have no money and feel like i'm drowning in debt. I can see a psychiatrist for free if I am referred by my family doctor but he is two hours from where I live and I have no way of getting there. I feel too scared and depressed to get my drivers licence and I live in a small town where the only jobs are at a coffee shop where I already failed my interview.

"It's good to be selfish sometimes, for example when it comes to doing something for only yourself that will benefit you in the long run. My depression came from having a large sense of loneliness just like you and it took me three years to get out of that state but I overcame that by working on relationships with people I already have in my life and seeing goals for myself which helped me ignore my troubles and brought me success, that success made me happier and I met people along the way with the same goals and aspersions that I became friends with. My advice for you is to set goals for yourself, join groups on discord or anywhere else where people have similar goals as you, don't focus on the end result because it might be something completely different which sets you back and you'll end up being disappointed instead of happy about the progress you have made leading up to that moment, build meaningful relationships (they take time so don't rush them), lastly ,don't place yourself above others (everytime you think that you're better than that McDonald's worker, place yourself in their shoes or better yet watch videos of how poorly these people are treated by those who have a God complex and see that regarding yourself as more important than others is destructive)

"Setting boundaries is a crucial aspect of personal growth and self-care. It helps establish healthy relationships, protects your well-being, and allows you to focus on your own goals. Take time to reflect on your values, priorities, and what matters most to you. Understand your own needs, limits, and what you're comfortable with in different situations. This self-awareness is the foundation for setting effective boundaries.

It seems like you know well what you aren't good at. What are you good at?   


The one thing I hate that people tell me when I help others is that my advice is too harsh. When I speak to someone, I assume you are confident. Perhaps you aren't mentally ready for some of the advice only in the way that it won't register completely. That doesn't mean the advice is useless. It may apply later on your journey.   


Playing the victim obviously doesn't get you anywhere, but one thing that is perpetuated by society (I rarely say that) is that everyone assumes that people with depression are weak. Weak mentally, weak in whatever aspect. I argue they are among the strongest.  


Just understand that you're exactly where you're supposed to be. You never realise a mistake is a mistake until after you made it. The knowledge you had last week was not the knowledge you have this week.   


You mentioned ""I feel like I'm never going to go anywhere in life"". According to who. Where is it you want to go? I'm sure you hear a lot of things online that you already know, and hearing them again or told a different way may make you understand or help you apply it to your life.   


The best part of this entire experience is that you have the choice of what information you get to keep, use, apply and leave behind. People rarely ever go back to change information that they applied previously. When you were 16 you didn't know what you know now, why judge that version of you?  


I apologise if this is long. If you feel a little lost in your journey, remember there are always people out there who will help you. The way you feel has led you here looking for answers. What exactly are you looking for? Perhaps you just want someone to talk to (Which is needed and completely fine). With these skills you're trying to achieve, what benefit are you trying to reap? You know logically impressing someone with a skill isn't going to give you long term satisfaction. But subconsciouly perhaps that's what your drive was. Then achieving the skill was never genuine in the first place.   


Clue up on some of these ideas you have and the goals you have. Importantly you need a plan on how to achieve these things.

"First of all you're 18. You have your entire life ahead of you. I'm 21, I used to feel similar to you but to get to where I am now it took time(5 or so years). What helped me over time was that where you are now is perfect, where you are later in life is perfect.   


To be in an improved state, one where you feel you are achieving meaningful things in life you need to experience what you are experiencing now.   


You haven't seen enough of life to understand how things really are, even me saying that I have so much more to experience. Most people are losers, like practically everyone. Just because 1 person did something doesn't mean everyone else did, but they're probably still a loser.   


My point is who cares. You're a loser in everyone elses eyes just as much as I am. Let go of all these contraints you have set on yourself. Just keep going, never stop, never quit. Only people who quit lose.   


As far as being another average forgotten joe, whats wrong with that? Why judge the common man of society of which you are currently? We're all in the same boat here. In reality no one actually knows what the fuck is happening. It's all super funny, everyone acts tough, like they know everything.

"As the title says, I \[39m\] am about to at least start looking for counselling \[again\] for this. I tick most of the boxes every time you type 'self destructive habits' in your preferred search engine. The main ones being porn consumption \[i'm married\], binge eating \[like 3k cals a day of chocolate - im 'only' 30lbs over weight but do 40 mins daily of cardio to maintain that\], alcohol \[i don't  'need it' every day but as a relaxant i have no off switch and if i am responsible to no one, such as on business trips, I will literally go to  a bar until 4am, i've had a lot of dangerous incidents on alcohol - ambulanes, broken bones, police\], massive procrastination, particularly at work, i get enough done, likely to get me to meet expectations - but I work in a high performing, well paid environment, I put myself down a lot and always need 'food' or 'distraction'.

I am sorry this feels like ranting, I've had 3 glasses of wine to go into whatever escapism mode I am chasing. I've read a lot about shame / pride and tbh it clicks, but as someone with a lot of, what feels like, very long held insecurities, I honestly don't know what else to do / where else to turn.

"I'm surprised this has no comments. Whatever this is not saying people farm for karma but if this comment and your story lights up someone then it's all worth it. If it doesn't ever reach anyone then whatever.  


Firstly why are you trying to ""beat"" yourself? You're probably playing scenarios both that may happen to you and ones that have happened to you right? If you believe you are being judged, what part of you are you afraid of being judged? The porn part? The food part?   


It's difficult when you speak to someone for 90minutes about deep things only for that to happen. Do you have any friends you can open up to? I am not of similar experience age wise to know what it's like making friends when you're 39. I'm assuming nothing is different, people are probably more reserved but the issue lies in what you believe. If you believe finding new friends to talk to is hard, then going out and finding friends is filtered through that idea.  


This is where sabotage comes from. In order to reinforce that idea you need to live up to that ""Friends are hard to find"" otherwise you're wrong! I can't ever be wrong oh no!!!   


Your solution is to stop running even for 10 minutes a day as it will take time. Look at your problems in the face. Are you overweight? What do you think of that? Why do you think that? What will happen? Go down the trail of whys.   


E.G. I am fat. People will judge me because of that. Why? because people don't like fat people Why do I need to be liked? To make me feel better. Why do I need to feel better? So I am happy. Why do I need to be happy? So life is good. Why does life have to be good? etc.   


It can go any way. You must be completely honest with yourself. These are more often than not accompanied by experiences. Like above example when you were laughed at in highschool for being fat or whatever. Why are you holding onto that idea?   


Going through it all is THE ONLY way to let go of it all. Speak to your wife about it. Tell her exactly how you feel. Go through it alone as well. I love being alone. If not why not?  


Some good questions to bring up things are -

Why do I hate myself? (You likely don't but what answers might come up there? Go through why that might have come up, think of experiences linked. Go through it completely, let it go)  
Why am I not good enough?  
Why do I even try at all? (This is for the opposite effect, be honest. Bring up the things that motivate you. Often it is family, supporting friends, wife, kids etc.)  


You make the experience here. No one else does. Just because someone else does one thing doesn't mean you have to at all. It all starts with willing to accept information in the first place. If you sit down and deny all of this, obviously nothing will change. Go through it, ask yourself what of this applies to me. Try some of it, doesn't work, try something else.

"

I'm 25M, an Indian, fair, skinny, if all these details can be any relevant.

Since childhood, I've noticed that people takes me for granted. Let me explain few cases:

- My schooling happened in hostel where my hostelmates molested me as we used to sleep together (many instances)
- Few months back, one of my good classmates from school asked me for my CTC, I told him some random number less than my actual CTC, and asked him not to tell this to anybody, but later in a school reunion I got to know that everyone from my schoolmates knew my salary, I didn't confronted that friend as I never talked to him after that get together.
- Few months back, I went to a trip and explicitly asked my mom to not tell any relatives about my trip but she ended up telling to so many relatives and that pisses me off
- I occasionally visit a local food vendor, kind of their regular customer, I've been noticing for few times that he takes time to serve me food, like even when those who come after me, he serves them and then me.

All these instances made me adamant to not believe anybody, and I'm having trust issues.

I think there's something wrong in my personality, that I'm not aware of, that makes people take me for granted as if I can't do any shit, my words have no respect or what!?

Is it related to my body or personality?

It won't change anything, it won't make people suddenly love and respect me, it won't magically change their minds.

"Reframe what being triggered is.   


Getting triggered is something inside of you saying ""what the fuck, I don't agree with that!"".   


When I feel triggered (I have broadened my definition to everything that changes the way I feel quickly) I ask myself why I'm feeling that way. Was it something someone said?  


Let's say for example it was something someone said. Why did that trigger me? What inside me disagrees with that? And then follow the trail of whys. Why does it make me feel that way? Because I am afraid I will be wrong. Why am I afraid of being wrong? Others will judge me. Why is being judged bad?   


The questions you ask can change depending on what answer you are looking for. You can ask why, you can ask what (What happens if people judge me) etc. Whatever you want really as long as you answer honestly to yourself.   


In order to do that, you must remove judgement from yourself. All the things you did in the past you did because you didn't know otherwise. Mistakes are only mistakes until after you make them, you didn't know before. So forgive your past self, take responsibility and thank your past self for delivering you here right now.

The way you think of that experience is ultimately what influences you. You know that.

You sit where you are now and judge that past self. Saying things like, ""How could I have made that mistake"". You didn't know better then? Mistakes are only mistakes after they've been made.

A good start would be to explore: a. what is good for me in staying where I am right now & what am I going to lose in achieving my goal. Let me know if you have any other questions.

"Intrinsic motivation versus extrinsic as someone already said.

And biggest for me: make the things more enjoyable. If you hate every second of something you‚Äôre not gonna last long. Have positive thoughts while doing something and create a nice atmosphere. Music can do wonders.

Once things have become routine to you (after 30 to 180 days I think?) they take a lot less energy to do and you will be doing them on autopilot.

It‚Äôs been about three weeks since I moved into my new apartment, and all of a sudden I‚Äôve been having some problems. This was my first permanent move out of my parents house after college, and I feel like the ‚Äúnovelty‚Äù stage of moving is finally over now that I‚Äôve set everything up. I‚Äôm having trouble comprehending the move. I don‚Äôt really miss home, I‚Äôm just struggling to accept the fact that I‚Äôm living somewhere other than home for the first time in my life. It‚Äôs been very disorienting, and I‚Äôve found myself panicking on the toilet, or suddenly feeling out of place like I‚Äôm somewhere totally unfamiliar, despite having surrounded myself with deco and furniture I‚Äôm familiar with. This issue especially manifests itself at night, because I start to feel scared and uncomfortable in bed. It feels like when I was a kid and couldn‚Äôt sleep at night because I was scared of monsters, or the dark. Ive tried breathing techniques or other CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) techniques to calm myself down, but haven‚Äôt found a solution yet. I know it might sound childish, and I certainly feel that way. I just want to know if this is a me problem, or if anyone else has had problems adjusting to a new place like I am.

It can take awhile to adjust to a new environment and develop a new routine. I had some challenges adapting to this place I am living in now. It is a lot smaller than what I am used to and a lot of my things had to be stored at my parents place. I also do not have the freedom to get up and go like I did when I lived in the city. Plus it did not help I had additional challenges to overcome when I moved (e.g., financial, sickness, winter was coming, death in the family). What helped me to adjust to a new place was to focus on some of the positive things about where I am at. I am a one minute walk to some beautiful walking trails, I have a yard now (started a garden this spring), and I got to live a slower pace of life again. My wife and I created some new traditions together as well. One thing I started was making Monday a day where I take some time to do a hobby I used to enjoy. I have also made some new friends and work and they are coming over for a party. Finding some ways to make your life interesting and bring some people to your place. Make some awesome memories!

"There is no problem. This is a normal thing. 

You already identified the problem ""I know it might sound childish"". Stop judging yourself.

Reframe the way you're thinking. You just moved out! Congratulations, freedom is finally yours. You worked hard and deserve it. There are likely deeper rooted issue that need to be dealt with especially for the reason you think you're being a child.

Perhaps you still judge that younger version of you for being scared of the dark. Let go of that, and in order to do that you must ask yourself, why. Why do I judge this younger version of me. Why do I hate that version of me. Things will come up, I'm not sure what (perhaps, ""because that version of me wasn't good enough""). In that example, why was that version not good enough for me? Can I let go and accept that version of me?

If you focus all your energy on trying to fight some part of you and never allow yourself to be wrong sometimes you'll never feel whole. Accept all of you. You are good enough. After all, your past got you where you are right now. And where you are now will get you to where you are tomorrow. 

Things change all the time and quickly, but it always occurs, NOW. You read this now. Tomorrow you will work now. When you become aware and present, now is the only thing occuring.

"That's great you are seeking therapy, however I say this because I think everybody deserves to have a great therapist whom they trust and can confide in. Having and speaking regularly to a nonjudgmental confidante who you trust and respect and consider to be wiser than yourself is a very wise thing to do! Personally, I would suggest a Jungian or other psychoanalytic talk therapist, not a mainstream psychiatric talk therapist. Psychoanalysis is an approach that assumes life is meaningful and that we can figure life's problems out.

The secret to being interested in oneself, and being happy alone, is to discover your passions, and pursue them. What art-work do you feel it is your purpose in life to do, or that you feel deeply drawn to, or that you feel would be your true calling if only you had the time and money? What activities do you end up doing all the time because you love doing them, that you might not be consciously identifying as your passion or calling already? Everyone has at least one passion like this, usually more than one, and more can be discovered or invented.

Another equally workable secret is to love your potential, to love who you could become. Loving exactly who you are right now too much is not really that great, it can lead us to thinking we are already perfect. It's much cooler and more deeply generative to love the greater person who we could become, if we followed our dreams. That greater person who has actualized their passions and dreams/visions could actually be you, if you began to believe in that person now and because of that tiny grain of belief took the first step to actualize that dream/vision/passion. But not to cling to a specific vision but rather whatever greater potential you end up having in the end--maybe it won't be what you expect.

The third important thing is that you can't just do all this self-exploration in an anxious way like checking off a to-do list. It doesn't sound like you are doing this but it's an easy trap to fall into. If you want to do something for self-improvement that is definitely beneficial and challenging and that is like checking off a task, meditate every day for 20 minutes :). Meditation is just sitting still and gently focusing on your breath, and if you notice your mind has wandered (normal!) gently return your attention to your breath. Meditation is Step 1 in producing more space and time for ""you"" / who you are to show up for yourself. The point of meditation is to develop familiarity with ourselves, our thoughts and feelings, by sitting with them and giving time to that observation process."	garfoso	reply	na	na	na	0.9857337474822998	weak	no	no	na	selfhelp

"I think that im boring or bore others or have nothing interesting to say i ask to many questions and the conversations are like interviews and i don't know how to show my true personality or how to make friends

maybe im desperate and needy and i chase peoples approval/attention 

i don't know how to make others talk, im not that funny or cool or that interesting. maybe im being too harsh on my self..

i just don't know how some people can talk to each other for so long and not run out of stuff to say or talk about

its always me talking more, sending more messages, i always send long messages and still have nothing to say, maybe im doing this to get others to reply so i won't feel bad about myself or get ignored?

mostly its like this
me ""How is it going?"" 
her ""Good, wbu"" 
me""pretty good"" 
her""Good""
me"" what are your hobbies"" 
her""names them"" 
me""that's cool"" 

or i ask ""how is it going "" or ""what makes you happy "" or ""what do you love about yourself "" or i ask ""where you from"" or ""wassup"" or ""who's your favorite artist"" and they name it and i have nothing to say afterwards

maybe because im so bad at conversations i no longer like to even have them, maybe that's why im so quiet most of the time.

like i suck at conversations.. maybe i need to work my self and not worry about making friends right now.

this is awful i know. my conversations are always dry as fuck, maybe i need to have fun in conversations so people actually want to talk to me? i just don't know how. 

i feel like no one likes me or cares about me or loves me, its always me messaging first, its always me asking questions, its always me chasing, and im tired of it

at the same time i dont want to be alone forever. 

i know i have to work on my self and i know i need to stop basing my self worth and whole personality on how others react

i mostly dont even know what to talk about, or what i should say or what to even say.

i used to just try to sext with every girl because dating isn't allowed in where i live, but i don't try to do this anymore, i have no idea what to talk about

im tired of people pleasing, chasing approval, chasing attention, not knowing what to say,  being addicted to porn, posting here for endless of times, basing my self worth on how others react..

It may also help to be around people who you share interests with as the conversation will not be one-sided and you won't have to pretend you're interested.

"1. you probably have some form of anxiety or depression, so consider talking to a doctor if that is an option. the ideal outcome for meds is that you take them just long enough to get out of your funk and build healthy habits

2. the key to becoming great friends with someone is just being legitimately interested in them and their life. i cannot recommend the book ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" enough. fortunately it's a very old book, so you can [find it for free online](https://ia801004.us.archive.org/1/items/HowToWinFriendsAndInfluencePeopleBy/How%20to%20Win%20Friends%20and%20Influence%20People%20by.pdf)

3. practice making eye contact and starting up conversations with everyone you meet, even if it's just smiling and saying ""hi"" before they awkwardly shuffle off. eventually you'll feel much, much more comfortable with it

4. you probably have developed a lifestyle that is isolating. you'll have to find a way to change that, if that's the case. it may be challenging to power through any anxiety that wants you to stay home, but the meds can shortcut that.

5. often these ""no one is interested in me"" situations happen because you're aiming for people who don't find you nearly as attractive as you find them. your options are A) get more attractive, or B) adjust your expectations

we often think that we're saying something wrong, or that there's some technique we don't know that other people have naturally figured out. that's bullshit. if a woman is attracted to you, the amount of technique you need is approximately zero -- just like how if you're attracted to a woman, the amount of technique *she* needs to win your interest is approximately zero.

so get more attractive! exercise more, improve your hygiene and style, do better in your work/school, and find ways to spend more time with people (and take better profile pics if you're doing the online dating thing). it's all within the realm of the possibility. the absolute worst thing you can do is sit around and sulk in self-pity"	Butcher__1	reply	na	na	na	0.9993612170219421	no	no	no	na	selfhelp

"I genuinely need advice on this. Please try not being vague :)

Hey y'all! I'm a 20 year old who is struggling to get stuff together in life. I've never touched alcohol, never smoked, never consumed anything psychedelic, never cheated on or betrayed anyone yet take a lot of shit from almost everyone these days. I had a lot of friends in my life as a teen but when I looked back just days before 20, I realized that I was mostly used as an alternate go-to when my friends' 'important people' didn't give a shit about them. I moved to the United States when I was 18 and most of em started ignoring me already... Like within 15 days. I felt really really bad especially when a really dear friend (she and I were friends since we were in the 9th grade) started ignoring me and texted me only when all her college friends were busy. She didn't check on me for months and that wasn't normal for us. I tried to be that understanding-dude and at a point believed she was genuinely busy, only to see her chilling out in the bar with her new friends. Not just her but many decided to loosen the ties with me. Been a year and a half now and I'm not that emotional anymore. I left Instagram and no one bothered to ask what I was going through. I cut ties with everyone because I knew no one really wanted me around ( I ain't asking for any attention, all I needed was a small talk of 5 minutes a week just to catch up!) And that got me a LOT OF HATE. People called be a betrayer and played victim. I was surprised by this but I don't care anymore. How do I get mentally strong?
I'm sick of being in the influenced world. I started realizing that all my ideologies so far were forcefully shoved into my head as a kid and they're usually what the general media spread. I REALLY WANT TO GET BACK AND START A NEW CHAPTER IN MY 20s. I try extremely hard but can't focus on anything at all. I feel really depressed a lot of times and don't feel like doing anything. Despite that I pull myself out and do what is necessary. But when I do stuff, due to the strong repulsion from my mind I ain't able to do it with complete efficiency. I believe I, and everyone who's born as a human being, has a role in the world and luckily ig I found my purpose of life. But even that doesn't motivate me to do stuff and my mind gets extremely wild when I try to impose discipline on it. PLEASE guide me on this!

A couple of things I want to say. Friendship circles and cycles change a lot when you are an adult. The connections you have with people will wax and wane like the moon cycles. This is a great time to meet new people and expand your horizons. There are people who are not 'call me in the middle of the night when you need me' friends- that is okay. These are built over time. I typically mirror the friendship I am offered for the most part. If someone makes last minute plans with me I only accept if I have nothing better to do. I do not go above and beyond or change my plans. As far as deepening friendships goes it takes time. I like that you are wanting to make genuine connections with people. I think a good place is to first expand your social circles and determine who you might like to get to know more. You have this fresh new start before you as you say and I think it is wonderful you are highly motivated to build strong relationships with people.

"Hi, I'm 20 F. I've always struggled with assessing and dealing with my own emotions, but I'm really good at empathising and helping people out. I'm not diagnosed with depression or anxiety because I didn't get the opportunity to get checked. But I've had suicidal thoughts and even attempted in the past, it was really hard for me, pretending that everything is ok, I'm like a tight shut bottle ready to explode at any moment, with all these negativities and self loathing. 

I've tried controlling things I couldn't because I have no control over my life since childhood.I became manipulative so I'd receive attention that I do not deserve, begged for validation. I've noticed a pattern of people cutting me off for the same reasons, It's about me being dramatic and negative at all times. My friends were so scared of my reactions to their problems so they never open up to me, I was too harsh and I want them to listen to me. My kindness was also taken advantage of that took a toll on my mental health, because I can't deal with people leaving me.

I felt like shit in one situationship I was in, every single day when the person is away, we were talking for awhile yet he doesn't want to put a label on it, so it made me overthink, that he'd leave me and was just feeling guilty talking to me, I was so selfish, putting my feelings first before him, I struggled so much trying to understand him. It was so hard dealing with my mental health and his. I felt bad when he told me he's uncomfortable and shouldn't be pushing my emotions down his throat. 

I love him, and just want the best for him, but I never acted like a friend that he needed at that moment, I just like the idea of being in a relationship with him. I don't ever want that to happen again, I don't want to make the people I value and care about feel that way. 

After so much panic attacks and uneasy feeling everyday, I've had enough. I don't want to feel that way anymore, I want things to change, I was so mad for not doing anything and just drowning underwater when I can literally float and breathe, Go along with the flow and face adversity with courage. 

Self help books, Podcast, taking walks, and journaling are the tools I used. 

I learned to practice self love, setting realistic goals and enjoying the journey not just the destination, Everything takes time, and every little progress matters, I've brought up and apologized for the things that I should hold myself accountable for, My friends started opening up and being more comfortable with me, Practice gratitude, Happiness can not be just found from other people, it should start with ourselves and the things we enjoy. Even just eating your comfort food is happiness, every little things matter. 

My journey made me have so much realizations, and helped me manage my emotions better, I'm still learning and growing everyday. Don't thrive for perfection, we're all still humans we make mistakes and hurt people but we learn and reflect. Don't ever take your past negative experiences as setbacks but take them as a lesson, you can never go back and change them no matter what, acceptance is the key to carry on. You can't control the people around you and the circumstances, what you can control is your reaction and how you respond towards it.

Love yourself, practice gratitude, Find the best tool to help you support yourself, At the end of the day we're all alone with our thoughts, so learn to be your own bestfriend, You'll never be scared being trapped inside your head but feel safe and loved. Heal from your past issues so you won't bleed on people who never cut you, If you truly love yourself, you'll be able to give so much to others unconditionally."

We're now divorced, they're planning to marry quite literally ASAP (outrageous, right?), and this whole mess could have been avoided if we had faced this issue with more clarity and maybe with better counselors than the unhelpful ones we saw who dug nowhere deep enough.

Of course, that was just my experience.

No, no, no; ""not good enough"" is not true. People have _preferences_ and you aren't a _match_, but that doesn't mean you're less worthy of romance as you are without surgery. Even physical attraction is multifaceted. There is someone out there who may think the world of you. If you can stomach potentially being single for years (certainly not easy in our love-obsessed society), I would personally say to not settle.

If you struggle with this, then good questions to ask might be why you're with him in light of this, and why the opposite is undesirable."	Significant_Might_39	reply	na	na	na	0.9993404746055603	no	strong	no	na	selfhelp

"It sounds like some of the other things alone may be reason to not stay with him.

But to address the looks issue, I think people can have an ideal type and not date them. I‚Äôm terms of ideals everyone has a looks based best of the best in their head but it‚Äôs only looks, like a model who‚Äôs life‚Äôs work is what they look like, but LOTS of other things make someone much more attractive than what they look like. 

As people get older if noticed they seem to stray from their attractive ideal into people they really love, respect, share values with and feel are good for them. If anything feeling you‚Äôre less attractive than a partner ex, can be reframed as confirmation that they value and respect you for much more than they did their ex and for more than they do other pretty people because they had the looks and looks are out there but they want you. You sort of have to trust that if it‚Äôs such a huge issue for them and they‚Äôre not attracted to you they‚Äôll leave. I also think generally we have less respect for people we only think are attractive and nothing else. 

There will always be more attractive people than us out there it‚Äôs unavoidable and part of dating is accepting that our partner could see or meet someone at any time that they find more attractive or they get along better with or are smarter or whatever it is. But being aware of this risk isn‚Äôt worth never dating someone! 

Bumping into someone on the street who is availible attracted to you and all the things you want in a partner is pretty unlikely, and I don‚Äôt think it can really compete with what you feel for someone you already know so intimately and have feelings for, lust is normal but it‚Äôs very different to love."

Hey guys/gals 21M here. In the last couple weeks I‚Äôve slowly come to realization I let my life crumble in front of me and that if I were to die today I would not have accomplished anything valuable to myself. I recently got out a 2 and a half year relationship that ended due to her mental health becoming overwhelming to herself and she couldn‚Äôt do a relationship anymore. The breakup was much easier than my last which was a 3 year relationship that ended due to her cheating on me and getting married to the guy within a year. However with her it was different she didn‚Äôt hurt me like the last. I hurt myself. I could have done so much more yet I got comfortable with what I had. I had goals, aspirations, I was genuinely happy to live. However I‚Äôve realized every goal I had she was incorporated with and was there in my mind. I think for hours and I genuinely do not  remember the last time I was happy with myself at the end of a day. I‚Äôve always cut corners and I‚Äôve definitely taken someone‚Äôs spot that was way more deserving than me. I take the short satisfaction and escape my emotions by smoking, but at the end of the night I can‚Äôt escape them anymore. They feel so heavy and truly make me feel worthless. I go to bed every night telling myself tomorrow is different, tomorrow will change my life. Then I wake up the next day and truly cannot find anything to motivate me. Nothing feels like it‚Äôs worth it. I fall back into my comfortable and sinful ways. I feel like a fraud and a shell of a man. The shell that I lied and created to make me feel comfortable and fit in around others. I‚Äôve never been close with my parents and we butt heads a lot so they aren‚Äôt in my life much. No malice towards them or between us it‚Äôs just the type of parents they are and the differences we have. However these differences are one sided. My parents still think of me as the kid I was in high school. Top 5 in class, 7 year varsity, never touched a single drug or drink in my life. Little do they know that kid has faded. He ran away when he had the chance immediately. I‚Äôm going into my last year of college as a math major. Math was something I used to love, but college ripped that away from me, it‚Äôs ruined the beauty and admiration I had for the subject. Like genuinely I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt have any mentors in my life and I feel like I‚Äôm fighting a losing battle. I‚Äôve lost my best friend and someone I thought I would conquer the world with. Now I‚Äôm left with someone, myself, A fighter that has no hope, no goal, just fighting to stay alive. So I guess from all this I‚Äôm asking how do I find true happiness? I can‚Äôt even process what would be my goal in the future. I really just want to help people out who are less fortunate. I don‚Äôt want anything materialistic I just want to see people smile, But that‚Äôs not direct enough. It‚Äôs not enough for me to actually push towards something. Sorry for the ramble, I just sit by myself with my thoughts for so long that it‚Äôs hard to keep myself straight. Just in need of some sort of guidance/mentorship. Thank you guys, hope everyone is doing well, love you all!		post	16.298243758723686	female	White	0.9965522289276123	na	na	na	3	selfhelp

There's a guy I'm dating (not officially yet) and I do like him. But I keep feeling down when looking at pictures of us together. He's cute, don't get me wrong. But when I'm with him, I do feel like I'm big just because he's thin and not that much taller. I'm not overweight or anything, but I do have thicker thighs. So I keep going from enjoying spending time with him, to being envious of people with a partner that is much taller and a bit broader (which would make me feel smaller). All in all, I know it comes down to my self image, and I feel like it's ruining this for me. What do I do? I don't have much experience dating either. I'm 23F btw.

Stop comparing yourself to others! Stop comparing your relationships to other relationships. It's call insecurity, and that's what makes people self-sabotage their own relationships. Focus on how you feel when you're with him, and how you two work together. You're going to overanalyize everything about yourself, especially through photos, and it's just not what you should be focusing on. It's not easy, I know, but eventually, with time, you'll know and realize he doesn't care, and neither should you. Know your worth, and don't judge yourself through pictures from someone else's perspective. If it really bothers you, ask how he feels about it. Just focus on what makes being together worth it, and what you both love about each other, and eventually you'll feel less self-conscious about how you two look together. 23m.

"I'm sorry if this isn't the right place for questions like this, but I honestly do not know where to go with this and at the moment have no one to talk to.

Before the Pandemic, I was a really outgoing and fun person, who always went outside for drinks and parties with friends.

Then the Pandemic hit and we were all locked inside.

Now, after the pandemic, I find it really hard to stay at a place when me and my friends go somewhere.
We would plan this ahead, sometimes days before, sometimes it would spontaneous.
I would get ready, meet my friends, head to the bar/club/party and as soon as we enter...

BOOM

I get this feeling of not wanting to be there anymore.
I feel uncomfortable and every bit of my body tells me to leave. And as soon as I get out, I feel empty inside. Like a shell that has been carved out.

Now this situation does not happen everytime I go out with friends. But it is starting to happen more and more often, increasing rapidly. What is going on with me? This has never happened to me before.

"Hello everyone, I am 22 years old male student. When I started studying I had to move to another city.  After some time, when I was 20 years old, I started having some kind of fear, that my parents would die, that I wouldn't wake up in the morning, that I would have a heart attack, and the like. I thought things would calm down when I went home. However, when I got home, that night I couldn't sleep and I was full of thoughts, I checked my parents if they were alive (if they were breathing while they were sleeping).  Also, my heart was beating fast and I felt some kind of pressure in my chest (these things have been happening for a long time).  I couldn't sleep because of fear and I just fell asleep when it dawned.
That day I told this to my mother and I had a talk with a psychiatrist. She told me that this is anxiety and this is common, how to cope etc. The only disorder I knew about back then was ocd (and of course depression and I was sure I didn't have that). 
I knew about ocd because I have some rituals before going to bed, counting checking, and intrusive thoughts like ""What if I harm my friend"", but nothing to worry about.
I asked her if maybe I have OCD and she told me that everyone has rituals like these and I did not like the way she talk to me. I stopped listening to her and thought to myself that this is not for me and that I am perfectly fine. Magically I didn't have anxious thoughts anymore, at least for a while.

Because she did not give me the answer I wanted to hear, I started googling and found some other mental disorders like ADHD, Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia (I don't know how to write this), and other types of OCD.

As time goes by, the anxiety is there, sometimes more, sometimes less, but I can cope. NOW THERE BEGINS AN IMPORTANT PART OF MY STORY:::
I got a fear that I would jump out of the window, BUT I DONT WANT TO DO THIS. I want to live, to get a degree. But I am scared that maybe by accident I will jump from the window (I live on the 5th floor).
I didn't know what is this, and I found that this was an OCD thing
Again, I learned how to cope with that but these days I got new fear: what if I have some mental disorder like ADHD, bipolar disorder, or the one I fear the most schizophrenia. Why I have that fear I don't know.
In the day-time I am fine, but when I go to sleep at night, I have some breakdown in my mind, I have 1000 thoughts in my head and can't go to sleep, When I start dreaming, I jump scared and again I overthink, start dreaming and jump... and so on several times

When I go to sleep, my thoughts are unconnected and irrelevant, but sometimes I pay attention to some irrelevant thing and it seems to trigger me, and I tell myself that I am crazy, etc...
I feel like I'm on the edge very often.

This is one part of my story, I did not write all the things because I don't remember some things
If you want to read this and are interested ask me for some more explanations.

"Hey, those random thoughts about jumping out the window etc are called ‚Äúintrusive thoughts‚Äù, everybody has them but for people diagnosed OCD they are stronger and more frequent. Also obsessing that maybe you have a different, worse mental health issue that has somehow been missed or overlooked is an OCD symptom. 


I‚Äôm not a doctor but your symptoms just sound like classic OCD, was thinking OCD even before I got to that part of your post. It‚Äôs very very common for OCD symptoms to change or worsen following major life events, like starting school, moving to another city, moving away from family etc.


You are dealing with A LOT right now, being in your 20s gets a lot of hype but the reality is that it is one of the most difficult periods of life, with so so much pressure and a lot getting thrown at you while you are just struggling to figure out your life. The anxiety can be extremely intense and it makes sense that you would be having this experience in your mental health journey, at this point in time.


Focus on staying rooted in the reality of the moment, the thoughts are just thoughts and cannot harm you. Stay in close contact with family and your doctors/ care providers. And very important, work to create a support system where you are now living. Reach out and follow through on friendships, don‚Äôt isolate. Building strong relationships at this stage is every bit as important as education and there is no replacement for time spent in the company of others with whom you have mutual care and understanding. This is the greatest element of a happy and satisfying life. I hope the very best for you and will pray for you."	laki25	reply	na	na	na	0.016145911067724228	no	no	no	na	selfhelp

I don't isolate myself, I talk about this with my friends and family, but sometimes I have the feeling that they don't understand everything and that I'm the only one in that circle and beyond, with this problem.

"I think I might have a problem. I keep getting spontaneous tattoos. When I was in high school, I covered my left shoulder in stick n pokes and also did one on my finger (which all look horrible by the way). When I turned 18 I got my first real tattoo on my forearm, I realized that stick n pokes aren't cool and got all of mine covered up. I then didn't get any tattoos for about a year. 

In the last year, I got six new tattoos. They were all pretty spontaneous, I did a walk-in for all of them. I had no idea what to get two times, so I went to a shop that had a random tattoo dispenser and just got whatever came out of the machine. I got my last tattoo about two weeks ago and I woke up today really wanting another, so I went to the shop and got inked.

I don't regret any of my tattoos and I like the way they look, but I'm worried that I might have a somewhat unhealthy obsession with getting inked. I'm always planning my next ones as I work towards having a full sleeve. I love the feeling of having fresh ink but after about a week or two the thrill just wears off and I am left craving more ink.

"So, yeah I did the stupid mistake of sleeping with a colleague. We weren‚Äôt close colleagues, so I figured it didn‚Äôt matter. Boy did I make a mistake.

His energy: Aloof, sorta funny, undercurrent of strong independence. An air around him of: ‚Äù_I don‚Äôt belong to ya‚Äôll weirdos, but it‚Äôs chill and I don‚Äôt care, so I guess we‚Äôre hanging out_‚Äù. 

I remember looking at him, single as I am, thinking he had a really chiseled beautiful face, a sharp square jaw, big blue eyes, great hair and beard. Thought to myself ‚Äù_If you were warm, kind and caring, I‚Äôd actually be super attracted to you_‚Äù.

**But more than anything I was repulsed.** I didn‚Äôt like his personality, and I thought his bodily proportions and style and general vibe was super unsexy.

But as we all know, feelings of attraction can change.

We slept together on an _AW_, ‚Äùafter work‚Äù as we call it, a night out with the colleagues. The sex was a addictive. Not technically speaking, but I‚Äôve never been with a guy that confident. Not your ‚Äù_Look at my body_‚Äù-fake confidence, but more like ‚Äù_idgaf_‚Äù-confidence, with self-explanatory vibe. Also seeing him _somewhat_ vulnerable like that, of course it‚Äôs harder not to feel attached.

He told me ‚Äù_let‚Äôs keep it casual, huh?_. Typical. Wants to have it in his control. When he was about to leave I literally told him:

‚Äù_Fuck you_‚Äù

With a (bitter) smile on my face. I could feel he would easily hurt me without hesitating if he decided I wasn‚Äôt worth it anymore.

And so‚Ä¶ we slept for half a year, like 4 times. Didn‚Äôt speak a lot at work, but there were moments of heat in the subtlest of ways.

When I quit work there was going to be another AW out in the same work setting. And exactly 3 weeks prior, I felt his energy shift. **Ice. Distant. Avoidant. No sign of curiosity.**

Me, as the self-destructive stalker that I am, saw that all of a sudden he befriended a new cute girl every saturday night, leading up ‚Äôtil the AW. Of course this dude was sleeping around a lot, I‚Äôm not naive, but he never added new girls _that_ consistent. Of course it‚Äôd happened probably, but three weeks in a row was absolutely new‚Ä¶

When the AW finally came, only his friends could make it, but none of mine. _Worst situation **ever.**_

And what happened?

Came there un-styled, ugly sweater, gave me a pat on the back like one of the boys. When I caught another problematic colleague nodding in my direction to say ‚Äù_are you going home with her?_‚Äù my dude **literally shoved his fingers in his throat**. Imagine your high-school bully, but more subtle, so that our sheepish but kind male colleagues gang wouldn‚Äôt hate him. He did all sorts of nasty stuff that night.

_Had I known it was going to be that bad, I‚Äôd never even looked at him._

And the ‚Äùadding-girls-on-Insta-every-weekend‚Äù-behaviour stopped abruptly. He probably had new supply, but it‚Äôs still funny how it happened like that. Did he really feel the need to be in control _that_ much?????

Fucking help me. 

I can‚Äôt let this it go. 

I compare myself with the sorts of people (especially girls), he has contact with on social media. They‚Äôre from a different world. Civilised and hot, but with thay kinda idgaf flair.

I feel ugly and boring as fuck.

Sure, of course he must‚Äôve found me somewhat attractive, but I find myself _laughable_ compared to these girls he _usually_ goes for.

A part of me wonders if he liked the attention the sheepish guys at work gave him when he slept with me. I‚Äôm one of the best looking at work his age so he could easily use me as a temporary trophy in that work setting. But not by any am I his normal kinda girl. _He usually goes 5 years younger and Insta-pretty._ I‚Äôm not like that.

Is he a narcissist?

We were two people sleeping with each other. Never forced anything, I just let it happen. People are allowed to deny sex with anyone, that‚Äôs _not_ what I‚Äôm talking about.

"I go to a very small high school and there is one girl in my class who I got really close with. We never wanted to and still don't want to date, but we are very close and have gotten closer throughout the past year. She's definitely strange and every so often will sorta ignore me (which she claims is because she thinks I need space, even though I have told her I love her being around whenever she can) and she claims she is very attached to me as I am to her. Over the past two weeks I slept over her house like 4 times, and we've gotten very very close. For whatever reason, after the last time we hung out and I slept over, she started ignoring me. Just a simple ""gn"" text every other night and constantly active on instagram but leaving me on read or delivered. 

She finally invited me to hang out after two days of this and she wouldn't stop talking about how she's gonna be hanging out with a friend and drinking and possibly smoking for the first time, since she's been very sober her whole life due to family trauma. After she was done talking about herself and I tried talking she just went silent and gave one word responses. The entire time we hung out felt very tense and I knew she only invited me to hang out because she was stuck somewhere due to her mom and didn't want to hang out with the other people at school. It's fairly clear to me she doesn't really care about me and values others a lot higher than me now, seemingly out of no where.

I really don't know how to cope with this. I practically pushed others away to get closer to her and now I'm all alone for the summer. Working out and going for runs and working etc. aren't helping much to forget about her. I can't block her because I see her next year every day for our next school year. I genuinely have no idea how to stop thinking about her and I know she won't suddenly want me back again.

She doesn't care about me but I care so so fucking much about her still for some fucking reason. I need to forget about her somehow. If you've read this far, thank you so much. I'd love some advice if you have any."	throwaway_accoun8	post	13.310244727006546	female	White	0.9970122575759888	na	na	na	5	selfhelp
This is something you should learn to deal with now because it‚Äôs a dynamic that will never go away in life if you don‚Äôt figure out now. She‚Äôs a young girl living her life and for whatever reason decided you‚Äôre less important then you were before. Any time a unilateral decision is made it puts you in a really weird position on how to live your life. I would withdraw your trust from her and live your best life and be careful about continuing a relationship with her. Keep her at arms length until she proves she‚Äôs serious about being your friend again bc otherwise she will abuse your relationship (read: your feelings) by hanging out with you to satisfy her own boredom.	throwaway_accoun8	reply	na	na	na	0.9970122575759888	weak	no	no	na	selfhelp

Usually way too difficult to distract yourself with a hobby or work or something mundane. These two strategies are proven to work:

1. Another girl: Try very hard to have a unique romantic/physical experience with another girl. Even if you are faking it. It will help. Yes of course you will think about the first girl, but then it will make your irrational mind realize that there are many out there. 
2. Intense group activities: Join some type of very intense sports league, boot camp, or something that requires your time, dedication, and submission."	throwaway_accoun8	reply	na	na	na	0.9970122575759888	no	no	no	na	selfhelp
" 
Last night we argued with my bf. After he was asleep i left the room for a short walk. Then something happened to him, i dont want professional help or diagnosis here. He will of course go to a psychiatrist but it will take weeks because of the  health system. ƒ∞n the meanwhile i just want to have an idea about it. It doesnt fit into anything i know. Me(and my bf) want to further read about this. Did anyone experience  something similar. And can this be related to cptsd or ptsd. Maybe something triggered him and he had an episode like this... can anyone relate? What are your stories?    
(Also what other suitable subreddits can i crosspost this?)    
 When i returned from the walk i found him sitting on the floor with a thousand yard stare. I knew something was wrong and i sat with him and hugged him. As soon as i did he started to shake uncontrollably and twitch and cry. ƒ∞ felt him lose control of his body. All his weight was on me, i couldn't hold him no more and we fell laying on the ground. He looked like someone who just was shot in the stomach. Clamping his muscles, twitching in pain and letting out grunts and moans that he couldnt hold back(we have housemates he was trying to be quiet) his eyes were swollen and red from conracting his body and crying but there werent much tears. I put a pillow below his head.he would keep moving his hands, first laying like starfish, then he would place his hand on his stomach and dig his nails in. He would turn around, bury his face on the ground, at one point he was about to bang his head but i stopped him and placed my hands under his forehead. He started gasping. He would cover his face in agony and subconciously scratch his face. His legs were jiggling and he couldnt talk. At onr point i told him i was calling an ambulance. He shook his head aggresively. I asked do you really think this is emotional and he nodded. It wad obvious that it was hard even for him to move his head intentionlly. When he dug his fingers in his skin or did anything that might hurt, i would stop him gently, i gave him my wrists and told him he can clench tight instead. ƒ∞t went like this for... i guess half an hour but im not sure i had lost my sense of time because it was such a horrible situation. He was in terrible pain the whole time. He was holding on to the legs of the bed and unintentionally overstretching. It just looked like a transition scene out of a werewolf movie. ƒ∞ felt completely helpless and didnt know what to do except for saying; im here, dont forget to breathe and kind words.while later it found a rythym of him getting a hold of his breath, for a while, being able to relax his muscles and looking calm. Laying on his back, arms open. And then all of a sudden his face would have painful expression and he would quickly roll over to his side and end up in fetus position holding his knees, bury his face in the floor or the pillow, sob, grunt, clench and tremble. He was covered in sweat. I kept reminding him to breathe. He was unable to exhale from his mouth. ƒ∞ would help him open his lips. He altered between these two states for 2 or 3 times. I told him to blink once to say yes and dont blink to say no. Then in the times he looked calm i would ask him, is it okay to touch? (Yes) Do you act like this because it hurts? (Yes) can you open your mouth(no) can you control your body(no) does it feel like sleep paralysis(shook his arms as in i dont know) are you able to think (yes) is it just dark thoughts (yes) can i ask questions about what happened (he shooks his arms slightly) would it make it worse(yes) do you want me to talk about something or tell you about simple stuff and get you distracted (no) do you want music (no) can i go quickly to the bathroom (no) can you feel your body (yes)     
Then i tried to distract him asking does he feel hungry or does he remember what color our blanket was.    
 One of those painful states he kept raising his hand as if he was trying to reach at something and he would grip the empty air. He opened his and looked at the ceiling. His stomach looked like it was flexing again and again. He looked possessed. He started gasping, he was shaking completey and and he mumbled as he cried, he was trying so hard to talk and i finally realised he was repeating this,  ""help me please"" he kept moving his body from side to side. .    
Finally he calmed down he even got up with my help and got on the bed. But he didnt seem much concious still, even then. ƒ∞n the morning he was awake but couldnt open his eyes. He moved but barely. because it was too tiring for him. ƒ∞ helpled him, made him clench and relax some of his muscled for him to gain control, eventually after a lot of love and hugs, helping him through he was able to get up even come out with me, i needed to go to work. We work at the same place but differrnt shifts. Hr came with me talked with people even laughed but he was a little off. His movements were too slow. He told me he still felt the pain. He didn specify where exactly. He asked me did he get up on the bed himself or did i carry him, he told me he barely remembers what happened that night."	skysalight	post	23.680929084015506	male	White	0.9966039657592773	na	na	na	1	selfhelp
"This sounds very intense and definitely in need of a professional's intervention. I am not a professional  but I can just offer you my reactions which may help you frame things in a new light.
* Firstly, what amazing care and thoughtfulness you showed him during this ordeal. Many people would have walked out on him. You are a very kind and caring person. 
* You said ""we argued with my boyfriend. "" I find that an odd choice of words. Unless this is a translation issue, ordinarily people say "" I argued with..."" It makes me think there is some transference of responsibility or loss of individuality on your part. Something to ponder. 
* So, to summarize, there was an argument, you withdrew and returned to find him in a full blown breakdown/freakout/meltdown/panic attack. Clearly, something said during the argument and possibly your leaving triggered this. Emotionally stable people do not react like this. Something to ponder.
* Depending on the reason for the argument, the intended effect of said meltdown may have been to draw you back in and simultaneously divert attention away from your unmet needs, which may have been the reason for the argument. Something to ponder.
* On the other hand, your bf may have suffered so much abuse in his past that any threat to the stability of the relationship (namely, the argument and your leaving albeit momentarily) is enough to trigger a full blown melt down. Are you prepared to walk on eggshells to keep him even-keeled? Something to ponder.
* Sometimes, people are so deeply wounded that the amount of help they need exceeds our abilities. Sometimes, love alone is not enough. Tough lesson, if not the toughest lesson to learn in interpersonal dynamics. 
* Lastly, pay very close attention to how your wants/needs boundaries are impacted by his inner turmoil. You deserve serenity, stability and respect always.
I hope my reactions help you to think clearly about your situation, at the very least. I wish you the best."	skysalight	reply	na	na	na	0.9966039657592773	weak	no	no	na	selfhelp
"Over the last week or so, I‚Äôve been working with myself to become more assertive and stop letting people walk all over me. I‚Äôm already really proud of my progress. But it feels like there‚Äôs been a shift in my emotions that go beyond nerves about leaving my comfort zone.

Things that didn‚Äôt make me upset before now causes me to tear up and want to cry. Same with frustration, stress and I‚Äôm assuming anger (though I rarely get angry so it‚Äôs hard to tell).

"im exercising, sleeping well, studying, working, reading, learning a new language, trying to learn other skills also, facing my fears, literally anything i can do i do to improve my self im doing 

but i want to do more, i just don't know what

create a YouTube channel? start a company? create something useful? there is so options and i dont know what to do with it

im 21, and i literally have no friends, i know my self worth isnt based on making friends or any thing external, but i dont know what to base it on either, i know base it on internally but i dont know on what

i mistake my validation for myself for the validation of others to me

its like i get addicted to people pleasing or getting approval. but i know they wont make up happy

i talk to girls online because dating not allowed in iraq unless you do it secretly then marry, but i know this is dumb as hell, i could be doing something else instead of bothering people. 
i just dont know what


but not a single soul likes me or loves me or cares about me.

i hate that online its always me texting first and texting more and asking a ton of questions just fo get the convo rolling then it fails, because i don't know what to talk about

yesterday one told me i ask to many questions and i should stop talking, maybe im being annoying by saying to much just to try to get them to respond 

recently i fixed my addictive behavior of porn/trying to sext to every girl, now im just trying to make friends because i dont see any reason why i even want to sext or get a GF online since most live in Europe and it would be pointless. 

i think i dont talk to girls online in where i live because i really dont want a GF, since i know im not good at making friends, how would i get a GF? 

this is more about me basing my self worth on how others react or say, its exhausting, i dont care as much as i used to be its still there. 

and when girls ignore and leave on seen i keep sending them messages, maybe to prove to my self that ""Im a bad boy with charisma"" which im not, to prove to my self that im worthy of making friends 

i care about way too much about making friends, i dont know how to not care and still have friends. if i didn't care at all i would be just a lonely dude sitting in the corners.

i know my issue is self worth and self confidence i just don't know what to chase. what to fight for, whats my passion, what do i want, why do i even want friends. 

im way better than 3 years ago. i would fap 8 times a day. now i have better control over my self and emotions

and try to recognize my ""approval seeking behaviors"" i just dont know what i should change my behavior to, i don't know who i want to be.
i want to be assertive/confident/cool/funny/witty but i don't know how. before saying anything i think of ways to be all of these together in one sentence. but most of the time i can't think of anything

i run out of things to talk about quickly, most of these chats with these girls are not even conversations, its mostly awkward ""Why did you text me"" or ""What do you want"" when i would just send ""How is it going"" probably a boring starter as well

maybe im just annoying as hell in general and no one likes me and its that simple. 

its like im so desperate and sad just to get approval and others attention, its pathetic i know. im aware of it. 

i know there's more to life than just sex and girls. 

im either nice or an asshole, no middle ground most of the time

like what are conversations about? what do i say? what should i say? its so hard. 

i literally dont know what to say. 

its like people smell desperation a mile away, how do i change this? 

how do i change my people pleasing behavior? how do i change my desperate traits?

i deleted my social medias, hopefully never downloading them again. its like a weight lifted off me

i dont want to be a boring normal ""Nice guy"" with no personality traits other than ""Nice"" i want to love my self so i can finally stop living misrabley, i want to take control over my life, my emotions and thoughts, go after what i want and my passions and work towards my goals, which i dont know what are those yet"	Butcher__1	post	17.20685346693262	male	White	0.9924956560134888	na	na	na	2	selfhelp

"I've struggled with anxiety and depression for over 15 years. I tried medications and various therapists, which offered a bit of reprieve.  I did the 10-day Vipassana meditation course ""by donation"" (which may help your situation). It is not therapy exactly, but I learned to break the habits of my mind and train myself to view life with more equanimity. I could explore painful memories from my past and lessen their grip on my present. Living monastic life allowed me to isolate problems and make necessary changes when returning to everyday life. It has been challenging to keep the learnings and be kind to myself when I inevitably fall into old habits.

Anyway, I'm sure if I completed this experience when I was younger, it would have saved me much misery. However, I might not have had the life experience that allowed me to persevere through the course.

Having fought mental illness for years, I know how hard that fight can be, and I respect you for reaching out for help, striving to better yourself, and putting up with so much suffering.

- Spending 30+ minutes outside
- Having some form of daily exercise
- Hydration & proper nutricion
- Learn more about the mind, so you can put things in perspective

Those alone will help more (over time) than medication is going to.

But I'd say the most important thing would be to think about the life you really want to live, the person you want to become and the goals you want to achieve. Progress is one of the most powerful ways of getting more satisfaction and fulfillment from life.

Life is inherently meaningless, unless you give meaning to it yourself.

No amount of motivational posts can fix me, no self help books.. there‚Äôs nothing in this life for me, nor for anyone
It‚Äôs just an illusion.. a sad one

Two days ago i went to bed after work and I slept until the next day (almost 18 hours) 
When I woke up i found peace knowing what death felt like, and i am no more scared of it
I woke up and everything was fine, life kept going and birds were singing while i was gone on my bed
I can‚Äôt wait to die.. sleeping was the best feeling I have experienced.. to not exist anymore
I can‚Äôt wait to just lie in peace and disappear"	Emotionlesssunny	post	20.28450687544549	male	White	0.9971332550048828	na	na	na	9	selfhelp
"If you don't read through this, I'd suspect you're not even trying. 

Please read this shit. I wrote it with a migraine shit took forever lmfao.

Listen my friend, you sound young so I'm going to help you. You most likely have untreated/unmedicated ADHD and that's like honestly horrible within it self. I just got on vvyanse a month ago and a lot of my life changed. I was just like you big dawg! Hear me out.

8 months ago I was on an LSD trip when I caught my girlfriend of 2 years sleeping with my cousin while my best friend swore nothing was going on. At the PEAK (strongest point) of my LSD trip I experienced that shit. I fucking hated myself dude. She broke up with me and I completely relied on her for happiness. So when she left I was extremely depressed and sewer slidal (not trying to get my account banned, but I'm sure you know what I mean) I've been depressed and sewer slidal my entire life.. I'm 19 years old bro. 

I've had daily headaches since I was 12 years old because my family used to abuse the shit out of me and gave me tons of skull fractures, brain damage, and ended up breaking my spine. I'm currently on my 2nd day of no sleep rolling around in pain wishing I could trade problems with ya! 

My mom made me move to a new town far away from anyone I've known because she got a new job. I lost everything and became extremely sewer slidal and stopped showing up to school n shit so my mom threw all my shit in the snow kicked me out and made my ass homeless. I was escorted by police and had 15 minutes to pack up and find a place to stay. I ended up staying with a random ass family 30 minutes away that I found from going to the local gas station in my small town of minnesota. 

Sounds crazy right? Yeah.. that shit fucking sucked. Horrible people. I paid a cab over $300 to get back to my roots (my childhood town) and was homeless again, but in a more familiar area so I could stay with a friend! Haha yeah no. I lost all my friends because when I was gone my Ex girlfriend was sleeping with all of them, making lies that I rape her and shit to justify her cheating. Which is crazy considering we dated for 2 years. Lmaoo. 

Long story short ended up staying with a car detailer and I thought forsurely I'd have access to the shower and sleeping on the floor since I was detailing tons of cars and shoveling pounds and pounds of heavy, tall ass snowed in driveways. But this was not the case at all... he made me sleep [here](https://imgur.com/a/0pBpybN) and it would be -9¬∞ everynight freezing my ass off on oil slicked floors. I got awful anxiety so I never fell asleep. Like ever. He would come in at 5am and make me shovel, in the middle of nowhere on a farm and would never feed me proper food. 

Man I hated myself, hated life, everything sucked, fuck fuck fuck. That type of mental mindframe. 

I was homeless yet again and got to sign up for this program where they let you sleep in shitty ass motels but it was not bad. It fucked up my health a lot because there was black mold and slimemold and it's costed me thousands in reverse damages... BUT who gives a shit lmao. 

Point I'm trying to make is, ALLLLL these thoughts, emotions, mental frames that you have installed are there for a reason. You need hardships and battles my friend. Men who can't deal with mental and or physical pain are not good at being men. Those are boys ahha. 

And it's not about ""Man Up"" that's bullshit women love a vulnerable man. But you need to learn to love yourself in the midst of shit bro. You're gonna be stuck in the head of yours. The rest, of your life. Better start to like it! Right? 

Best part of the story then I'm going to bed (1:29 PM currently) 

I made a post to Reddit saying I'm gonna end my life or do some crazy shit because I can't get my health fixed and basically wrote the same sentences you wrote on Reddit.

Some guy from Seattle said ""do some crazy shit, move in with me"" and I was like whatever fuck it, would rather get axe murdered then take a bunch of shitty pills. So I bought the ticket with the last of my money and took a train all the way to Seattle. 

That was 3 months ago, I've learned so much through all my suffering, I couldn't even imagine not liking myself at this point. Went from hating myself to loving myself. 

It's not gonna be from fuckin books or Instagram reels bro haha you gotta go through some shit. Keep your head up. 

If you read through all this, shoot me a reply. I don't ever write to people but I saw myself in you. And know what's it's like to suffer and be numb when no one gives a shit. Shoot me a reply, don't shoot yourself!"	Emotionlesssunny	reply	na	na	na	0.9971332550048828	weak	no	no	na	selfhelp
I can‚Äôt tell you how much it feels like I wrote this, even just a year ago. I have been where you are and I understand everyone‚Äôs experience is different, but reading your words I remember being in that headspace. All I can tell you is that I felt and thought the same exact things. Nothing mattered, literally nothing. And I couldn‚Äôt see how other people didn‚Äôt see that. I couldn‚Äôt understand how people were just living, and even enjoying it. I don‚Äôt have any solution for you, nor does it sound like you‚Äôre really looking for one but for what it‚Äôs worth here‚Äôs what happened for me that changed in the past year. 1, I got on a mood stabilizer. Antidepressants never helped me, but this helped, at least a little. But the biggest thing and I didn‚Äôt expect this, was literally just time. I never thought the numbness, the nothingness would ever leave me. I just kept‚Ä¶.living even though I didn‚Äôt care about it. The one thing I‚Äôve learned is nothing will ever stay the same, even if it feels endless, and when you‚Äôre there it absolutely feels endless. But it‚Äôs not and it will change. The way you feel will change at some point, it has to. All I can say is, I‚Äôm really glad I stayed and I never thought I would be saying those words. We‚Äôll all die some day anyway, but in the mean time I hope you keep living, even if it‚Äôs ‚Äújust because‚Äù for now.

"_You're a very lucky fellow. I wish I could have been that lucky when I was younger""_

Somebody said this to me recently, and it‚Äôs a recurring theme I see at least once every 2 weeks. Someone will directly say to me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve found success, you‚Äôre very lucky.‚Äù Throughout my journey thus far, whenever I earn success, I‚Äôve had people say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky!‚Äù

I‚Äôve heard it said to other friends too; my mate recently earned (notice I said earned) a promotion, I told a few people about it, and some said, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very lucky‚Äù.

*   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôre white.‚Äù
    
*   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôre 6ft tall.‚Äù
    
*   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky to have such a beautiful girlfriend‚Äù
    
*   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky to have such an awesome job‚Äù.
    
*   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky to have such a strong, fit body.‚Äù
    
*   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôre so well-read and educated.‚Äù
    
*   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky your parents are still together.‚Äù
    
*   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.""
    

Fuck off. Luck usually has very little to do with someone‚Äôs success. And even if luck had a lot to do with it, that doesn‚Äôt take away from all the effort the person had to put in to get to where they are. Luck and hard work are not mutually exclusive.

And in the cases where it‚Äôs genuinely luck ‚Äì eg, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you were born tall‚Äù, you‚Äôre cherry-picking one lucky attribute and ignoring all the unlucky attributes the person was born with. They might be tall, but do they have a stutter? Maybe they‚Äôre extra neurotic? Maybe they were born into poverty, maybe they have terrible insomnia, maybe they‚Äôre terrible at making friends, maybe they have crippling depression underneath that tall exterior you so enviously covet. **Don‚Äôt pick one isolated attribute and act like it‚Äôs the only attribute that person has.**

Obviously when you chalk someone‚Äôs successes up to luck, you‚Äôre taking away from all the hard work they‚Äôve put in. Speaking from experience, when you achieve something great (anything that takes a minimum 12+ months or longer of hardcore, total obsession to achieve), it NEVER comes easily.

*   You‚Äôll make a million mistakes, look like a fool 10,000 times, and constantly wonder if you‚Äôll ever get anything right.
    
*   If it‚Äôs anything that involves dealing with other people (sales, starting a new business, dating / relationships) you‚Äôll be rejected hundreds or thousands of times, which will absolutely eat away at your confidence and self-esteem, especially early on.
    
*   You‚Äôll have moments where you feel completely cut off from everybody else, stuck in your own lonely existence, because you‚Äôre suffering now (relentless hard work can be torture sometimes) while they all seem to be happy now. (Don‚Äôt worry; the hard work will pay off eventually).
    
*   You‚Äôll have moments where you want to give up. Hundreds of moments.
    
*   You often lose track of where the finish line is, and where you started, and you find it hard to tell if you‚Äôre even making any progress at all (are you just spinning your wheels?)
    
*   Doubt. Oh, the doubt. ‚ÄúAm I doing the right thing?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs this goal even achievable?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo other people think I‚Äôm a loser for working on this goal?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo my friends/loved ones think I‚Äôm too obsessed with this goal?‚Äù ‚ÄúOther people that achieved this were smarter/stronger/better than me, I don‚Äôt think I can do what they did.‚Äù etc.
    
*   At some point, once the initial excitement of the goal wears off, you enter what Arnold Schwarzenegger calls ‚ÄúThe Pain Period‚Äù where it‚Äôs a total un-fun grind, you know you‚Äôre miles from your goal, and you‚Äôve just gotta stick at it day-in, day-out. That can be absolute hell.
    

And as well as taking away from the person‚Äôs hard work (‚Äúhellish work‚Äù is probably more accurate), you‚Äôre doing something even more nefarious:

**You‚Äôre giving yourself permission to not even try.**

This right here is THE REASON people say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so lucky‚Äù. It‚Äôs not that their main intention is to take away from your achievements (well it is, a little bit). Their main intention is to give themselves an excuse not to have to repeat your hard work and earn the successes you‚Äôve earned.

If you're looking for a reasons to give up, you'll find one.

And I get it. I just wrote a long list of all the ways in which you suffer and struggle on the path of reaching a meaningful goal. It‚Äôs HARD. It‚Äôs HELL. You‚Äôll struggle daily, you‚Äôll constantly wonder if you‚Äôll ever reach your goal, you‚Äôll wonder why the hell you ever took on this monumental task. I wouldn‚Äôt wish the struggle upon anyone.

But I‚Äôd wish the SUCCESS on everyone. Literally anyone can do what I or anyone else who‚Äôs achieved goals has done. It‚Äôs literally just consistent daily effort, over a long enough time period.

By saying, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so lucky‚Äù, you‚Äôre writing it off as something they only have because ‚Äúthe universe pre-ordained it‚Äù; which means that you could never have it. Because they‚Äôre lucky, and you‚Äôre unlucky. Which means you get to sit on your couch and continue eating potato chips while watching TV, never having to worry, ‚ÄúAm I wasting my potential? Could I achieve my goals, like he did?‚Äù

If you are envious of what others have, you either need to:

a) Go for it and make it happen yourself; or

b) Accept that you don‚Äôt really want it, and thus give yourself permission to let it go & move on with something else.

Most people know they can‚Äôt pick option b), because deep down they really DO want to achieve their goals. But option a) is scary as hell. Instead, a lot of people opt for a third option, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll say he‚Äôs just lucky, so I don‚Äôt have to emulate his hard work and struggles‚Äù. They continue to want the goal/achievement, lament others who have it, but tell themselves they can‚Äôt have it because they‚Äôre just ‚Äúunlucky‚Äù.

Eventually ‚ÄúI‚Äôm unlucky‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt achieve that goal because of reason x, y, z‚Äù becomes the default habit, and they never achieve anything they want to achieve.

It‚Äôs learned helplessness.

It‚Äôs fixable though. Just stop making excuses, admit you really DO want to achieve that goal, and then start taking steps to make it happen.

People who want to change/improve, will find ways to improve. They‚Äôll Google resources, read books, ask other people, or even experiment and try and find the answer themselves, through trial and error. They‚Äôll do whatever it takes to reach their goals.

It‚Äôs up to YOU to make shit happen.

[This motherfucker was born without any limbs](https://mashable.com/2015/06/19/born-without-limbs/), yet he‚Äôs pushed himself to live an awesome life ‚Äì he travels around the world giving motivational speeches and set up his own not-for-profit. He chose not to let bullshit excuses get in his way ‚Äì he earned his success. What right do you have to complain about your ‚Äúunluckiness‚Äù when he was born with 4 less limbs than you and is still out there getting shit done?

In a similar vein, I‚Äôve never understood the concept of living vicariously through someone else instead of achieving things for yourself. Celebrity/idol worship is insane to me. If you like what someone else has, don‚Äôt you want that for yourself? Why would anyone be content to watch other people achieve success, while not going for it themselves, justifying it with terrible excuses like, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just lucky‚Äù?

Nuts. Absolutely nuts.

## The Takeaway

If you want to actually start being a decent man, own your shit and start improving yourself. Stop telling yourself your life is out of your control and you're a victim to the luck of the draw."	LimeRevolutionary184	post	19.230179917562168	female	White	0.9961154460906982	na	na	na	2	selfhelp

"sorry in advance for my bad english

for context, I started drinking at a very young age and I'm 8 months sober now. sometimes i still get cravings, but I'm doing so much better overall, it's much more easier to resist the urge, so I'mvery happy about that. the point is, in the period i was first trying to get sober i started self harming (cuts, stuff like that). it wasn't often, something that happened every one/one and a half month or so.

the problem is, it still happens that i self-harm and i really can't help it. at some point during a random day i would just feel so anxious and overwhelmed by everything and in 3 minutes, here i am, I've done it again. how can i calm down? how can i stop myself? i just feel like i lose control over myself when it happens...

Better attitudes means we lose less energy on negative thoughts-emotions-actions. 

Being kind and forgiving towards self and life. Trust in life and the process.

"For a little backstory, I'm not the best person, both health-wise and socially. I'm overweight, I eat all the time, I hate being active, and I tend to be self-centered, making everything about me or lying to make people feel bad for me.

I don't know why I do this, but at any given moment, I can have two different feelings. Half the time, I want to change. I want to be better. I tell myself that the next day, I'm gonna be better. I'm gonna start working out, I'm gonna start a diet, etc. But then when the moment comes to make that decision of actually being better, or just doing the same old unhealthy stuff, I choose the easy route. I do the unhealthy thing, as if I don't care anymore.

I tend to find myself not accepting help from others, even though I ask for it. I try to talk to people to feel better, but when they give me actual help and solutions, I deny it and come up with excuses. It's almost like I enjoy being unhappy.

I've been starting to genuinely believe that I enjoy being unhappy, but there's some issues with that theory. I eat to feel better, I play videogames to feel better. It's like there's two different people in my head. One wants to be happy, and would do anything, but the other just wants to do the easy thing and doesn't care how happy I am, as long as life is easy. I don't know why I do this."

I think you value the opinion others have on you too much. Lying to make people feel bad for you etc. If you choose to eat too much or play a lot of games that's fine, but that is your choice. Seems like you might just be taking the easy route rather than life being a struggle right now. Maybe you have some past trauma, or just wish you did. But overall this just seems to stem from having confidence issues, hence needing other peoples opinions to validate yourself.

After the session was weird, I started stress cleaning, but I felt very out of body, I think I started to dissociate. It lasted for about an hour and a half, which I feel is a strong reaction. I‚Äôm going to ask about techniques to handle big feelings post session. 

I‚Äôm also giving up drinking for the rest of the year, and going back to school in September for a graduate certification program after being in an unhealthy work environment this past year.

"Hello! First time posting here, 

My main issue is that I have the belief that men shouldn't do anything that would be perceived as ""Unmanly"" which is causing me alot of issues when It comes to jobs, Hobbies, friends and family. 

I get upset and distressed if I do anything that I perceive as unmanly and this has been ruining my life for some time now. I am now on antidepressants which has helped but I would like to find a way to change this belief permenantly. 

&#x200B;

I have already done some CBT therapy which hasn't really helped. So I am looking for alternate methods. 

Does anyone know how?"	CorgiBruzer	post	24.932179809259456	female	White	0.9880998134613037	na	na	na	1	selfhelp

" Beginning  with context about my life: I am a 21 year old female that was disowned  by my family. They were severely abusive to me my entire life,  including physical, mental, and sexual abuse. My parents are immigrants  from Central America, but I was born here in the US. They are extremely  poor. I left/was kicked out because we never saw eye-to-eye on anything,  they wanted me to be a devout Catholic but I hated the Church, they  constantly abused me, and I eventually came out as transgender. I wasn't  their perfect child and they genuinely hated me for it. I left/got  kicked out right after I turned 18 and was just set loose into the world  for myself. I was lucky I got a hand-me-down car from the literal only  good person in my entire family, my uncle, and had $2000 secretly saved  up from working minimum wage in high school. I found a roommate online  in a Discord server and moved in with them, and I still live with them  now. They're now my best friend and one of the only people I trust  anymore. I still work minimum wage and both my friend and I can only  stay afloat monetarily because we both work AND my friend gets economic  help from her parents. Even still, we both have no extra money and  barely make by every month.

I hate looking at my bank account. A week or so ago it was in the negative,  and I had no savings, no physical cash, not a single cent to my name or  anywhere in my possesion, and still owed the bank money. I just cashed  my check and I'm back in the positive but it's only a matter of time  before something takes my money and I'm left broke again. Right now, I  have just enough for rent. If I want to make rent in two weeks, I am  going to have to spend money on literally nothing else, no food, no gas,  nothing. I'm struggling. I know, we're all struggling. But I can't keep  living like this, living check-to-check, constantly on the knife's edge  of debt and economic collapse. There's nothing else I can do to cut  spending back that I know of. How do I get out of this cycle and  actually have enough to pay my bills and put something, anything, into  savings and improve my life? I know there's no cheat code to this, but I  so desperately want there to be. There has to be a way out of this. I  can't keep doing this.

Should I go  to college? I have lived in my current state for a few years so I  should qualify for in-state tuition. if I'm lucky with the FAFSA I  shouldn't have to pay as much as I fear. But if I attend college? what  should I do about my living space? I live with a roommate in a rented  apartment. Should I stay with my current roommate, my best friend, and  swamp myself with both schoolwork and actual work and hope I don't  collapse within the 4-6 years it'll take to get a degree, all while  still working to keep our bills paid? Should I move into the dorm,  possibly putting myself in even more debt because of the cost, and  forcing my roommate to somehow live on their own? If I go to college,  what should I study? The only two things I would want to go to college  for is art or teaching. Anything in art feels like a gamble I don't want  to take, I think it's very likely that I'm just gonna be left with a  degree worth nothing and a pile of debt, and I don't think a career in  teaching would be worth it, as I don't think I would make any more than  my current job, as overworked and underpaid teachers are.

Could  I find a different, better paying job? I currently work a minimum wage  job, working in a toy store, and while it doesn't have the best hours,  it's the best job I've gotten since I moved here. I like the work and I  like my boss. All my previous jobs, namely food service and retail,  either forced me to work 60+ hours a week, only to screw me over by not  paying me what I was due, or forced me to into extremely long commutes  that were entirely reliant on my junker car that has already cost me  thousands to keep running and is only gonna cost me more the more I  drive. I have tried getting a new car, but I can't, the payments are too  high and the interest rates are literally more than 25%.

I  just don't know what to do, I'm lost, struggling, and honestly scared. I  hate asking for help, I'm scared to ask for money, other people have  their own struggles and I can't bring myself to make their lives worse  by taking from them.

How do I get out of this? How do I save money, how do I better my life? It feels like I can't and like I have nowhere to go."	Throwaway-10251	post	24.27929903920842	female	White	0.9973868727684021	na	na	na	3	selfhelp
"Well you gotta do something. Ain't no one gonna give you handouts on the internet. You can go to your local college campus and visit the student financial aid office to get all the info you need. I'd suggest doing that. STEM fields pay off the most, but if you aren't prepared or in a good enough mental state to dedicate yourself to a 4-yr degree, you need to consider taking up employment at Costco or some unionized workforce to have protected benefits. Look into manufacturing jobs. They tend to pay decently well and come with a full array of benefits. 

Military is also a strong option to kickstart your life. Army/Navy/AF is a good way to get benefits and activate yourself in a way that will move you in a positive direction. 

Help is out there for those who seek it. I would say talk to as many people as you can (even strangers). Most people are willing to offer their help and advice to an earnest person seeking real advice.

Your goal should be to save as much as possible. Get a place with several roommates (good people who don't have bad habits). Cook at home, don't go out to spend money. Do free shit, like library, park, mall, etc."	Throwaway-10251	reply	na	na	na	0.9973868727684021	weak	no	no	na	selfhelp
"I'd like to offer three things in regards to advice, and a single word of reassurance.

1.  Her First 100K and the related podcast and book ""Financial Feminist"" are fantastic resources to help you both be educated AND inspired.  Check that out!  And remember that the library may have a copy if you can't afford to buy one.  However, you don't need it - all of the info in the book is included in the podcast episodes.

2. Find your local food pantry and start using it.  It's there for people like you.  

3. Consider asking your boss for a raise.  It would help to have comparison hourlies for similar roles, if your boss is not paying market rate.  If your boss IS paying market rate, you can still have a raise conversation by talking to him or her about what more you can do for additional compensation - a more demanding role, additional responsibilities?

A word of encouragement: You are young and life looks bleak right now.  No one can guarantee anything, I know - but having been in financial straits that made me question whether or not I wanted to still be breathing, I can tell you it did get better for me BUT it took me until my late 30s to get there.  I do believe if I'd had started with the kind of advice that Tori gives in the FF podcast, I'd have saved myself MANY years of severe financial anxiety.  This is something you CAN work to improve.

"Thankfully when I was your age I had nowhere near as many hardships in my past, but I was similarly stuck in a position of having few opportunities and options. I did have family support, but to build your own life, you need to develop enough skill sets to always have options. 
I followed my father‚Äôs lead and joined the Navy. There are obvious risks involved in joining the military,  (though far less than a person might find in the streets) but you‚Äôd have shelter, sustenance, and support while you build, and better yourself for the future. Bootcamp is just hard enough to break you down to the point that you can be rebuilt with better focus and discipline, compared to what you‚Äôve already experienced, this would at least be a little bit of suffering in pursuit of a positive goal. 
Whatever you end up doing, keep building. If you decide to stay working retail, you could apply to someplace like Home Depot or Lowe‚Äôs where you can get trained on forklifts adding another marketable skill set and increasing your employment options. 
You can have a good life OP, choose a path for now that has growth, work hard at that, then choose another more challenging path later after you‚Äôve grown.

"It‚Äôs not unusual for a person to think they‚Äôre doing worse than they actually are. Some of us are pessimistic, others have limiting beliefs lurking: I‚Äôm not good enough, I‚Äôm not worthy ‚Äì progress is just luck, setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.

### Consider these positive signs:

¬∑ **You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it‚Äôs overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviours. But you can choose to respond differently ‚Äì and achieve different outcomes

¬∑ **You‚Äôre clear on what you want ‚Äì and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life. 

¬∑ **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. 

¬∑ **You‚Äôre making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress ‚Äì driven by consistent effort and learning ‚Äì will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

¬∑ **You‚Äôre not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you‚Äôre not alone, you‚Äôre doing better than many others.

¬∑ **You‚Äôre committed.** You know who you are and what you‚Äôre about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.

¬∑ **You consider other‚Äôs opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn‚Äôt. You live your life, not theirs. 

¬∑ **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and ‚Äì crucially ‚Äì on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don‚Äôt even realise.

¬∑ **You‚Äôre authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.

When you‚Äôre clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and you‚Äôre spending your time wisely, you‚Äôre doing well ‚Äì and better than most! This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

**Genuine Desire + Effective Strategy + Consistent Persistence = Authentic Results**

"If I had to pick one of the things I can change  about myself, it would be that I cry too easily. Now, crying every single time watching the Titanic is fine but my problem is that I burst into tears every time someone raises their voice at me.

When someone lectures me or scolds me for my mistake with their voice raised, I can't help but cry a bucket of tears and snot even if I understand why they got mad and understand that I deserve a scolding.

I know that along the way I'll meet even more mentors, seniors or heads that aren't the soft and patient kind and I don't wanna cry at every turn, that's why I'd really love some advice on this or a way to approach this.

Accept your emotions and your need to release your emotions. If you can, set a boundary for yourself in your environment and walk away to be alone to cry or release the feelings you are feeling. Personally I am very introspective, so I like to talk out my feelings to myself, so that I can understand where my feelings stem from. Crying is a self soothing mechanism, so if you want to change your soothing mechanism from crying to not crying, try practicing soothing inner talk like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, and everything will be okay‚Äù or ‚Äúthis bothered me, because ____, but I am strong enough to get through this‚Äù. I also like to hug myself and rub my arms or legs and remind myself ‚Äúthis feeling is temporary, but this feeling is okay‚Äù. Practice inner kindness and empathy and through that, you shall find inner strength. It takes time (like all things), but slowly you will build inner confidence and inner control of your emotions through navigating self talk and soothing touch from yourself.

My partner cries easily. I think part of it was because they are naturally conflict avoidant and emotional person. so this kinds stuff stressed them out more. In addition their past relationship was unhealthy(borderline abusive). I don‚Äôt think their crying easily is a bad thing and appreciate their sensitivity. once they felt accepted for their emotions and stopped thinking of their crying as a bad thing, it became much less frequent and easy for them to stop it when the timing was wrong. So let yourself cry, or cry about it later, it‚Äôs not wrong of you to be sensitive.	PJJPIAN	reply	na	na	na	0.9930101037025452	no	strong	no	na	selfhelp

So the reason is we are too emotional but slowly we need to control it it's okay to cry...when we feel bad..something hurts us..but one day tears will stop because it know the person infront of you don't value it so you don't have to waste time or tears on it."

My friend is a bombshell. She posts selfies on instagram all the time, usually sexy/scandalous pictures, and she gets tons of male validation.

I‚Äôm not drop dead gorgeous, don‚Äôt photograph great, and I deleted social media because I felt so much pressure to live up to the beauty standards. I went out to dinner with this friend today and my other friend and they had me take pictures of them for like 10-15 minutes. And then in the car on the way home my friend didn‚Äôt talk at all because she was editing pictures for instagram. Inside, they were both on their phones editing pictures for their instagram as we sat in complete silence. I‚Äôm annoyed by the validation she gets, I feel less than her because the guy I liked is in her dms, I‚Äôm annoyed by the constant phone usage and selfie obsession, I don‚Äôt even know.

But I can tell you this. I‚Äôm now 43. I have a kid, I have a business. 
I wake up everyday and face responsibilities.
I take care of my aging mom, raise my child and try to be as kind to myself and healthy as i can be.
The work I do in a day, making money and watching my kid grow up is so rewarding.
I try to look my best, have nice hair and clothes etc. but at the end of the day, what matters to me is my loved ones.
My career is fulfilling, my role as a mom, daughter and sister gives me self esteem.
Most days I full really good about myself.
How I look in pictures on social media doesn‚Äôt matter.
I am currently a bit overweight and I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm attractive to men, I can see that. And I don‚Äôt need their approval.
Ultimately I need my own approval to be sane and healthy.
Young women that base their self worth on their looks will eventually face an uphill battle as they age because looks so fade, life give you wrinkles and weight gain and stretch marks and that‚Äôs all the beauty of living a full enjoyable life.
At my age, I can tell who drinks or doesn‚Äôt exercise. It‚Äôs all over their faces.

"You‚Äôre talking about the Internet, not real life. The attention is from men online, the guy you like is messaging her online, she‚Äôs editing pictures (note: advertising to men) to post online. You‚Äôve chosen not to participate in being online. So you can‚Äôt really be mad about not getting something when you‚Äôre not even trying to get it. 

The shitty reality is that we aren‚Äôt all bombshells and most of us have been in a friend group with a hotter friend. It sucks but short of plastic surgery that‚Äôs just life for most of us. I competed by having something super interesting going on. Normal average dudes are going to flock to my hotter friend but interesting dudes check out what I have going on. The normal  average dudes give up on the hot friend when they realize they only exist for a constant source of validation where I‚Äôve built a relationship. 

If you absolutely must have internet validation from men, find something about yourself and there‚Äôs men out there that have a fetish for it. Like your feet or if your chubby or whatever. Hone in on presenting it to dudes online like your friends do and dudes will objectify you. 

A better suggestion is to actually stop holding yourself to these standards like you‚Äôve tried to do by deleting social media. Stop hanging out with vapid Internet hoes. Get a real life hobby. Meet people who also do that hobby. Build satisfying real life relationships based on those things and earn respect from people based on your skills. Those people will value the actual person who is you. All the dudes on instagram don‚Äôt value your friend, she‚Äôs just a hot chick on the Internet to them. There are literally millions of them and just as many dumb dudes who are into that. Be better. Crave quality people and real life experiences with them."
