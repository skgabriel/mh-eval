"Thanks to the 1012 people who completed [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/nx1z22/memes_on_rsocialanxiety_please_vote_and_comment/) poll last month.

The results indicate only half our users (48%) are happy with the current situation regarding memes.

21% of users would like no memes at all, or prefer to see the memes in another location

25% only want to see memes specifically about SA and do not want 'off topic' memes

​

**Why move memes to another sub?**

Apart from the significant number of people unhappy with them, /r/SocialAnxiety has been first and foremost a support sub for people with SA.

Memes are highly upvoted and commented which means the Algorithm may place them in subscription feeds to the exclusion of support requests from humans.

The memes dont need our support. Humans do.

We dont want people missing out because memes.

​

**But less memes?**

This is up to you guys. We hope everyone who likes them can keep enjoying them at the new sub. 

If you are passionate about memes, and keeping the flow going, you can kick things of by:

**a) joining** /r/sa_memetherapy

and 

**b) posting memes!**"	AltitudinousOne	post	17.549391025609324	male	White	0.003707201685756445	na	na	na	17	socialanxiety

this used to be the first space i could openly exchange with people experience regarding SA and find similarities and there used to be 1-2 memes which made the general atmosphere more fun and normal, but then it ended up being a meme channel of ridiculing SA and you had to dig to find any topics where you could actually share and exchange	AltitudinousOne	reply	na	na	na	0.003707201685756445	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"I went to get my routine sub after a workout and the manager was serving me, I could see how bad her employee was struggling and she was almost actively enjoying it.

I had one interaction where I thought the manager was being rude and I thought fuck it we’re going in 😂😂 I told the manager I didn’t feel comfortable being served by her, I found her patronising and I didn’t like the atmosphere she created with her staff.

I then proceeded to praise and talk to her trainee employee the whole way through eventually she struggled with rolling up my wrap to the point the manager asked “am I allowed to wrap it up for you then?” To which I answered “No, she’s doing a perfectly good job and I’m enjoying her company” 

I really enjoyed the whole interaction, the trainee had a beaming smile on her face and honestly I felt so confident and like myself, I think anger really overrides my anxiety sometimes and it was really nice to feel like I had the power to actually use my voice and help someone"	Kaedex_	post	22.115785060417757	male	White	0.0013212753692641854	na	na	na	18	socialanxiety

"We both used to be very quiet and socially anxious people which I feel like is how we initially bonded lol. I however still have really bad social anxiety, but over the past few years she's gained a lot more confidence and I've realised we're actually not similar at all

She always wants to do things like go to exercise classes or go kayaking or go travelling - none of which are really my thing but I still often agree to go along just cause she's my friend. But every time we do these things she always kind of gets frustrated and looks down on me like I'm not good enough - not good enough at kayaking, not fit enough when she led us on a giant hike, or looks at me like I'm stupid for crying in the middle of London when I got overwhelmed with the crowds. Even though these things were her idea and I never really wanted to do them in the first place. I feel like I always have to apologise to her for being so 'incompetent'

In reality I'm perfectly happy just going out to a cafe or going on a short walk whenever we meet up, but every single time I suggest something she's always like 'no I don't wanna do that, let's do *this* instead'. And when I try to start a conversation about something I'm interested in she always looks so uninterested and cuts me off which just makes me *more* socially anxious cause then I'm afraid to speak at all

And in the past year or 2 she seems to have suddenly gained about 5 new close friends and now goes to all sorts of clubs and classes and on these grand trips. And it kinda feels like she's looking down on me for still only having 1 friend and no social life and still being the same socially anxious person I was 10 years ago.

It's like she's completely forgotten what it's like to have social anxiety. Nowadays she gets annoyed when I'm too shy to ask for the bill in a restaurant even though she was the exact same just a few years ago

I was gonna say 'she's still a nice person, we're just not that similar anymore'... but writing this has made me realise she's actually not a very nice person lmao. I don't even think I'm asking for advice here, I think I just wanted to rant because I have no one to speak to about it IRL

But basically I feel like I'd rather have no friends at all at this point, somehow seems less lonely than having to socialise with someone like this"	dreamer_luna	post	26.415723904168395	male	White	0.9994114637374878	na	na	na	5	socialanxiety

I've been going through this with my group of friends recently. We bonded as we were outcasts in school and had alot in common, but over the years they gained new friend groups and I didn't. It used to upset me but then I realised I'm not really the type of person to go out looking for a friend group so I learned to be pretty content with my situation.	dreamer_luna	reply	na	na	na	0.9994114637374878	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
The saddest fact of life is that people change, even those you thought were similar as you can turn out to be really different. It hurts, but letting go of friendships that no longer serves you is better than holding on to what they used to be. Personally, having had the same struggles as you, it is baffling that she starts treating you like shit instead of being kind and encouraging towards you to overcome social anxiety together.

"Its a form of high functioning autism where your IQ and intelligence is not affected (in fact many people with aspergesr have an above average IQ), but your ability to socialise is compromised. Many of us on the mild side of hte spectrum were awkward as kids and got bullied, leading to ptsd and social anxiety. If you feel like you spend so much effort nad time and reserach into learning basic social skills and non-verbal communication, etc. if you have ""obsessive interests"", if you feel like your mental age is younger than your real age, if you feel like you always are the ""odd one out"", etc. you really need to reserach into aspergers symptoms and do some online tests or something to just make sure that you dont have it. 

Why am I saying this? Because I kept denying the possibility and thought i was just ""socially awkward' due to childhood bullying. Never considered aspergers until i was 20. FRICKING 20. 20 yeras of social development i have missed coz i wasnt given any form of treatment such as social skills coaching or early intervention (which has proven to work on people with aspergers).

"I’ve already considered it and have come to the conclusion that I’m autistic, but I agree with this message. I bet so many people with autism have social anxiety as a result of being mistreated for their autism. It makes sense considering so many autistic people feel out of place, weird, or similar, and they are often bullied for being autistic, which greatly increases the risk of developing social anxiety.

One of my main forms of masking is my social anxiety. Fear is a very strong motivator, so as I got older I started masking. Started stimming less, I mostly avoided social interaction instead of working to understand social interactions, it just wasn’t worth it to me.

Interesting take. I can completely relate with your post, but at the same time I’ve accepted a lot of what you say as my personality.

I have been suspecting that I’m autistic for awhile. Someone on here even pointed it out that I could possibly be. The main problem I have with this is that it’s extremely expensive and difficult to get tested for it as an adult and woman. Other people may still be able to get a diagnosis, but for me I don’t have the option. I also don’t want to waste my parents’ money.

"i’m 20f and on the waiting list to get assessed, it’s a 2 year waiting list here though unfortunately so i’ll be 22 when i get a result but yes you are so right. look through my post history i’ve always commented on here and made posts about how out of place i feel. i’m 20f but feel stuck at 15. i’m obsessed with horror movies, which is like the only thing that brings me joy. i don’t understand social cues that well, never had any group of friends jusf found that i cling and get obsessed with one friend. i suppose there’s no need to explain the rest to prove that i potentially have it, my psychologist ran through some screening tests and sent the referral off so yeah. 

my advice to anyone who is like me waiting though is to just let it fly if that makes sense, accept that your still waiting and just let it go for now, try not to obsess too much about if you have it or not. chances are you do if a professional recommends an assessment. i was very emotional after scoring high on the screening tests as i wish this happened to me when i was younger and someone picked up on it instead of going years wondering what i’m “doing wrong” as to why i cant fit in/no one likes me.

"Yea I definitely think I am mildly on the spectrum. Have always felt like I processed things differently and simple social things like hugging, handshakes/high fives, dancing, etc. don’t come natural and I find myself having to consciously think about it. I do feel like there are a lot of quirky people out there who are mildly on the spectrum too, just in different ways that don’t manifest as social anxiety. Hell, most people might be on the spectrum. The older I get the more I wonder if normal even exists. Everyone has a touch of something I feel like- we just were the lucky ones to get social anxiety.  I feel like a lot of the funniest comedians are definitely on the spectrum. 

You’re never going to totally get rid of your social anxiety or being on the spectrum, so I think you just gotta accept this is part of you and you’re always gonna be a little awkward or whatever. And just accept that that’s fine, that it will be limiting and isn’t ideal, but you can still live a quality life. You may not be able to gel with most people but there will be some that rock with you, and that’s all you need. Life isn’t easy for any of us and we all have our own unique challenges. I’ve learned to accept myself as the kinda socially anxious/awkward dude on the spectrum and just rock it, not even try to hide it, and people either rock with me or they don’t. The fact is people don’t give af what you are or have.. all they care about is how you make them feel and if they enjoy being around you. If you have SA but they enjoy being around you, then they really couldn’t care less that you have SA or are awkward sometimes or whatever. If they do care, they’re prolly on the spectrum themselves lol."	Business_Window_6232	reply	na	na	na	0.0053628734312951565	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
I'm 40m and have been wondering this for a few years now. I feel pretty strongly that I either have both social anxiety and ASD, or I simply have ASD and have been confusing symptoms for social anxiety my entire life. With social anxiety you of course aren't supposed to practice avoidance behaviors, so my entire life I've been forcing myself into extremely uncomfortable situations. But in theory it gets easier over time with exposure. This has never been my experience. If anything it gets harder. I ran into issues with alcohol bc I found it to be the only thing to calm the anxiety. It has derailed my life in a lot of ways and although it's not helpful I can't help but wonder how different things might be if I had received an asd diagnosis growing up and adjusted my life accordingly.

i really hope you accept yourself whatever hte results are. I have so much trouble accepting my diagnosis. realising all those issues in my life could have been avoided if they just diagnosed me earlier. I know im autistic. But i am intelligent. I COULD HAVE DONE BETTER. I am hard working. I would have put in the effort as a child and applied the social skills i learned properly. I would have lived a normal life. Instead i just stayed in blissful ignorance, not knowing how far ahead my peers were going in terms of social skills development	Business_Window_6232	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0053628734312951565	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
I agree. I don't really understand why it is so important for a diagnosis as an adult. Unless you just feel better knowing I guess. It's not like there is a breakthrough medication that will be available after diagnosis. It's just therapy, which is very expensive even with insurance. I understand diagnosis could help if a person needed to be on disability, but most undiagnosed adults are not needing that level of help. In my own opinion of course. I feel like if you suspect you may have it, use some self help tools such as books, YouTube videos, helpful websites. You can learn about the condition and get some coping mechanisms and other helpful info. But if you need further help, see a therapist of course.

"i was diagnosed at age 7 and the social skills counseling i got for the first couple years did help to some extent. but then the school put me into a group counseling setting with people who were a good deal more autistic than me and it genuinely made things worse for me. i was repeatedly treated like i was basically subhuman by the teacher running it, and some of the other kids were jealous that i was more socially able and lashed out at me (one of them outed me as having autism to the entire grade and that made school more hellish for me than it already was). all the while i got zero actual help, like the teacher would usually just play a youtube video or make us do our homework. 

and when i tried to get out of autistic support because it was a fucking nightmare i was impeded at every step of the way by teachers and even my own parents (had a binder full of IEP docs thrown at my face during one argument). took until high school for it all to be over, because no help at all was genuinely better than what my school had to offer.

looking back i do wish i had some sort of counseling/therapy because i definitely needed it at the time but being thrown into a room for half an hour a week and talked to like a small child and repeatedly told shit i already knew was not the solution. ive been told i act shy/awkward but people usually suspect anxiety or adhd instead of autism so i guess im masking successfully, wish i was better at talking to people though."

"I (17M) am going into my senior year and feel like I disgust probably 90% of the girls in my class. I’m pretty awkward, and I know that’s probably a huge part of it - but it feels like they see as a physically “gross kid”. This probably stemmed from how I was my freshmen year, but I’ve changed COMPLETELY from how I was. Just for exposition : I run distance, so I’m physically active near 100% of days. A lot of the time I lift, too. Shower twice daily, exfoliates daily, moisturizing twice daily. My hygiene is one of my primary focuses when I’m home. I’m don’t think I’m THAT ugly (I guess I’d have no way of knowing, though), and my haircut is decent imo. Why do girls think I’m so gross? I’m not even really talking about dating, idrgaf abt dating anymore. I’m just talking about literally 100% platonic conversations. 

For example, earlier today this girl dropped her AirPods, and they slid below my desk. As I’m reaching down to get them, she literally almost yells, multiple times, to “ignore them” and to not touch them. I was obviously confused, but listened to her request. Later I get up to go get something and see her reach down to get the AirPods herself. Later she tries to play it off like she “didn’t want to make me bend down to get them” to avoid hurting my feelings, but it was so blatantly obvious she just didn’t want me to touch her stuff. It’s not just that, but that was one example of multiple similar instances. 

The main reason I can think of is that I still can’t drive as a senior. I know that’s rlly bad, but idk why that would make me genuinely repulsive. That or that my outfits aren’t the greatest (like jeans and sweatshirts/tshirts most days).

"People who struggle with social anxiety often think people are paying a lot more attention to them then they actually are. For example, how much time do you spend thinking about how gross other people are? I'm betting it's nearly zero, just like them. Everyone is too caught up in their own shit to have those thoughts all the time.

As for tips, make sure you're seeing women as people, and not just a potential dating/sex object, be open to having gal pals (it's not a consolation prize). Aim for being friends and make them by having similar interests, like joining clubs or sports etc.

If you get along with other guys then ask them if you can join in on any social events which have a good mix of people.

"I'd not even be putting those back into my ears, if they had ""just"" fallen on the floor.

I had to do an internship in a hospital for half a (school-)year.  
There was a nurse teaching/preparing us for that.

She used to repeatedly tell us a horror-story about how some doctor/nurse/whatever (almost?) lost their hearing from an ear-infection, they caught by using a stethoscope, that someone hadn't properly sanitized, before putting it back into the drawer.

She taught us to always sanitize everything, before it goes into our ears .. and after it comes out .. If something had fallen on the floor, it had to be properly sanitized.

And all that was in the mid to late 90's .. so covid wasn't even a thing, back then.

So, I wouldn't even have put those airpods back into my ears, even if they had just fallen below your desk .. no touching needed for it to be risky.

It’s been a long time since I was a high school girl but I can try to give you some insight. First of all the old “he’s so hot because he has a car” trope only exists in the movies. The right girl will like you with or without a license and not having a license definitely doesn’t make you “gross.” I was definitely reserved around boys at times. I was so afraid as appearing overly flirtatious and giving them the wrong impression. And sometimes interacting with guys felt so weird I’d avoid them entirely and stick to my girlfriends because it was just easier. It had nothing to do with the boys and everything to do with my own insecurities. High school is s tough time. Everyone assumes the next person knows more than them but the fact is no one knows anything. Just stick with the people who you like being around (it’s okay if that’s an all guy group) and keep your head down for one more year. The real world is so much different and so much better!

You are not gross, 100% guaranteed. If you feel that way deep down then it’s probably childhood trauma, and you will subconsciously notice things that reaffirm that belief.

"First off, as social anxiety makes us feel extra awkward it’s normal to feel like people don’t feel comfortable around you or don’t wanna deal with you. 

Secondly, as a 23F I can confirm high school is actually very different from normal society. I graduated college in December and while it wasn’t easy being around a lot of people I did realize how petty people were in high school. People just cared too much about other people. 

You seem like a cool dude to me. Just because girls seem awakes around you doesn’t mean they’re disgusted. If it makes you feel better I’m pretty, I’m adopted from Belarus. In high school I heard boys audibly say “She’s so hot but she so awkward” and it made me want to just lay on the floor and die. Just because we aren’t great at feeling comfortable around strangers or large crowds or people we care about (I’m extra awkward in front of people I want to make a good impression on) doesn’t mean people won’t put up with us. 

My advice is just try and focus on yourself, if you can get to a place where you feel comfortable with how you’re acting then who cares what people say. Who cares if someone’s quiet, makes them less annoying IMO. 

Overall high school sucks and I’m sorry we all have to go through it. I’ve never even been on a date but I still talk to men, stuff takes time. I’d rather take my time getting to know people as a friend (or even sexually) than waste my time being with someone who wants to get rid of me after a couple months.

If I notice that I've forgotten in the public, I do my best to hide it from other people that I'm around because it might be embarrassing.

"You know that feeling of dread as everyone around you talks amongst themselves laughing about the day to day. It’s not too much of a problem for me to be around people but what gets me is that no one sat next to me. I have no friends in my major but it feels so humiliating when we have such a small major and the entire group refuses to sit on my row. I wanted to cry the entire class. I know it’s my fault for not greeting anybody and not being bright and cheery after a short summer being away from school. Saying “hi” feels so difficult, the rejection just feels too painful especially when I know I’m not accepted.

The only thing stopping you from doing the thing in question is your belief that you cannot do the thing in question. Which is also a double edged sword lol. At the end of the day, exposure is simple imo. Avoid avoidances, practice relaxed demeanor, minimize rumination, and focus your attention on what you need to be doing in that moment. We always make exposure stressful by replicating past behaviors or picturing us failing in the future(I.e oh wow another day stressed by talking to people. I’ll never change). Ruminating about how you currently feel is a surefire way to ensure that you won’t change.

That’s the thing though. Social anxiety does not mean social skills. You can have great social skills and have social anxiety, and you can have terrible social skills and no social anxiety. Social anxiety is ruminating. Worried about how you’re being perceived etc. It doesn’t revolve around the quality of your social skills. Sure, ample social skills will make it easier to adjust, but overall it’s a simple matter. Your body thinks you’re fighting a saber toothed tiger instead of just having a conversation. So I beg to differ. Exposures are never guaranteed to make anxiety go away, they are simply a means to challenging yourself. But if you don’t try you will never change your behaviors. If anything, doing an exposure to show yourself that no matter how dumb you sound or how embarrassed you FEEL, you were safe. You’ve always been safe. Your body is just convinced you’re in danger	Parmesanbutt2	reply	na	na	na	0.9988068342208862	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"The whole point is the bare minimum is what matters. If you’re physically safe and no matter what happens you’re fine, everytime, how is that not empowering? Lol. It should be the number 1 driver for change. 

Which one of these forms of self talk/behaviors are more like to result in effective long term development? 

“I’ve been down road A several times. Regardless of how uncomfortable it feels I always survive, it was never actually dangerous, and my limbic system is causing my perception to be faulty. People notice things, but at the end of the day my concerns are blown out of proportion. The average person doesn’t rerun conversations they had yesterday in their head over and over again. So I will do another exposure, and allow myself to travel that road again if my brain insists, but I will do my best to practice a new viewpoint and try activating my Parasympathetic nervous system instead this time. I’ll allow the anxiety to be there, in my awareness, but I will turn my focus outwards. If it doesn’t work, no harm no foul” 

Option B: 
“I’ll never be able to change. I always get terribly anxiety when I have a conversation. They are probably realizing how much of a fool I seem like. This is terrible, I’ll be like this my whole life. I’ve been like this for so many years it would take so long to change my behaviors if I even COULD”. 


See what I mean? Option B doesn’t allow any room for growth, utilizing brain elasticity, or questioning if there’s more to life than your perception. Your brain is quite literally the most literal thing you can fathom. If you tell it you can’t stand the way you feel, you will not be able to stand the way you feel. Through practicing new dialogue and approaches you can gradually shift. Acceptance paradox my friend, if you want to change you have to accept yourself as you are now. Social anxiety and all."

Yeah, but not fine ""socially"" if you're achieving nothing, and ""fail"" at the interaction.

If you have apt proof and experience with it, and the results are clear, either A or B are valid. There are people who have such bad social skills and such awful anxiety, that they can't manfully change their behavior around these things. That's valid."

I was walking home from the gym and a man comes up from behind me to the side of me on a bike and he starts making conversation with me (as I have my airpods in) and introducing himself (and he has sunglasses on so I had no idea what he looked like) and saying I caught his eye. For some reason it genuinely made me so uncomfortable and I told him i don’t want to talk. This man approached me without even knowing what my face looked like. Luckily he went away after I said I don’t want to talk. Anyone else get uncomfortable when they’re randomly approached like this? This happens to me sometimes but this time in particular made me uncomfortable. I don’t always get uncomfortable but my fight or flight kicker in for some reason with this dude.

I think basically everyone would get uncomfortable if approached like this, you’re being approached by an overly friendly stranger who you did not initiate anything with, it feels like they want to harm you and often times they only want to sexually harass you. There’s absolutely no reason to introduce yourself to a stranger with no connection unless you want to flirt or sell them something, both of which are unappealing from randos who won’t even show their face. If someone doesn’t follow social norms in conversation, it’s valid to assume they also won’t follow social norms in flirting, respect, etc because if you’re a woman you’ve almost guaranteed been harassed by a guy like this who shows up out of no where and won’t leave you alone when you say no.	kittty-titty	reply	na	na	na	0.9987975358963013	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"I can totally relate to this, I've had so many creeps approach me on the street to the point i seem to be a creep magnet and it just really adds insult to injury when you've got social anxiety, as I just feel so uncomfortable and distressed being suddenly approached by a stranger like this whos expecting me to engage in conversation with them on the street. I've had weird men bother me like this which has been quite traumatising for me, as I also had one stop me on a bike as well by putting his hand out in front of me asking me to stop (after he'd already tried talking to me earlier at the crossing so seeing how relentless he was was most annoying!)which I annoyingly and most passively responded to, as he asked to take a photo of me. I had already had a bad day so just lost it, making a scene as i was just so distressed which i regret now as what i really should've done was just ignore him and continue walking when he tried physically stopping me with his hand. This infuriated me as its one thing to call out to someone but putting your hand in front of them!

I also have had beggars and chuggers approach me, which always makes me panic. Chuggers are annoying enough but seeing how inconsiderate they are to how people they pester may have social anxiety really makes me mad. I once even turned around as soon as one started greeting me from a distance, which may have seemed rude but i dont see why we owe them any manners and politeness when they are not being considerate of us. 

So yeah, i think strangers approaching you on the street is most infuriating when you've got social anxiety, being a total nightmare for socially anxious people and really adding insult to injury. I hate when people criticise you for being ""rude"" as you don't owe them anything, especially as they're not being considerate of your needs so why should you be polite.

Sometimes, I think it really only makes someone uncomfortable based on who is doing the approaching. Its Kinda double standard. For example, i hate small talk, but I live in a building that has a lot of older men and women, and they love small talk. It makes me uncomfortable, but I recognize there isn't something wrong with them it's more so me. I've heard many women complain about how guys don't ever approach girls anymore. For anyone wondering, this is why. If you're her type and you're a hot guy, no issues with where you approach her.  If you're not her type and ugly, you're just creepy and made her uncomfortable by doing nothing but talking. I can't help but feel if this was your gym crush approaching.

As a man, I’d say I understand how this can be creepy depending on the environment and how the approach is made however, this is very normal for a guy with interest in a girl to approach her. Again this depends on the approach but we’ve been in a world of internet dating for so long that a physical approach seems awkward . Most times it’s men that have to do the approaching and sometimes that can takes lots of courage. I would say depending on the environment and approach, this may be your future husband one day approaching you with the mindset that he’s probably never gonna see u again so why not try his luck.

Considering the fact that most women you know have been in an uncomfortable situation with a man this is completely messed up of you to say. I’ve been followed home before several times, and have been left creepy voicemails by strangers. I’ve been groped at raves, catcalled, and touched inappropriately by strangers. It’s only natural that after such experiences that I would be wary of strangers approaching me	kittty-titty	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9987975358963013	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
Whenever someone says to “look at the numbers” for stuff like this are not thinking about the bigger picture. There’s a reason those stats are low. The reason is that women are on high alert. If we weren’t, I bet you those numbers would rise. Would they rise enough to make it worth being on high alert all the time?

"Murder is just one possible negative ending for a woman interacting with a strange man whose presence made her immediately uncomfortable. There are many other negative outcomes. 

If you enjoy statistics, look up how many women are raped, look up how many disabled women are sexually assaulted, look up how many children are assaulted before turning 18, look up the backlog on rape kits that makes you feel like even reporting the rape will do nothing for justice. 

Here’s a fun one: look up how criminals later convicted for violent crimes tested positive as the rapist in a rape kit decades earlier that wasn’t processed until recently. 

Did you know the #1 cause of death for pregnant women is murder? Number one. The number one cause of death for almost every other demographic is heart disease. 

A man’s only worry is being turned down, a woman has far more to lose in the situation. No matter your participation in self defense and the stories you’ve heard, it’s impossible for you to understand what it’s like to live day to day as an animal of prey in a world full of wolves.

I will not be teaching my daughter to be polite to strange men just to save men’s feelings. I will teach her to yes be rude, be mean, be safe. And guess what? She will have no problem finding a partner. It is very easy to find a partner without approaching strangers outside."	kittty-titty	reply	na	na	na	0.9987975358963013	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"difference: people need to travel by car to get to work, feed themselves, or do almost anything in a car-dependent world. you NEVER need to speak to or trust a random man on the street. there is an insanely minuscule chance that doing that would ever benefit a woman. why the hell would i ever do that and take the chance?

i literally don’t drive myself because i’m afraid of getting in an accident, because i know it is statistically very likely to happen at some point. people ridicule me for that fear much MUCH more than they ridicule me for being afraid/cautious of strange men, because they have common sense.

also, it’s not just about being killed. i don’t just wanna not get murdered, i wanna have a peaceful walk without being sexually harassed or catcalled or creeped on. that’s not too much to ask. and that happens VERY often. i’ve never met a woman who hasn’t been harassed on the street."	kittty-titty	reply	na	na	na	0.9987975358963013	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

Just my opinion. I think it's a factor that doesn't get considered because we don't like to internalize why we feel a certain way. For example, as a big black male, it breaks my heart when women cross the street when we happen to be alone on the same street or at night. It happens quite often. But I've internalized that as it's not a personal attack on me, I need to keep doing what I do and be respectful and understanding that they do that for their own comfort. I would argue that the same goes for when a guy approaches you for a conversation, it may make you particularly feel uncomfortable, but is it actually yourself or what he is doing.	kittty-titty	reply	na	na	na	0.9987975358963013	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

It’s the way you approach a woman that you need to be mindful of. If she’s walking and by herself and you never exchanged any kind of interaction prior then I don’t think it’s your place to approach her and you should be cautious of how you’re coming across when it’s super random, or at least the words you use.

OP did the right thing to tell the guy to kindly go away and to follow her instincts, however now you are refusing to see things through the perspective of men. Being bad isn’t a one-sided gender aspect, rather than instead, it is a human aspect. Girls can be just as bad as men, but just because they can be doesn’t mean that all females are bad. There are good women out there too, just as good men can exist. Are we going to disregard the fact that other cases have occurred that involved married girls trying to poison their husbands with adding bleach in their beverages or abusing their partners, having sexual relations with minors and children in school, or straight up murdering people in general? Sure maybe it’s unheard of, but that does not mean that it hasn’t happened. Men can be victims too. False accusers are common and the situation between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp proved that. False accusations can cause a loss of a job, loss of family and friends, a loss of reputation, and a loss of willingness to live after losing everything. It takes many years to build a reputation and foundation, but it only takes seconds to lose all that. Now I don’t agree that the guy in OP’s situation should’ve worn sunglasses, as he should’ve taken a more open and friendlier approach, but the fact that he respected OP’s wishes and went away, goes to show that human decency and respect still exists. Some guys/boys may not follow that motto, but the ones that do should prove to you that there are at least decent men that exist. We cannot let our emotions cloud our judgment and immediately judge someone before getting to know them. Would it be fair if I immediately said how all women are bad because of observations, stories and experiences I’ve read, and my own experiences? Or would it be fair to tell my sons to avoid girls because of past experiences and their own statistics of crimes? No it wouldn’t. There are 7 billion people on this planet and we cannot all generalize a gender. Being bad is a human trait and there are still good humans that exist. I’m sure you must have wonderful and respectful guy friends in your life and their existence should prove that there could be great men that exist.	kittty-titty	reply	na	na	na	0.9987975358963013	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"Basically, I noticed I'm always trying to please people and I avoid confrontation a lot. I was talking to my therapist and he asked me what was the first time I remember feeling rejected.

I then remembered something that I never forgot but never thought that it would be that big: when I was about 9 to 10 years old, our teacher straight up asked the whole class who they thought was the most annoying kid in class. Everyone pointed at me and started saying my name. I tried to play it cool at the time but when everyone went on a break between classes, I stayed in the classroom crying, and crying a lot. I remember the teacher and principal had to call my mom to come pick me up and they explained the situation to her. I don't remember if she was angry at them for it, that's all I remember.

I really don't know why they thought I was the most annoying kid, but I seem to have a small level of autism, so I might have been ""weird"" and kinda hyperactive.

Awesome that you have this insight and that you can see how much that time affected you. Its good to be aware of those things.

 I have a theory about when people 'just find this person annoying' - the person they find annoying can see through their bullshit in some way.

"I quit drinking in 2020 for a lot of reasons, but one of the biggest was the shameovers.  Every time I drank, I’d wake up so ashamed of myself and embarrassed for being out in public in the morning that it would take me days to reregulate. 

Now it happens without alcohol too so yay me. I’m currently awake and teary because I went to a business networking event last night and it was awful. My awkwardness isn’t of the “shrink into the shadows and say nothing” variety, unfortunately.  It’s of the “can’t think, filter shut off, babble enthusiastically and somewhat inappropriately” variety.

So, basically, I’m dying of cringe and crying in bed because I did this networking thing last night.  

I’m 40 and this is ridiculous - I feel like I’m socially/emotionally trapped at somewhere around 12 years old. Haven’t had any luck with therapy over many many years and with many many therapists - the last one I had in person fired me when I wasn’t improving after two years and most of them don’t last that long before they tell me they aren’t equipped to help me. There’s a huge shortage of decent mental health providers where I live and there aren’t other cities closer than 3-4 hours away to go shopping around. Had the online therapists all dump me within two sessions and I quit trying that after the sixth one. Meds have worked for the anxiety and panic attacks, but always come with strong and persistent side effects that necessitate coming off the meds after a while (think months/years, not days/weeks - these are long term side effects and not the initial ones that go away) and the anxiety/shame always comes back. I don’t particularly want to go back to feeling like dirt ALL the time and sleeping all day because of SSRI lethargy or cognitive impairment from mood stabilizers in lieu of feeling like dirt for a couple days after I socialize.

Anyway - does anyone get these overwhelming feelings of shame and crying fits after social activities? What causes that? It feels like it’s a trauma response and like a sudden onset of major depression symptoms just hits me all at once and it usually takes days to feel normalish again. What can I do to speed that up?

My official diagnoses are CPTSD and anxiety, and there’s been a lot of talk about autism from therapists/psychologists in the last several years but no proper formal assessment for it.

They were all having fun and posing and even though I had fun, I felt weirded out because of my hand shaking. Like why does it happen to me?

Yes, all the time. My hands shaking was actually one of the first times I realized maybe this is more of a problem than I had thought. I remember in Highschool I volunteered to draw something on the whiteboard, I didn't think I was at all anxious. But suddenly my hand started shaking and it was so bad bc the whole class was watching. The annoying thing is that when you notice it, it makes it worse.

"So I quit my last job about five months ago due to work place bullying and have been working a couple remote side gigs to get by but now I’m being forced to return to warehousing(the only job I can get basically) because I need to pay more rent

Now I have zero problems with working but the people make it absolutely unbearable, warehousing can be boring so your coworkers expect you to entertain them and talk and talk for the entire shift and even on your breaks and if you don’t you’re singled out and labeled as a weirdo immediately and started getting treated like trash.

"On one hand you have people born with conventionally attractive appearance and blessed with being neurotypical (non-autistic). Socialising is as easy and involuntary, natural and amazing as breathing. 

Then you have people like me who were born both conventionally unattractive and cursed with mild autism.

Too ""normal"" to be autistic and too ""autistic"" to be normal. 

Ive started to accept myself much more after realising that it wasnt my fault. It was never my fault. If i was born neurotypical i would have lived an amazing life. And if was also conventionally attractive on top of that it would have been even easier.

"So I was with my friend, we were sitting, waiting for our turn for picture taking; three of us are the only one's left, the other is a guy. 

He looked familiar so I asked him what course he took and as well as his schedule, got an answer that he took the same course as mine. I only nodded, then my friend pointed at me and said ""So both of you are going to be blockmates"".

""I don't want to be your blockmate"". He replied with a smile. Can't remember what I replied but I just went with the conversation. 

It stung so hard. I have been dealing with self hate (as well as S thoughts) with all my high school years, up to this day. And hearing this from someone I will be going to spend my semester really got me. It doesn't sound like he's trying to crack a joke either, probably why the impact's so hard. 

I am aware that I shouldn't dwell on it, but I was thinking that this will extremely affect my academic performance no matter how hard I try to get it out of my head.

Also, when I’ve tried to make jokes with other people, sometimes it comes out weird/wrong due to my social anxiety, so there’s that.  

Hell, he could find you attractive and was nervous. People often say some very dumb shit around someone we find cute or whatever.  

My point is, there’s just no way to know what was going on in his head for sure.

Get the courage to talk to someone > it goes great and we hit it off > we talk for a few days > boom. Ghosted.

"Why talk if it might mess up our relationships? Might as well stay safe. At least we can maintain some semblance of good relation with the people we care about.

But what's the fun in that? Staying mute for life is obviously not the play

It's definitely difficult to make conversation when people dont give much to work with. Which goes both ways. Which means in order to make sure our conversations flows well, we shouldn't rely on others to make it easy for us.

There's a technique popular streamers use all the time. Why it works: it engages everyone's imagination and brings people together through story where it's not too serious. Having fun is key so that it doesn't come off as try hard and cringe. flex your listening skills to go beyond the literal

The technique I call ""Domain Expansion"": We need to get good at coming up with fun and engaging frames based on context. What frames? It's twisting the obvious/literal to make it absurd in a silly way, inviting the other to engage in roleplay. Setting the frame of the conversation can be then followed up with some ""if this is true,  what else is true?"" There are different tiers of roleplay; adjust accordingly to how close you are with your friend. Or prepare for some awkward

Practicing in front of a mirror should help to lower the stakes. Explore different routes. What should you say when you fail or say something stupid? Get inspired. Though nothing compares to getting down and dirty on the battlefield

Of course there can be other ways to spice up conversation, but having a solid fallback does make it soo much more comforting. Confidence up, performance up.

almost every shift theres a customer whos a complete asshole to me or someone else. i just want to scream at the person to fuck off but i have to act nice anyway. and on the flipside theres always a really talkative customer and theyre usually nice but i just wont be able to keep up with the conversation and i end up seeming unfriendly. like i want to talk but my attention is split between so many things that its hard to do. and the worst thing is i can hear that on all the lanes next to me people are not struggling with these situations like i am. it just reveals to me how completely socially inept i am. ill end most shifts thinking about killing/severely harming myself. 

and im also failing to get to know my coworkers. i want to talk to them but my brain is always telling me that they dont want anything to do with me. like if it's a slow shift and everyones just standing in a circle behind the registers talking ill be unable to walk over there. ill think that they dont want me there for one reason or another. and its not helping that i overheard one of the shift leaders talking shit about me behind my back once.

I ended up calming down, I didn't talk much but everyone seems really nice and the job seems really relaxed etc so I'm excited to start! Thank you"	KosmicDoll	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9994352459907532	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"Why does quietness or social awkwardness make people so uncomfortable? 

I feel like a leper or pariah. 

Everyone eventually ends up disliking me or thinking I’m weird. 

Even if they are super nice and friendly to begin with. They always pick up on my anxiety and alien behavior. Il

I’ve managed to alienate all my coworkers in a matter of weeks. I don’t know how one person can be so unlikeable. 

People (especially other girls) get so uncomfortable around me and they think I’m naive or mentally delayed. People are afraid to swear around me and think I’m devoutly religious for some reason. 

I also have a British accent and grew up attending sheltered religious private schools. So this likely impacted my social development and made me overly formal, deferential, and reserved."	Ifeelsadtodayyy	post	25.606684327812577	female	White	0.9992653727531433	na	na	na	17	socialanxiety
"When I feel judged, I often repeat in my head ""I am confident"", or ""I'am not afraid"". Repeat sentences in your brain that will make you feel better even If you subconsciously dont believe them.

And you don't have to be likeable, those people are either being judgmental or you are just overthinking.

I know, everyone thinks I’m a freak too. I’m fifteen and throughout my life, my personality has remained consistent. I have always felt isolated and overlooked, with few people paying attention to me. Initially, I believed this was due to my perceived lack of attractiveness, but I soon realized that wasn't the true cause. My social skills have always been subpar, and they worsened  after enduring severe bullying at my previous school last year. I’m in a new school now. I’ve been in an all-girls school all my life. These girls have known each another for over three years. The inability to form new friendships and the feeling of emptiness weigh heavily on me. Witnessing others enjoy loud laughter with their friends only amplifies my anxiety. People often shoot me dirty looks and find me peculiar because I don't conform to societal norms. Like, Is it abnormal to enjoy reading book while everyone in class is loudly talking to one another? As a fifteen-year-old, adults assure me that life will improve after I graduate from school. However, I remain unsure of what exactly is wrong with me. I have a good heart, achieve decent grades, strangers compliment me from time to time and am incredibly generous. So why do others treat me as an outsider? This feeling is so prevalent in school, where long-established friendships exclude me. Sometimes, even strangers seem to do the same. Perhaps it's because I struggle to engage with people and have horrible social anxiety-I am undeniably a terrible conversationalist.

I can totally relate to your struggle, especially in my early days. What has helped me address my anxiety is talking to a therapist, practicing social exercises, knowing what my triggers are, preparing conversations in advance, getting a good night's sleep always, limiting caffeine, and exploring how I view the world and why.

"Same. Some of the senior employees have been pointing out what a great job I’m doing. And it’s only because I spend 100 percent of my time working and avoid office socializing lol. 

It makes me feel really good about myself tbh. But it alienates me even more from my coworkers. 

This one woman in particular seems to hate me even more, since me overworking makes her look lazy in comparison. She talks so much trash behind my back when I’m nothing but nice to her. 

The only time she speaks to me is to say “you don’t need to work so hard, the lawyers don’t even notice or appreciate it (we are paralegals)”. Which isn’t true, since many of them have approached me personally to point out how efficient my work has been and helpful I’m being (I’m new at this job, but I have been going above and beyond to avoid getting fired or pushed out by not being a “cultural fit”).  She tries to encourage me to do less work constantly lol. But then she is extremely harsh and critical of any mistake I make and tries to embarrass me in front of coworkers

The only way to avoid getting kicked out of jobs is for me to get on the good side of management and show my work adds value. Cause I can’t win people over by being funny and likable or social. My coworkers dislike me more every day and they resent me for actually doing my job and not sitting there socializing. Not like they try to include me anymore, most of them think I’m extremely boring or childlike and weird.

I was just prescribed this for my social physical anxiety. Is it enough to help? I've seen other people on here saying 40 is better. Just curious if anyone else finds 20 effective.

It's important to take the starter dosages to see how your body reacts to it. I found that class of medicine made me dizzy, even at low dosages.

"I joined a running group (+- 20 people) to try and make some friends. But since joining I've had the worst social anxiety of my life, and after 4 months it still hadn't gone away. I then started to notice strange behaviour from people. Some would walk away when I joined their conversation. Some people would nitpick my form/performace and make me feel stupid. They would avoid running or standing next to me. The only friends I've made are other new members. 

Last night we all went out for drinks and my new friend and I tried to join a table where some other people I've talked to a bit were sitting. I didn't think I was being awkward, I joined in the conversation and tried to get to know people a bit better. But 15 minutes later everyone but my friend and I had gotten up and left the table. When I looked around, they had all shifted to a different table... without us. It made me feel so awful and like a complete loser. It confirmed what I was afraid of, that they just don't want me/us part of their group. "	meiseivanmaasdorp	post	23.79313656487469	female	White	0.999484658241272	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety

Hi! I’m 23 years old and i feel like I’ve lived with anxiety for so long it’s starting to become a regular part of my life. I had a panic attack the other day just driving in my car, my heart was beating out of my chest and my skin started to get blotchy. I find it hard leaving the house most of the time alone, even if it’s just going to the supermarket. Sometimes I even avoid going places where I might have to speak to someone. I haven’t even filled up my car with fuel on my own yet. My anxiety makes it hard for me to reach out for help as even phone calls are hard for me. Some days are better than others though. i used to take anti depressants but before I got better, they made me feel worse and I ended up in hospital and lost my job, so I’m terrified to start medication again as I don’t live at home anymore and losing my job would make things a lot worse. I’m just lost at what I should do now so I guess I’m looking for advice.	LilKeeli	post	29.665057670344453	male	White	0.9959830045700073	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety
You have a lot of big things that are stressing you out. Talking to someone at a store is honestly huge for social anxiety. So I think it’d help to work on the smallest thing you can think of and try to get comfortable with that small thing. Still cope however you do with big things that are unavoidable, but try to push yourself in small ways that don’t freak you out a ton. For some people that might be just stepping outside on their porch and going back inside and practicing that. For others it might be going for a full walk or even going to the store. But focus on that one thing and don’t try too much at once, keep it at a level that isn’t overly upsetting.	LilKeeli	reply	na	na	na	0.9959830045700073	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

You have nothing to be sorry about. One of the best ways to overcome anxiety is to go to resources outside of your social group/family and get some feed back. it's not what people think about you but what you think about yourself that truly matters. Keep socializing and puting yourself out of your comfort zone the rest will follow. Cheers!	See2paper	reply	na	na	na	0.9988085031509399	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"Title basically says it all. I actually conquered one of my fears today and went to a work happy hour. I have worked at my job for almost a year now and this is the first one I’ve went to, since I usually make up an excuse to avoid them, as they give me so much anxiety. I am a recent college grad and the youngest on my team by far. This makes it super hard to talk to people/relate to them on a lot of things, especially since all my coworkers are married and have kids. 

While I am proud of myself for even attending, I can’t help but feel bad about how awkward I was. I said max maybe 20 words the entire time…even the alcohol couldn’t make me less shy. I mostly just smiled and/or quietly laughed at things other people were saying. People ignored me for the most part, but the couple times someone did ask me something, I feel like it was just out of pity. I did my best to hold up a conversation if someone talked to me, but just kept falling flat :( ugh. This is exactly why I don’t go to these things. I honestly probably never will again. I also left after an hour, I was the first one to go. When I was leaving, I said goodbye to everyone and literally only one person, my manager, bless her heart, said goodbye. Now I’m convinced that everyone hates me. Once again I feel like I’m going to be labeled in everyone’s minds as the shy awkward girl, a label I cannot escape for the life of me.

"I remember the few times I pushed myself and tried to “put myself out there” by going to a party or going on a date. 

100 percent all awful and regretful experiences. I regret the vast majority of parties and social events I attend. It just highlights how awkward and stiff and fridgid I am. And then everyone thinks I’m sanctimonious or super religious for not drinking alcohol. It’s actually embarrassing that adults get so judgmental about people not drinking. I also have people ask me why I never swear ot cuss. An these are OLD people, not teenagers trying to be cool. Yet somehow I’m the weird, boring one. 

I always thought it’s more acceptable for a girl to ve quiet. But I don’t think it’s the case. Girls at work are actually expected to be more bubbly and smiley and outgoing. And reserved men are not judged as harshly as me. Most people find me boring and odd or rude & arrogant or standoffish. I even get called weird and boring to my face. 

The most traumatizing was this one guy in my college accounting class asked me out (we were group partners and I made him laugh and I think he found my shyness endearing or something cause he was wayyy out of my league). I was so intimidated by him and found him really tall and cute. 

I kept refusing his invitations or making excuses, and I finally said yes. And my fears were confimed. I went to get dinner with him and he realized what an absolute freak I am, how I have no friends or any social media accounts (red flag to normal people), and how I can’t communicate like a human. It’s like why put myself out there when the MORE people get to know me, the more they dislike me or find me weird and alien-like lol. 

It’s incredibly hurtful for one girl to face so much rejection. I have no friends or a boyfriend. I feel like such a freak at work and can’t participate in basic conversations with coworkers. Where they talk about their families, friends, husbands, boyfriends, kids, weekend plans, etc.

Generally people don't respond to someone's awkwardness because they don't want to make it worse. Your coworkers don't hate you, they don't know you. When you don't know what to do, you tend to do nothing. It sounds like there was too much pressure and it was hard to be interested in what was happening. It helps to remember that an interested person is in fact interesting. Just asking simple questions is great when you don't have anything to share. Let the pressure off too, be proud you went. Also, alcohol tends to make anxiety worse for a lot of people. Lastly, a mixer style hangout is much more difficult than other forms of breaking the ice, so a simpler activity that everyone focuses on (like bowling or hiking) makes mingling a lot easier since you're focusing on something else other than each other.	carnations2000	reply	na	na	na	0.9993498921394348	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety

I really relate to a lot of what you said. I always feel very different from other people, very awkward and stiff and frigid, just like you put it. Also what you said about being a quiet woman is very true. I feel like many times women are expected to be bubbly and outgoing, and many people don’t think it’s nearly as weird when men are quiet. I’m sorry that you’re having these experiences, it really sucks to always feel like the weird one in the room. Especially when you try so hard to go out of your comfort zone and always fail at it.

began college this week. both of my classes so far have a lot of speaking, ice breakers, introducing yourself, getting called on, i’d assume presentations etc. i want to run away. did anyone else get used to this? i don’t want to do my assignments, i don’t want to go back tomorrow. feel like i’m not built for this. my heart beats so fast and my arms feel like jello. i feel so uncomfortable in class. i understand exposure, but i still felt like this after being in classes for months when i was in high school. i want to go to the school counselor but is that their job or would i be over sharing personal details with them? will they tell my parents why i was there?

In the same boat with ya :’) school counselors are there to help you deal with obstacles in the way of you reaching your goals as a student. I say go to the counselor and explain your concerns about your social anxiety affecting your academics. Even if they end up not able to help you directly deal with your social anxiety, they can guide you to other school resources that can. Also, I don’t think they’ll tell your parents. College (or at least mine) is different than HS in the way that you are fully responsible for yourself now as an adult. My school doesn’t even allow the release of medical or academic records to anyone else besides the student without a written form.

VERY interesting movie.  In the beginning, I think the dude has a little social anxiety, but the rest of the movie is basically him living through the absolute worst case scenarios followed by his friends being jerks to him on his birthday.

You can feel the uncomfortableness so much in this movie and whilst I didn't know what comedy horror was before....that's exactly the genre that this movie falls into.  The ""horror"" part is not ghosts or shit that scares you as people typically think, but mental horrors...situational horrors mentally.

"Yea its totally possible. There are varying degrees of social anxiety, from mild to the full blown personality disorder. Social anxiety is something every person experiences, but it is not debilitating for everyone. How negatively it impacts your life determines the level of the diagnosis. 

For example, if someone is having anxiety over public speaking/giving a speech or singing karaoke, it does not necessarily mean they have a disorder. It is normal for everyone to feel some
social anxiety and stress when giving a speech, even people who do it professionally. 

Now if those activities cause you so much distress you get sick, or have to avoid them altogether to where it affects other areas of your life, then you *may* be closer to having a disorder. 

I think you should talk to your doctor about the twitching/tics. You may have an underlying health condition that becomes noticeable when under stress."	Vegetable_Sundae_688	reply	na	na	na	0.9931384921073914	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"If you struggle with social anxiety, I recommend learning a new language and/or immersing yourself in a new culture. Hear me out: 

When you're learning a new language, nobody expects you to know any of the intricacies of social interaction in that language. You can stumble over your words all you want, come up blank and forget words, mispronounce things, use bad grammar, be inadvertently rude, be awkward, etc. People will expect this from you. You will smile and laugh with other people as you make mistake after mistake, and they will correct you.

Let's say that you have social anxiety and you live in the US and speak English. Now imagine that you have started learning Spanish online, and eventually you start taking lessons with a tutor on iTalki. Your tutor is a patient, kind, charismatic, understanding person from Columbia who speaks English and Spanish, and they use iTalki as a side hustle while they work as a lawyer. They charge $8 an hour to have 1-on-1 casual conversations with you, to improve your Spanish-speaking skills. They teach you how to interact with people in Spanish and they provide endless encouragement. 

If all of this seems oddly specific, it's because it's my personal experience. I started learning Spanish and practiced with tutors on iTalki. I ended up getting two separate seasonal jobs in Spanish-speaking countries, traveling abroad, and making new friends. I found that people abroad were always eager to teach me their language and culture, which was a revelation, because I wish I had that kind of friendly tutelage as an American in America. I noticed that when I was abroad, speaking in Spanish, I was more expressive, had a bubblier personality, I smiled more, and I was much more confident (even though my Spanish still kinda sucks). Learning Spanish helped me to navigate through my social anxiety and get me out of my shell."	gwkt	post	29.184180812902227	female	White	0.0012645977549254894	na	na	na	5	socialanxiety
"That's an interesting perspective, showing that social anxiety comes in many forms and different solutions may work for different people.

Unfortunately, for many people with social anxiety, the necessity to communicate in a foreign language feels really painful.

English is the only foreign language I know and I managed to learn it to a somewhat advanced level only because it's so common and extremely useful, but still I remember the beginner and intermediate stages of learning as a traumatic experience, and I'm thankful I progressed beyond them many years ago. Nevertheless, when I have to talk to someone in English, my social anxiety still gets elevated at least ten times higher that when I use my native language. That's because:

- I'm hyperaware of all my mistakes.
- I'm afraid of being misunderstood and making an involuntary faux pas.
- I'm worried about missing some important parts of the spoken message and social cues, which can lead to even more misunderstanding.
- The feeling of inferiority and asymmetry while communicating with a native speaker hits hard, even if I know the other person behaves very friendly and these unpleasant feelings and thoughts are only an illusion created by my brain.

"I’m 24f 2020 college grad.

I’ve hopscotched jobs for roughly 4 years now due to my social anxiety and OCD. In college it was so bad I developed agoraphobia, and would purposely miss class which inevitably affected my grades. Now I’m at my 3rd job post grad in 3 years. 

Recently, I started getting aggressive with my desire to manage my social anxiety due to the pressures of growing up and needing to provide for myself and do normal adult things like grocery shopping. So I got a therapist last year and psychiatrist last month, and in the process also learned I have ADHD. My therapist helped me understand that some of my thoughts may be irrational regarding how people will receive or perceive me and that I should try to push myself to go out of my comfort zone and talk to people at my job. 

I’ve been working at my job for about 6 months now and don’t attend any company functions or talk to people in the office. When I attempt to I get stared at like a weirdo and people try to avoid me or get up when I sit down in the lounge and go. This is quite painful. It gets me back into the mindset that I’m the problem and should just hide away to make everyone else’s life better. I want to believe I’m thinking irrationally, but its hard when the “irrational” thoughts you have about yourself and others are personified through their reactions of/interactions/with you.

I don’t think they are inherently mean or bad people. I just feel like the have and understanding of who they think I am, and there is no changing that so I feel defeated."	Potential_Still4363	post	27.28086137034768	female	White	0.9941322207450867	na	na	na	7	socialanxiety

Hey, Also 24, and also a 2020 grad Unforutnately, what a year... ughh. I just wanted to reply because I really resonated with this because I've dealt with this exact situation before. I really do know how you feel, it's a horrible feeling and I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this. I had the same situation in my last job, I tried making friends but it always seemed like an inconvenience to them, like they were doing it because they felt they had too, and it never went more than surface level. I remember my therapist telling me to test it, so I did, when I was offered for lunch I'd accept and they'd conveniently change plans at the last minute, kept happening over and over again until I just stopped trying. Wanting to open up is hard but some people just don't give you the chance to try. The truth is cliques form very quickly and trying to become part of a group when they don't want anyone else is almost impossible, best you can usually get is an acquaintance. Burn out can easily happen when pushing to try to make friends when they don't want the same thing. I really do hope you can find someone willing to put just as much effort as you are into making a friendship, even if its outside of the workplace, does make life a little easier when you can talk to somone and unwind. It's hard work but you're doing great just to keep going!

"I like to separate this kind of thing in two categories (technically three but the third one you can’t be aware of by definition, so hey, that’s fun.). Irrational, Arational, and delusional, but that one we aren’t going to touch on, because you wouldn’t know if you were, but it’s at least good to be aware of its existence.

Irrational thinking is when your rational thinking goes a bit off the rails, that can be for a lot of reasons, maybe you exaggerate the importance of a piece of evidence, maybe you are reacting to things which happened in your past, etc, etc, what’s annoying about irrational thinking is that since it originates from reason you tend to think everything you’re thinking as mostly rational or at the very least a reasonable assumption. The lack of insight can make this a bit difficult to work with, so you will probably need someone else to help you out to figure if you are irrational or not, the advantage though is that you have access to the flexibility of rationality, you can reassess, you can pull back judgement and keep that skepticism going even if it’s hard.

Arational thinking on the other hand is thinking which is entirely separate from reason, it’s not irrational, because you can be 100% rationally aware of your train of thought to be utter nonsense but also still completely believe in it. Perception is the center of belief, it’s not doubtful and flexible like rationale is, it’s simply, i see, i feel, so i believe. Rationality has nothing to do with it and as a result it’s not possible to just logic a way out of it, the sheer rigidity of perception is what is annoying about it, you can’t just unsee something if you see it. Either you do the arduous work of changing perception or you try to manage and work on the feelings that surround it but neither is easy. The advantage that you have is that your rationale should be in good working order (though perception tends to influence rationale quite a bit) allowing you to have a good amount of insight, make decisions in spite of what perception tells you, etc. What is absolutely *critical* with this is that you do not start to think what your perception is telling you because if your logic starts to feed on the dysfunctional perception then it’s when shit really hits the fan.

By the way, i’m not saying if your thinking is rational or not here, i don’t have enough info to say anything on that.

"""I'm too obvious"". My coworker at work brought this up to me nonchalantly as we were talking and I was like what do you mean? And he says ""I can predict everything about you. The shit you say, the shit you do"". He wasn't joking, and I knew it was true. And he didn't even say it to bring me down or anything, he just casually mentioned it in a talk.

I've got thickish skin after working manual labor for so long but this actually stung. Because I knew it was true, and subliminally I've known for a long time that this was the case but I never fully realized it, my entire social identity is basically an NPC with programmed responses, which are composed of conversations I've had millions of times before and a complete inability to freestyle conversation and think on my feet.
All my responses are basically rehearsed, I rarely speak a sentence I haven't already spoken, the conversations are always more or less prefabricated.

Anyways I have no idea how to fix it and act like a normal person I've been working out taking up hobbies and trying to be a better person in general so I'll be a more interesting person but who you are inside doesn't matter if you can't express that outwardly to the people around you. I think it might be related to the fact that I've had depression and social anxiety since I was like 13 and rarely spoke to anybody without being required to, not for lack of trying just not knowing how to.

I absolutely NEVER know how to start conversation with people, and I hate small talk because of it. If I was to get lucky enough to have an opportunity to get into a deep convo w/ someone about a topic i'm passionate about I'd be fine. However, my hobbies are limited at the moment so I need to work on finding things that I like that I could have a chance to spark conversation with someone about.

"I find it so easy to talk to strangers just because it’s the same topics you talk about and no one realizes. Where they live, where they grew up, hobbies, job, pets, etc.

At my job we talk about the same topics over and over again and no one minds. “Thanks for getting that report in” “this is my second coffee” “what did you do this weekend” “anything good on tv” “sports go sports.”

I don’t think you’re weird for talking about the same things because everyone does it. Maybe you can find cool things to bring up at work before you go in?

"I can relate, I have always had social anxiety and I also began having depression around the age of 13. I do not have any real hobbies and in my spare time I mostly watch YouTube. 

I have also experienced only saying things in conversation that are predictable. However, I have also noticed that extroverted people do it too out of routine habit, but they are also able to think on their feet. 

I think for me it's because I have a heavy social filter on my thoughts and what I say. I think in order to have more personality we should work on minimizing the filter and saying whatever random thought we have.

One thing I've learned is to reserve my emotional energy for those who are a good investment.  If I trust someone and like them, they will see the deeper sides of myself.  Everyone else, like casual coworkers, gets lame canned responses and lots of smiling and nodding.  Maybe it's a bit disingenuous, but there's nothing wrong with that.

If this is due to being anxious in social settings and feeling it is not safe to express yourself spontaneously and naturally in front of others (for fear of judgment), of course your behavioral repertoire will be relatively limited and inflexible, and you will often be slower in your responses (since you're probably overthinking how to carry them out). This makes you more predictable (and also makes life more predictable for you in many ways, which reduces your anxiety). However, this is unlikely to be a reflection of your intelligence, fluidity of thought, mental flexibility, or anything like that. You're just nervous and have less practice than others chatting and interacting with people because of many years of (very understandable) avoidance.

When I realised ""not everyone has to like me"" I could then start talking about the stuff I wanted to talk about and share my real opinion, if they responded then great we are about to have a wonderful conversation. If not, then that's fine too, we are just not on the same wave length and that's fine.

In sales I have to understand that my personality doesn't mix well with everyone, my style gets clients x to respond positively, but client y hates it. I pass client y to a colleague who might be better suited.

"Social skillers are really a skill. Try to pay attention to the conversations of other people and pick up on some phrases here and there. That said, do NOT assume that people don't like you because of your SAD or depression.

One of the best things you can do for yourself in terms of getting rid of habits like overthinking or mindreading (i.e. thinking about what other people might be thinking about you) is by engaging with the topic of forgiveness and forgetting. Learn that many people forgive and forget, or just forgive, or just forget. You could annoy somebody one minute, but five minutes later, they think you're cool. A trait of many poeple with SAD (myself included) is to assume that any faux-pas carries eternal damnation with it. It doesn't. Everybody makes mistakes, but we amplify ours because of our SAD. 

You are NOT an NPC, and you are NOT obvious. Anybody who refers to other people as NPCs or obvious is usually a clown who thinks they're better than everybody else. They think other people don't have thoughts, feelings, interests or hobbies just because they give ""predictable answers"" during short talk. So what? Every single person has phrases that they typically repeat. OP, and everybody else who has been accused of being an ""NPC"", do not take these comments to heart. Nobody is in a context for gathering the most conversation starters or responses or whatever. The key in overcoming SAD is to learn to be more comfortable with conversing. Once you become more comfortable and less self-conscious, it will be easier for you to engage in more free-flowing conversation, but always bear in mind that often, your perception of what is free-flowing is marred by the grey-tinted glasses of SAD. I've often felt like I contributed basically nothing to a conversation and that I have no interesting outward attributes, until I was told by others that I seemed perfectly normal and interesting, like any other person. What I thought was stilted conversation on my part, was actually normal to everybody else. What many SAD people believe a ""free-flowing"" conversation really sounds like, is basically a Hollywood script.

If you record a ""normal"" conversation and compare that to a TV show or movie, you'll realize ""hey, conversations aren't that free-flowing or stylish as I thought they were"". Awkward pauses, interruptions, using the same phrases over and over again, these are all hallmarks of standard conversations.

"I think you should talk more from the first thought and progressively talk more open. You know when someone tells you something or you you get to talk your opinion of something you see and you have first thought and then you go over that thought and modify it to sound more plausable. Well, talk and act spontanious, on the first thought. Yeah, there will be times where you will get to think before you say something but when are with your friends or family you can absolutely be more spontanious and sincere. Over time you will feel less npc and more real since you will be able to express your personality and style you developed by being spontanious. In the end, npcs are people that do things by pattern and thats why they are ""predictable"". Breaking the pattern is just trying new things and behaviour for the sake of curiosity, not changing.

true but that defeats the purpose of getting over social anxiety because you already know or like them. at that point it's just having a conversation with someone you know. small talk is most effective when it opens you up to people you don't know as long as you can keep it from being awkward or forced.

"i was supposed to leave to go back to school earlier, but that isn’t happening since i’m writing this post. i can’t go back to school without having a massive panic attack, crying, and begging my mom to not go back. i had one of these panic attacks earlier, lashed out at family members, and my mom got so frustrated with me that now we aren’t leaving until later tonight or early tomorrow. i’m honestly not sure what to do. i want to look forward to college. i want to finish my degree and go to law school. i want to enjoy my last two years at my current school to makeup the nightmare my first two years were. i want there to be a day where i go back to college after a long break and i am so excited about it. 

to sum up, i have a disability that affects processing auditory stimuli and information, making socializing extremely difficult. i also play a division 1 sport, so i already have a solid group of “friends” and social events to attend. no problem, right? first week of college, and i end up having panic attacks at these social events because it was so overwhelming with the large amount of people and loud background noise. i couldn’t understand what anyone was saying, which caused me to flee the events early. i confided in someone who i thought was a friend about my disability and how it affected me at these gatherings. she never responded to my message, but she ended up telling her friends about what i told her calling it “awkward” and “weird.” since she’s the ringleader among my class, it’s affected my place in the social dynamic of this group and i haven’t felt fully safe since then. i also haven’t reported it to my coaches because i’m one of the weaker ones among my team, and this girl has been winning competitions for us. this hasn’t been helpful at all since i feel like i can’t fully trust anyone on the team because they’re all friends with her.
 
i’m thinking about leaving this team, as i have an injury that will take me out for the remainder of this year with the rehabilitation process. however, i’m not sure how i will make friends if i leave. i almost feel trapped. i have two friends outside of the team that i made in classes, but i’m not sure if making friends in classes will be as easy as it seems. i’m scared of the uncertainty this year will bring for me, and i’m terrified of how i will go forward with my anxiety.  

if anyone has any advice or kind words to say, i’d greatly appreciate it. i feel awful for being mean to my family because of my own problems, and i’m frustrated that i haven’t gotten over this."	cottoncandyskiesss	post	21.571300717862645	female	White	0.999090313911438	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety

"I always sit at home because I love to, and often I rejected the offers, but rarely I do go out. Recently when I went out with a few close friends and a few more people that I knew, I was completely silent and couldn’t join any conversation, I couldn’t think of a single thing to talk about, everyone was having fun but not me, it felt like I can’t talk normally anymore even with my closest friends. One girl in the group even asked me why am I so sad, and I answered that I was really bored.

So, fast forward to today, my friend asked me to hangout for the first time in like a month (because of how often i reject), and i asked how many people will be there, and he named like 8 people from which i didn’t knew half. I once again rejected the offer, but this time it was  because of how unsociable i became and I’m scared to meet new people, because i know that once again i will be like a walking statue that can’t talk. And after i told him that i wont go he called me a bastard (not exactly that since it’s hard to translate from another language the meaning) because of how much i reject. 

I don’t know what to do, I always had social anxiety but it got so bad because i love to stay at home. Back then i could stay at home but still be sociable with my friends when i went out with them, but now i feel happier alone at home than with them. it’s like there is no point of going out if i am unsociable and don’t have a single bit of fun. But because of that i can eventually lose my only friends, it’s like a loop i’m trapped in.

I’m sorry if it’s hard too understand what i’m trying to say, i tried really hard and it took me like an hour and a half to type this"	Awe_Moon	post	10.107391102012372	male	White	0.9993959665298462	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety
I've actually felt similarly over the past few years. I remember back when I was in my teens to 20s, I could have fun going out with friends (even though I did have social anxiety with people who I was not that close with) but nowadays I don't even find pleasure in hanging out with friends and would prefer to stay home alone. I've done a bit of research on this recently because I'm getting very depressed over this situation and I think there are a few steps that need to be taken in order to fix this. First thing is to find out if you are compensating for the lack of a social life with other items such as food, alcohol, internet, video games, porn etc and start cutting those things out completely so that your brain doesn't have a crutch to hang on to, I think people with social anxiety have mastered the art of developing coping mechanisms to deal with their lack of a social life, and those coping mechanisms need to be completely cut off in order to get out of this rut. The only thing is that you will go into a period of withdrawal similar to a drug addict who stops using drugs, which you need to be prepared for (dopamine related). Then I think the second thing to do is to go out into public just to be exposed to other people, even if you're not directly communicating with them, such as going out to the grocery store, boardwalk, gym, etc so that you're seeing other people and not isolated in your house. These are at least the first steps.	Awe_Moon	reply	na	na	na	0.9993959665298462	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"I went to a wedding recently (a wedding I was in actually bc it was my brother getting married) and oh my God, I feel physically attacked by the memories. 

The worst is when I recall the husband of another bridesmaid. He stared at me during the reception and then later at the after party told me about a bachelor party he went to in Florida about the “amazing” soundtrack, and at some point, he said some thing about a strip club (I was very drunk at this point). Anyway, it got to the point where he told me I could go down there and essentially marry a rich dude with a yacht. I wanted to kill him but I was also so drunk and so stupid that I didn’t discourage him either (he wasn’t hitting on me but it was still weird). I ended the conversation really awkwardly too. Another bridesmaid also heard conversation and just looked at me like I was crazy. The next day, I see the brother-in-law of the bride, and he just rolls his eyes. I I don’t think they talk to one another or anything I just think maybe he doesn’t like me for whatever reason. I literally want to kill myself.

Please help me stop thinking about this! Any tips are welcome. Right now I’m just drinking every day and it’s really fucking with my life. 

I know it’s not the worst thing in the world and with any luck I will never see half those people again, but fuck. I seriously don’t trust myself.

"Go out to eat at your favorite restaurant. Watch a movie or show. Go hang out with people you like. Find some hard crossword puzzles online and don't let yourself think about the conversation until you've solved them. Clean something you've been putting off. Take a nap, and listen to music while you're trying to fall asleep so you have something to focus on.

You have to build up healthy coping mechanisms. You have to find something that keeps your mind distracted, or at least lets you self-soothe, without ruminating or abusing substances. You need to figure out what your favorite things to do are, and then you need to commit to doing them instead of circling conversations around in your head.

Drinking just postpones the fix. Try running or walking instead. Preferably out in nature and without music. I used to take 2 to 4 hour walks to clear my head, now I run for 45 to 90min. Instead of numbing it with the drinking its better to allow yourself to process and feel what you need to feel to move on.

I went through the same exact thing as you a few weeks ago. Been struggling with social anxiety for a few months. I do mine virtually through teledoc and I do phone instead of video. Is that an option for you? I'll be honest even the phone conversation had my heart pounding out of my chest and I used ice packs to calm me down but I told her up front that I was very nervous and how badly I wanted to hang up lol. Therapy isn't easy to start, even for people who have zero anxiety. But just try and remember they are there to listen, not to judge and anything you have to say they have heard 100 times before and know how to help you. I've now talked with her 3 times and have a 4th scheduled. It has helped a lot already, just to get my thoughts out there.

Due to there being zero available psychiatrists I had to go through my primary care physician for help. She first prescribed me lexapro, then prozac, then zoloft. They all made me extremely tired and reduced my nether region into a numb stick while simultaneously doing nothing for my anxiety. When I told her none of them were working she threw her hands up and said she couldn’t help me anymore. I don’t know where to go from here.	ivyhyung	post	12.167916689852307	female	White	0.9993552565574646	na	na	na	4	socialanxiety

"I’m worried about my brother and don’t know how to help him. For context, we are both the same age, we didn’t have the best childhood and so I think that affected him the most. Growing up he has always been the “shy one” and has always been a loner in school.
As far as I know, he doesn’t have any social interactions beside me, my dad and my grandmother. My dad has had 2 girlfriends since my mom and the first one lived with us for 3 years in which he probably only spoke 3 sentences to her- that is how bad it is! He spoken to in public he just nods and he walks with his head down. He has become one of those ‘incels’ whereby he only talks about Andrew Tate and those types. He only leaves the house to go out with dad/grandmother and college. 
On top of this I am so worried about his mental health 
He doesn’t think that there is any problem with how he is and thinks that he will somehow grown one day and be this ‘alpha male’ without making any changes- how do I help someone who doesn’t oesnt want or hear it?"

The feeling almost made me feel nauseous but I let it sit. I cried until I couldn’t cry (for now). I wrote in a journal too. That felt good. But I miss having a friend that’s local. I have friends but they all live in different states. I’m introverted and Im okay with this but at times, I just feel alone and want someone to go out with and have fun.

"So back when i was in college, i had this really weird irrational fear of people watching what i was doing at all times and thinking they are judging me or laughing at me secretly, for example when we had to do an assignment where we had to pick two music videos of our choice to watch and compare the music genres of the videos and the style etc. (This was in media studies)

So as i was watching this music video i felt so embarrassed and i wanted to hide the entire time, what made it worse was this one girl was laughing behind me and i didn't know if she was laughing at me or what i was watching? Also if we had to get ideas for a specific topic or something i just felt so stupid and dumb all the time.

Here’s a tip. Just apply to jobs you don’t mind (incase your actually consider them) and then go do the interview. This way you get some interviews under your belt and more experience. You don’t have to take the job it’s the real interview experience that helps. You can literally do like 20 of them if you want just to help you get the nerves out. The first one isn’t going to be to work on tm your interview skills, it’ll just be to beg over the anxiety, doesn’t matter what happens. Then maybe write down any notes you have after words on what you can improve and go to the next and try to do those things. You know stuff like that. It might help. Also I would recommend using the first ice breaker interview to be something like macys or something low down as to minimize initial anxiety.

"Basically I was born and bought up in a small village/town, I did complete my graduation from a small college in my town. This is effecting me a lot as I need to move to a city soon. First problem is fear of speaking English, although I can write or think in English quite ok ish but speaking is kinda hard for me. It's not like I cannot speak but i am not used to speaking it as in my college we used to speak in my native language. Just the sight of seeing city kids spooks me out for some reason. 

Also I grew up to be an introvert for some reason. It was alright until I hit puberty, everything changed after that. I did put an effort to improve myself from past 2 years and I did improve but not enough. 

The company I am visiting now is not in a big city but comparatively it's quite a big city and there are lots of modern universities out there and I don't really think I can compete against those grads.

"Hi all. I posted this is an autism thread and didn’t get any responses (which is fine of course). Posting here in case anyone has had something similar and any tips :)

I've had social anxiety most of my life and diagnosed as autistic two years ago (age 43). With covid being less of an issue these days (fingers crossed) I'm back in the office a lot more and really struggling with my anxiety. What I've come to realise is that it's mainly around situations where a lot of eye contact is involved or 'required'. For instance, running into people in the corridor or kitchen, any situations where I have to directly face someone standing opposite me. I don't know where to look, how to stand, feel panicked and immediately look to get out of the situation. And I avoid situations where it might occur. If I am sitting or standing off to the side a bit of someone I am fine - i.e. I can handle a bit of eye contact and then look away again and it all feels natural. Directly facing some just seems too much. Another weird thing I noticed is that, when we were all wearing those masks that covered our mouths during covid, I was fine with these situations (directly facing someone and talking), so it's maybe less about the eye contact itself and perhaps the amount of facial queues I'm trying to interpret? Does anyone else have this problem and any tips for dealing with it?"	Impressive_Pair_721	post	32.3464375414174	male	White	0.9958469271659851	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety

For exemple when someone asked me to join them in a group project at school, I always felt like they just wanted me because i would be working hard so they could just chill during class and not because they liked my presence.

Or when a ""friend"" would try to hype me up for a party i was always thinking they just needed me to host it since i lived alone. I often just ended up alone and not speaking with anybody the whole night and felt more like a burden than part of the group.

When I eventualy quit school, some classmates told me they didn't understand and asked me to stay, but once again all I can think of is they just didn't want to loose their usefull classmate and party hoster. None of them ever reached out to me after that.

I could go on and on about a lot of similar instance down to the smalest thing. I just reason that i'm being paranoïd but i just can't stop to feel this way. I instinctively take the smalest hint of kindness or interest toward me like a red flag and feel like it's turning me into a bitter and soulless person and i can't help it."	lLePouletMasque	post	20.87553523820698	male	White	0.9986650943756104	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety

a band that i really like is going to play near me in a couple months. tickets are fairly cheap and they are playing really close to me. however, i’ve never been to a concert before and i’ve always avoided opportunities to go to concerts because i am really scared of a crowd/being packed in with people, super loud music, and just the social aspect like am i supposed to just sit and listen? sing and dance? the whole thing just makes me anxious to think about. but at the same time, im considering just facing my fear and going. can anyone tell me what it’s like to go to a concert/if i’m being silly or if there is a chance i may get scared being there?

"Hi, I'm new but I just wanted to say a quick message, here :

You're all really amazing... Really, you don't need/have to change for other people... and be yourself is always the best way to go, even if it's not easy... 

Your kindness is your weapon, with kindness you can do a lot of things... (But don't give your kindness to toxic people 🙃👍) 

You can be sad sometimes, you can be depressed, anxious, but don't give up, things will be OK for you...

"This is such good advice. Where to shift our attention in an anxious or otherwise hard situation... I agree 100% that has to be kindness. Not some technique, but rather positivity! Conversations are simply for sharing kindness, not for trying to boast your ego, or showing up as ""the best version of yourself."" 

I would say I'm not the greatest in conversations, but really Im sure it's about being interested in the situation and the person your talking to and having fun.

But for us anxious we think upside down .(not our fault!)  We think we need to be something else than ourselves to be accepted, when it's no big deal at all. I swear some people don't even realize theyre having an hour long Convo, just goes to show that we think it too serious! 

The key is not to blame ourselves. Dont mind if you miss an interesting conversation with somebody cuz of anxiety, it's still just a conversation! They come and go. 

Also just say something that resonates with you, simple things when said can open a bigger door in somebody's mind if you have passion in your words. And here I find myself giving advice although I can barely even talk to anybody at my school... 

Reddit is a good place for finding support, that's all you need, kindness once again. You don't even know how interesting you are, you can only find that out by expressing. Embrace the smallest interactions, that's what anxiety teaches. 

Also, don't look to people for entertainment. Some do that, and expect you to be interesting, and that's ok, but I swear, there are people just like you who only want to feel that they are seen. 

So when you get the chance, don't try to push things out but let it flow, your presence is enough. 

Forgiveness is the cure to anxiety in my opinion, forgiving the situations that are now past has helped me, it's still lingering there but now for me it's a matter of getting the experiences where I feel alright as myself to prove the last bits of anxiety they're free to go."

It is a terrible feeling, but unfortunately it’s something we have to get used to. It’s not always a winner! But the lack of reaction doesn’t necessarily mean it wasn’t funny, it could have been that they didn’t hear you or that they don’t have the same sense of humor as you.

"Venting.

Just heard that song ""Born to be wild"" by Steppenwolf, I love music like that, it makes me picture summer adventures with friends, driving in a car, jumping into the sea.

But looking back, i never experienced that though i always longed to have friendships, i'm 26 and have been so alone and unable to let people in.

Strange, i always thought eventually it would happen, but now i'm an adult with growing responsibilities and feel like i'll never experience carefree youth.

I barely have enough energy to do my own things after a 40h workweek, let alone socialising...

"First off, do you hate yourself? Would you call someone you care about socially inept? Maybe. But you're just bullying yourself if youre focusing on such things rather than focusing on how to fix the problem. But how do we fix it?

Know that deep down, many if not most people have insecurities. Some just hide it better than others. Even when it looks like most people have friends, some still feel lonely with surface-level friendships. You know the pain of feeling like you're not enough. 

The reality is most people are absorbed in their own world. There's so much to do, constantly busy. The pain of life, many of us hide under masks. Because we don't want to bother others. Or because we feel they might not care anyways. 

You know, every skill just requires a certain understanding of the patterns. Not feeling adept at a particular skill just means you haven't found the patterns that work for you yet. Or that you haven't practiced enough. Everyone starts from somewhere.

Imagine this. Someone who feels so unloved by society and so alone hitting rock bottom. They start  taking care of themselves and focusing on bringing joy to those around them. Inspiring someone else who was about to end it all to give life another chance. To give themselves another chance. One success turns another life around.

Just came back from an interview, so basically there is a friend of my family where i worked as a waiter once for a party. I did quite good there but its already like 10 months ago. He wants me to waiter again for one day and i accepted since i am still a student and i could need some Money. Anyway we met up in a cafe with 5 other people all around my age because they are gonna work as a waiter there aswell, he explained what we will have to do etc. He wanted me to explain to the others how i did it the last time i worked there but i couldnt bring out a single normal sentence since i kept stuttering and spoke really unclear because i cant really talk with strangers. That was really awkward for me and the others noticed it aswell. Since he ordered drinks for us when we arived at the cafe, one waiter came and gave us our drinks. The Waiter wanted to put my drink on the Table but i thought she hands it to me and i wanted to grab it, it spilled over the entire table and on the Paperwork of the employer which made the situation even worse for me since the others started to laugh a little but the employer told me that its okay and i can Waiter there anyway. Now i will waiter there this week with the People that laughed at me and tbh i dont even know if i should go there, since it made me even more anxious now to work there	Future-Supermarket57	post	29.457785005647033	male	White	0.9994843006134033	na	na	na	18	socialanxiety

"Aw I’d totally be the same. But I truly think this is one of those times that you’ll look back on and laugh too. Spilling your drink all over your interviewer and still getting the job? That’s a story I’d be saving to tell my future kids! 

If I saw this this happen to someone, I’d laugh. But not in a way to make fun of them..I wouldn’t think anything like “ha, that person’s so nervous they spilled their drink”.. it would be more like “lol I can’t believe that happened”.. like it’s something out of a cartoon! 
I know how embarrassing it must feel, but trust me they weren’t laughing at your embarrassment. 

Most importantly… you did it, you got the job! As someone who’s too nervous to even make it out my front door for a job interview, I have to say major congrats. The hardest part is literally over. You don’t need to prove yourself to anyone else.. you just have the job to focus on, which you already have experience with so you’ll be great. 

And don’t worry about the others! Don’t assume they were laughing in a cruel way.. maybe you can even connect with one of them over this experience. Next time I see them I’d be like “yo, remember the interview?💀” and break the ice.

Hey man, this is totally me except I wouldn't even make it there in the first place lol. Trust me, because I know my brain is just giving me shit all day, the people there forgot it maybe an hour later. They will not think about it when you're there, this shit happens to everyone, not just us. Own it, it can feel like the end of the world but actually, no one cares. You got a nice employer that comforted you and still wants you there. If it makes you feel better tell him about your condition but tell him that you want to improve yourself anyways. He will like that and if he's a good guy he will treat you accordingly. I managed to get a job once and I was totally honest about my social anxiety and people treated me with respect. Not like a baby but they definitely were more careful and I really appreciated that. I even told them it's fine, I can take a hit or two, just not to the extent that others can. Just go there, the worst mistake you can make is to let it get to you too much and not show up at all. Then the circle of isolation begins and it only becomes worse.

Did you know there were going to be that many people at the interview or were you expecting a classic one-one-one sort of deal? My anxiety spikes in particular when I’m confronted with something that I’m not expecting, so perhaps that significantly contributed to your less stellar performance this time around. I wouldn’t beat myself up over it though, since you’ve done the job before and it sounds like everything went a-okay so don’t let this small mishap bring you down. If you are really concerned about what the others may think of you, just try to laugh it off the next time that you are around them saying you were just having one of those rough days.

"ive been going to a new school lately, and its an okay school. ive only gone a few times, since its only once a week for an hour, but even then its so fucking hard to go anyways bwcause of the other students. ive always had worse social anxiety around other people my age, especially bwcause most other teenagers are really judgy and mean

these other students seem like the exact same type of people who would pretend to be my friend for a joke, or bully me online for being weird. but at the same time, i want to talk to these people so badly. i want to hang out with them and be able to sit with them and do school work and talk about our interests and play games together, but at the same time i cant. one of the other students literally looked at me the other day and made eye contact,  and i nearly broke down in tears. its just such a stupid and confusing thing :')

on one hand, i want to be friends with these people or atleast be able to have a conversation with them, but on the other im so scard of them from past experiences. and plus on that, even if i wasnt scared because of being bullied in the past, its not like i can physically even hold a conversation. whenever i force myself to actually talk to somebody im not okay with talking to, i literally lose the ability to speak! its like my voice clogs up, and at that point im most likely already literally running away to get away from the situation. and also, i feel like such a fucking asshole for judging these people just because of shit that's happened in the past. its not like theyd want to be friends anyways because i judge people so early on (╥﹏╥)

sorry for rambling on, i cant really talk about this to anybody else because theyll tell me to get over it or will just change the subject completely. im going to be 18 in a few years, so i know I'll have to ""get over it"" eventually, but its still so hard (´°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ω°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥｀)"	PancakeWafflez1	post	3.879047852237079	male	White	0.9985143542289734	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety
"Everything you’re feeling is totally valid! I understand being nervous around new people because of bad past experiences. I think the only way to get over that is to give these people a chance. If you haven’t seen them treat you or anyone else badly, there’s no reason to believe they would. 

I know it’s extremely difficult or feels nearly impossible, but to get better at talking to people you have to.. talk to people. It’s completely okay to be awkward and to make mistakes because it means you’re learning. You can start super small, like saying hi to them, giving them a compliment, or even just smiling/waving when they look your way, or anything else you can think of. The more you start to get out of your comfort zone, the easier it will be. Try not to think too hard of what to say and remember it’s okay to be spontaneous. You’re gonna be rejected sometimes which will be incredibly discouraging, but over time you’ll have just as many good experiences as bad ones. 

But the most important thing to remember is to be PATIENT with yourself. Talk to yourself the way you would want other people to talk to you. You’re not an asshole for judging people, and you’re not any less of a person for not knowing how to hold conversations. 

I hope this helps, please have faith and patience with yourself! You can become the person you want to if you put your mind to it, I believe in you 🫶 and one more thing, don’t be afraid to ask for help. It’d be great to find someone to confide in with all this, either a person you trust or some kind of therapist/counselor to help support you."

"this is probably just going to be a vent.

so recently i started getting back into the dating scene and tried my luck with a guy who i met online and lived in the same city as me. we met up twice, first time it was alright, i guess kinda fun because meeting ppl for the first time terrify but also excite me at the same time. the second time was okay but it was very awkward and uncomfortable at times. my friends told me that i should make it clear that i'm not romantically interested in him and if i wanted to be friends then i should also tell him so.

the problem for me was that i kept overthinking how i should convey it to him due to the fact that there were no actual indications that it was a 'date' as there were no signs or anything, idk how to explain it for it to make sense. in short i ended up chickening out and we ended the day on a okay note.

almost a week passed and i was relieved as there were no follow-up messages because i had realized that i was just not interested in him in a romantic nor platonic sense. there was just no chemistry nor overlapping interests which would've been useful. but today he messaged me asking me how i am and i know it's so stupid to overreact but right now i'm stressed whether i should reply or not. the rational side tells me that i should time him i'm fine etc. and if he wants to meet up again i would tell him i'm not interested. but on the other side i'd rather just ghost him so i won't need to face any kind of confrontation. because i'm pretty sure he wants to meet again but i can't explain to you why.

you can easily ghost him, i’m not sure why everyone is begging you not to. you both went a week without messaging each other so it’s not like he’s attached to you or anything. if he thought the date went so well, he probably would’ve keep messaging you afterwards and not wait a week. the point is, ghosting him probably wouldn’t hurt him considering you only hung out once and still barely know each other. if i were you, i would ghost him without a second thought. i don’t believe you owe him anything, you do what is most comfortable and best for your mental health.	user6273363766262	reply	na	na	na	0.9988344311714172	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"Aw hang in there. I can relate to that self consciousness. I’m not trying to lose weight but I want to go out and practice driving. I’m so afraid of looking dumb, so I’ve been avoiding it. I think its definitely “performance anxiety”.  It’s a certain kind of social anxiety. It’s the fear about being seen and judged.

That extra (irrational?) fear of getting robbed might be your brain making up more reasons and excuses to not go. The brain is trying to protect you from the perceived danger of being seen. The brain has got to get required. 

I’ve been meaning to take baby steps…like going for more short walks around the block or doing stuff in my front yard. I figure exposing myself will help lessen that performance anxiety. I find that when I take care of myself by showering, wearing clean clothes and doing minimal makeup, I’m a little more confident. 

Good luck. if you wanted advice from someone who does not have it figured out lol…here it is. Take baby steps. Go outside a tiny bit everyday. Even just around the block is good. It might be too much to go outside and exercise right away. (If so, try in-home workouts while you figure this out.)

"It has only been recently that I realized with myself, that the terrible and irrational feelings, negative self talk, destructive behaviour and ruined relationships have been because of my deep-rooted social anxiety. It has even gotten to the point now where it has made me seriously depressed because of the isolation and loneliness I have caused myself to be in. 

So I finally took charge and made an appointment with the doctor to hopefully find a form of treatment for it. The issue is, I have been so effective at hiding and suppressing my anxiety, and it has been so long that I have dealt with this, that I don't even know where to begin. And im afraid she won't believe me, think that im overexaggerating. 

I have seen a therapist for a few months, and it has helped in some ways, but not in any way that has alleviated my anxiety, so I am interested in seeing if medications could be a thing that would work for me. 

&#x200B;

How do I go about this conversation with my doctor? and how do I keep it short and simple so she understands the situation im in?

My anxiety is taking over my life. I can’t talk to ANYONE (not even my parents or siblings) without overthinking every single word that comes out of my mouth. I am never present in the moment because my head is clouded with anxiety.  I am very short with people because I literally just don’t know what to say. I have a script in my head that I go by and when all of those phrases run out, the conversation is done for. I am mentally drained from the battle I fight in my head constantly. People wonder why I spend so much time locked away in my room, on my phone? It’s because it’s my only peace. I have dealt with this almost all my life, It’s a miracle I still pull myself out of bed in the morning. I wish my family and those around me could walk in my shoes for a day.

"I feel like with everybody I talk to, I never hit it off with them or strike any type of connection with them...I'm always just easily forgettable and discarded. A few, very few people in my life have given me a chance and stuck around and saw that I was cool to talk to and a good friend after a bit. But most people just leave and forget about me after only a short interaction, before they really get to know anything about me. It's like they decide right away that I'm not worth their time, like they form some judgment about me in their head and just leave.

I admit that I'm slow to open up with strangers, I can't come up with a billion crazy topics or just flood them with witty jokes straight out the gate, and they give up so quick. I know I would be more likable if I was all smiley and happy and really fast to open up to people, if I could just joke around with people the second I meet them, but I'm just not that way and never have been. I can do that stuff more once I test the waters and know them for a while, but it's like everybody just fades on me before that happens. I do try to ask people questions about themselves and such but it doesn't really make any difference. And some people are really dry with me and don't do much to make the interaction any deeper, even when I'm genuinely trying, and then they just leave. It sucks."

I’m sure you’ll find the right people in time. Just make sure to initiate as much as possible! If you liked talking to someone, ask if you can hang out or talk again sometime. They might reject you, but the ones who don’t will be interested in getting to talk to you more.

"I don't even know where to meet people. I try going out on walks, I've tried coffee shops, I'll try sitting on benches and just hanging out in some common space, I've also tried bars and clubs now and then (but not often as I don't recover very well from alcohol), I've tried dating and friend-making apps. Maybe these ideas sound lame but I literally don't know what else there is. I've been doing this for so long and I never meet anybody, everybody else is just busy with their friends or their partners, I get ignored or left-swiped on every app there is, and I just come away without ever meeting anyone. If I try talking to someone, I'm just bothering them and causing some huge disruption to their day. I keep thinking ""there has to be someone, one person, just one person"" but there literally never is. Not even a small interaction.

You might say ""well you shouldn't do that stuff with the goal of meeting people"", but if meeting people wasn't a motivator, I wouldn't be walking around or sitting outside in 90 degree heat, I wouldn't be paying $8 for a coffee sitting in some awkward quiet shop with uncomfortable chairs, I wouldn't be putting myself through the anxiousness of going out to a bar alone and paying $8 for a beer and dealing with a hangover.

She told him that her mom said she was homeless, because she called HER homeless, and he replied ""why would say that"" and some other stuff and they just continued to laugh and playfully joke anddd I feel like I could say the same exact random goofiness and people would give me the side eye and say ""who tf says that"" either outlaid or in their mind... and it seems like everyone else is allowed to be annoying, quirky, silly, personable, random, anything you could think of... but with me its like if I tried to be those things.. I'd be labeled as annoying.. and it hurts.

 I also feel like being ugly doesn't help because I feel like when you're ugly if you're talkative people perceive you as ""Annoying"", whereas they'd perceive you as charismatic and funny if you're attractive.. it's just getting to me because I feel so alone and unlikable and feel as if I'm not allowed to have deep connections with anyone because it seems like no one wants to be friends with me no matter what I say or do. I feel like people are embarrassed to be seen even talking to me, forget hanging out with me. Everyone at almost every job I've had have always been so close to the point they change numbers and they got to each other's houses. 

I remember one time I suggested to a supervisor I was having good convo with that we could hang outside of work and she lied and said she doesn't hang with people outside of work even though before she told me about all the people she would hang with outside of work and who she WANTED to hang out with here and that just crushed my soul because its like there's something so OFFPUTTING and repulsive about me that it makes people not want to be around me.. and yes ugliness is one of those things, but I also took into account that I may be awkward or whatever so I tried being confident lol and people got annoyed and said I was arrogant and this is where I feel like the horn effect fucks me up when trying to make friends. I just feel like everyone hates me and would rather not have to interact with me at all... anyone else relate?"	kelpkelpers	post	12.01512926479817	male	White	0.9959015250205994	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety
"A lot of a joke is in the execution. And people have different senses of humor: if you personally don't find the joke funny, when you try to replicate that goofiness, it would likely not land as well since your heart isn't in it

Try having fun with it more and less focus about doing annoying things that others do. Though its good to have inspiration so maybe there's more than meets the eye about the things that seem stupid but works. Such as context or inside jokes. Perhaps more analysis is needed

Also people like those who listen, not just humor. Which can go hand in hand since listening and getting to know someone can give you more to work with when coming up with jokes that you both would find funny

Maybe people don't feel like you listen to them or perhaps they feel you're trying too hard for attention. Seems like your intention is trying to get people to like you. But coming off too strong makes people subconsciously think you want something from them. So instead, it's good to take it slow; the more you know about someone, the easier it is to relate and vibe with

Hopefully that helps!"	kelpkelpers	reply	na	na	na	0.9959015250205994	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"I agree, if you try to add to the goofiness without actually finding it funny, you can come off as fake or even like you’re making fun of them. I think the best policy is always to be yourself, as much as you possibly can. Say things that you think are funny, don’t be 100% agreeable all the time, be honest.

I also think that maybe you should take things less personally. Has anyone every told you that you’re repulsive or that they think you’re annoying or that they never want to interact with you? If not, there’s no reason to think so. I think that when we believe something about ourselves, we search for pieces of evidence that will prove it. So if you think you’re repulsive, you’re gonna interpret every “bad” interaction or social cue to mean that the other person thinks you’re repulsive, even if they really don’t think that way. Be kind to yourself and build yourself up. What you think about yourself 100% affects the way other people think of you, so you need to focus on positive things instead of negative. I hope this helps 🫶"	kelpkelpers	reply	na	na	na	0.9959015250205994	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety

I have a job at a store, and luckily I don't have to work directly with customers much, but they do come up to ask me questions. Every time it happens, without fail, I feel my brain shut down. I feel sick and I get tunnel vision. I can still manage to answer but it feels like my chest and lungs are being crushed and every time they walk away I have to take several breaths.

"Try greeting everyone for a day. I mean beat them to it.  

Say hello, good morning, good afternoon, etc. Take notes on their response. Almost aways, they will say hello back and thats it. No need for anything further and you go back to what you were doing and they go back to what they were doing. 

Next day or week, follow up the greeting with asking if you can help them find anything. Again keep notes of their response. It is a lot easier to deal with the anxiety when you can be helpful. It can give you a sense of purpose instead feeling awkward.

"New school, nervous of course. But it went so well. This is gonna be long but I really hope that this can motivate someone else and perhaps even help. This is coming from a person who has had social anxiety for several years, who is on medication, has had 5 different therapists and has ran away from school many, many times. I say this as what I did today was, insane. Last year I could barely move around when I was in a classroom. Something in the air is just different at this new school.

&#x200B;

I was able to talk to my teachers, who are so kind towards me. I've been able to ask questions (of course, when it's only been us.) They, unlike other schools I've been to: ensure that *nobody* gets left behind. I almost didn't go to lunch yesterday because I was so afraid I'd have fo find a table on my own and sit by myself.

But no, one of the teachers stayed behind and waited for me! We have to scan a tag before getting our lunch (it's for statics, to see how many people get lunch daily. It helps to see how much food needs to be cooked.) And I was so worried, I nervously told the teacher as we were walking to lunch that I had no idea how this would go and she then said ''I have never done this before either, let's do it together'' And it calmed me down a bit and it went well!

We ate together and it went good!

Today, first thing we did was we got to pick cards how we felt with different expressions. I picked one that looked a little uncomfortable and we got to say why we picked it. (not required) I ended up saying ''no comments'' on mine and my teachers laughed. Which felt nice.

Later we played a yes/no game. Basically we had a paper, one side where it stood yes and the other side where it stood no. The teacher asked questions and we held up the paper. For example: I like to cook. Then you'd either pick yes or no and you got to know your classmates a little without saying anything.

After that we played yet another get-to-know-each-other game. Oh boy, I was nervous alright. It was either you and one other person or 2 others. I got to be with a really nice girl who I had things in common with and we laughed a lot.

We went to lunch again and she came together with me and the teachers and we sat together. I talked a little bit there and asked if I could do a project on frogs and the answer was yes.

Well, I even dared to reach up my hand to answer a question in class! I haven't done that in 5 years!

Lastly, we went on a short walk together and the girl I had been playing the get-to-know-each-other game ended up walking next to me. I hesitated a bit but I asked her if the coffee she got was good and from there we small talked a bit until we got to school!

I also told my teachers when everybody had left that I was shocked how well it had gone today when they asked how I had liked the day. I explained that I am so used to being left behind, being alone and they said that they would never allow anybody to be left behind or alone. And I felt so seen. This school focus a lot on health, both mental and physical so coming here, knowing that these people understand, is *amazing.* 

That was pretty much it, I did some other smaller things today that weren't as bold. But I am so happy! :D"	4valentin	post	17.693647254123224	female	White	0.0011310940608382225	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety

I told my parents that I wish they would’ve started me in therapy for social anxiety when I was younger so it wasn’t as prevalent in my every day young adult life. Exposure therapy is sometimes the only thing that helps. It would’ve helped me significantly with college, ranging from class presentations and how to make friends. My brother is a teen now and struggles with it worse than I do and my parents started looking into therapy for him.	First_Ad_3731	reply	na	na	na	0.9930921792984009	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"I'm just going to say some of the things I wish my parents did for me. Firstly, instil confidence in your child. I don't know exactly how to do that but you should try build your child up to be confident. For me going to the gym was good for my confidence. Maybe you could encourage your son to do the same. Invest in your child so if they do show interest in going to the gym, then buy them things that they would need like protein powder and workout gear. 

Also you could try giving your child an incentive to go out of their comfort zone. You could say if you do 'x', you receive 'y'. All tho they may not actively choose to do these things themselves, they may find enjoyment in it and be happy that they did go out of their comfort zone.

Because they're in their teenage years it would probably be difficult to get them into reading. But audio books can help a lot with understanding yourself and managing social anxiety. You could also try giving them incentive to listen to audiobooks. 

Last but not least, talk to your child and find out how they feel about their situation. Talk about how they feel and how they think. Maybe they would like to go out more but they feel that they lack something that you could support them with. Ultimately find out what your child wants for themselves and find a way to support them."

I’ve struggled with social anxiety for nearly my entire 25 years of life. Ever since I can remember I was alone and by myself throughout my entire schooling which was incredibly hard and painful. I used to believe that I was simply not socially skilled enough to date or develop any sort of social life. However, last year I started seeing a pricey psychologist that is experienced in cbt. I visited the psychologist every week and put in a lot of work in between each visit. For almost 9 months I was skeptical that this therapy would do anything for me and then I met a new coworker who would later turn out to be my first girlfriend ever. Just like the other people in this subreddit I too wish my parents would’ve started me when I was much younger so I would strongly advise trying to get your kid help as soon as possible so the anxiety provoking thoughts and beliefs he has about himself don’t get as deeply ingrained as they did for me. Before I had a psychologist I saw two different licensed clinical social workers both of which didn’t seem to understand me or the way my brain functions and I eventually stopped seeing them. I would also suggest looking for a psychologist that is experienced in cbt related to anxiety disorders and not a “lcsw” licensed clinical social worker. Often times psychologists are more experienced and just more knowledgeable than clinical social workers. With all that said, I still have social anxiety and always will, however I can now talk myself through anxiety provoking situations instead of avoiding them and I’m the happiest I can ever remember being. Please do everything you possibly can to help your kid.	First_Ad_3731	reply	na	na	na	0.9930921792984009	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
If I could go back to being a teen I think the best approach would have been baby steps. For people with anxiety we're often forced to jump right into things we aren't prepared for and end up having bad, scary experiences that only make us more scared the next time. So my advice would be to create or find scenarios that feel like small steps where he feels in control (he can leave if he wants to etc). Its all about exposing yourself to 'safe' scenarios where you only push the boundary a little and experience small bits of growth each time, building your comfort and confidence.

"Hi! I'm going to the hairdresser for the first time tomorrow and I just want to know, how exactly do you explain what you want??? 

I already feel utterly embarrassed saying the name of a dish from a menu, so how can I describe something I want in DETAIL? Since it's my first time going I really don't want to end up regretting it immediately afterwards, but I also can't stand the thought of explaining myself for longer than one short sentence. Especially because the other person will intently listen, which is their job of course, but makes me feel even more nervous. I have pictures, but I'm afraid going ""Sorry I can't explain but I have pics, here:"" would be a little rude? weird? I've been thinking about potential answers like crazy for most of the day, so how do you explain your haircut usually? One that's more than just a trim?

(The smalltalk also scares me, but I think I can manage to put out some generic or sarcastic answers. It honestly gives me a bad feeling that I'm not too worried about that part yet lol.)

It's not weird at all. The best thing to do is show them a picture of what you want. I would also suggest looking up videos on YouTube of the hairstyle you want, where the person cutting will explain how to get it. Specifically, check out the Salon Guy on YouTube.

I’m going to get straight to the point here. I had it way better than my parents. Grew up in a nice house, with two parents that both make decent money. They had the opposite growing up and they work hard for their money. I on the other hand, work two very nice jobs but am slowly getting to the point where I can live on my own. They are mad that I don’t work that hard physically and make good money and barely work. One of the jobs I work I am a buyer and seller so I only have to leave house to go to post office couple times per week. My dad fixes cars and my mom is a practical nurse. Pretty much impossible to be respected by them. I know you’re going to say move away from them but I can’t yet. Once I get a little better at my one gig I will be able to. But probably not for a few months maybe another year or two at home. They always want me to work some dirty hard job just so I’m like them. I’m just different than my parents and they can’t accept that or something. Can anyone else relate ? What types of things should I say ?

I mostly tell myself that it’s okay to mistakes, I’m learning, I’m struggling but that doesn’t mean it won’t get better, I’ve come such a long way, etc. Patience and faith in yourself are the most important things to remember, I hope this helps 🫶"	granntjamisunn	reply	na	na	na	0.9980583786964417	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

In uni, at the gym, wherever I go I have this desire to connect with others, I'm able to smile and make short conversation like say hi or give a compliment. But I can't stick around, I know it’s just in my head. I feel like it’s because deep down I don’t feel authentic. I don’t enjoy making conversation or getting to know others like I used to. And it’s sabotaging opportunities to make new relationships. Do you guys have any tips and advice?	Hour-Clue-3748	post	19.811182995308094	male	White	0.9990267753601074	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety

Not specifically for social anxiety, but for depression and general anxiety, though it's also helpful for social anxiety. There are exercises in every chapter, so you really get to apply the coping/recovery strategies to your own  experiences. The book has been around forever, but therapists still use it because it's genuinely helpful.

For awhile I had a subscription to an app called Headspace, which had a lot of guided meditations designed for different situations, and I found it really helpful.

i want to share something almost insignificant, i was walking on the street, taking advantage of my free time i wanted to find out which subway exit was best for me, but i didn't have my transportation card, i was about to return home, but i challenged myself to ask a stranger to use his card so i could get in, my anxiety is not as big as before, but i noticed that the discomfort was present before approaching the stranger, not during the conversation, when i spoke i even forgot about it, I simply left by the opposite exit without using the train. i found it interesting and wanted to share it. i am still socially awkward tho.

I’ve been attending a virtual therapy group for almost a month now and I am constantly left out by one person in the group. This person always seems to make a point to make me feel like I don’t belong, whether it be by making snarky comments when I finally get the courage to make a response to a question the group facilitator asked, talking over me or needing to one up my answers or by very obviously leaving me out when this person greets everyone else in the group except for me. I’ve never done anything to this person, I’ve just existed and that has been a problem for them. And it doesn’t help that everyone else in the group gravitates towards this person, making this situation feel even worse for me. I feel like I’ll never belong anywhere, I’ll always be picked out and ostracized because I’m me, my simple existence is a problem for others. I can’t even get help in therapy anymore, I’m just ready to give up.	Mother_Ad_5218	post	9.86957597264244	female	White	0.9995085000991821	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety
"Please reach out privately to the group facilitator. Let them know how this is affecting you, and ask them for a solution. If they're unable to assure you that they'll handle it, ask for a referral to another group. 

I'm so sorry this is happening. Therapy should be a safe space, and the facilitator really ought to have noticed the snarky comments and reigned them in. 

Please believe me when I tell you that none of this is happening because of you. Group therapy can be similar to individual therapy, or AA meetings, or even medications - sometimes you have to try a few different ones before you find one that clicks for you. And that's okay. 

Hopefully the facilitator can put the kibosh on this behaviour from the other participant and you can find success with this group. But if that doesn't happen, remember that it's not your failure if this group doesn't work out for you. I encourage you to try other groups until you find the one that will meet your needs. I have every confidence that it's out there.

Most importantly, remember that joining this group in the first place took a measure of strength and courage that many of us find hard to achieve. So remind yourself that you're already making positive steps towards overcoming your challenges, and that you can keep going. I'm proud of you. Be proud of yourself."

I’m so sorry this has been happening to you! Is it possible for you to join another therapy group? Or to join the same one but at a different time than the person who outcasts you? If not, then I’d suggest interacting with the other members of the group as much as possible. I know it’s hard, but stand up for yourself as much as possible. Talk when you want to talk and if you don’t give them any reasons to ostracize you, they won’t.	Mother_Ad_5218	reply	na	na	na	0.9995085000991821	strong	no	strong	na	socialanxiety

It’s extremely hard to deal with jobs with social anxiety. Applying is nerve wrecking then the employer randomly calls you in for an interview. The interview is nerve wrecking and scary  . So yeah you really just have to force yourself and push through it . It will definitely suck and be awkward the first few months at work but then you get comfortable and the anxiety lessens.

"I hear a lot of ""what if"" thoughts in this. That's your anxiety trying to protect you, but from what?  Anxiety's job is to keep you safe so if you are feeling anxious, that's because your brain thinks that you are in danger.  But you're not in danger, and if your brain could realize that it wouldn't produce anxiety.  

Here's what I do in situations like this and also have my daughter do and it works fantastic!  Talk to your anxiety.  Treat it as if it is your friend.  Even name it.  My anxiety's name is Lloyd and my daughter's is named Lily.  Sometimes just talking to your anxiety like a friend and thanking him for showing up and trying to help followed by letting him know that you are safe and not in danger so they can go sit back and relax.  You'll let them know if you need them.

This sounds goofy, silly, etc., but I'm telling you this works very well.

"Ah, I remember my first day at highschool, meeting new people and new place it was like sky falling on me, of course my fear eventually won and I was ""hiding"" quitting a lot of classes with an old friend spending time outside just to avoid that new experience, did that at least 4-5 months and ended up with awfull grades, not gonna lie I was disappointed in me, my mom told me all the time to stay in the class, a lot of arguments, I was angry but most of the time fam  members don't understand...
Anyway I started to face my fear after a few months, there was nothing to do about it, I ended up small talking about homework, tests, and this kind of sht, it was awfull at first but with time I was more and more confident, I made 3...let's say friends? Especially 2 of them, great guys to spend time with at highschool, I cut ties with them now, we are  barely talking after 8 years but that's that.

Currently as a fifth teen year old I am person who has been dealing with social anxiety and depression for many years so life is not always so easy for someone like me. I never really got a chance to experience what it’s like to have friends because I always had to stay at home. I have lost so many people in my life at such a young age. I watched my grandmother pass away and yesterday made it two years that she’s been gone. She was one of the people who raised me from a baby, someone I could talk to and she would listen no matter what, someone who was there for me when my mother basically abandoned me and it was hard for me to help dig a grave that I knew the next day she would be in and now my anxiety and depression is at a all time high to the point that I don’t want to go to school because I don’t want to be around people anymore because my mind has been trained to stay away from people I don’t know . I try to explain to my mom that I am going through a lot but she doesn’t really care that I’m hurting inside and therapy is not helping me anymore .

"First, hugs, I know your pain is real and it’s hard.  You said therapy isn’t working anymore.  Do you like your therapist? Can you be honest about this? If not, is it possible to find a new one?

As for school, are they aware of your anxiety? I have what I call escape hatches for students.  If you are overwhelmed in the moment you can go somewhere where everyone knows to welcome you no questions asked.  This is usually the library or the counseling center, but can also be a teachers classroom with their permission.

Does your school have any clubs that you connect to.  Esport, dungeons and dragons, table top gaming, movie club.  Some of these clubs are perfect for the kids who do not quite fit in the mainstream groups.

This is not your last chance, there are people who care and want to help, even if they are not the people you live with."	Accomplished-Pie-869	reply	na	na	na	0.9953843951225281	weak	no	strong	na	socialanxiety

"The college class i’m in is all about presentations and “ice breakers”. we had to introduce our partners in front of the class and the professor called on me for something else too. i feel so defeated because everything seems 10 times harder for me due to SA. i feel exhausted from one class. this all feels too fast paced for me. i am scared i will not finish college but i don’t really have any choice. i feel so badly the desire to be normal but  doomed for life because these thoughts have been in my head so long. even in preschool i was too shy to let people see me eat so i had to sit by myself.

"I am a freshman at my uni, and i know it just been only 2 weeks of classes, but everybody is getting along with everyone (playing games, little partying, walking and joking around). And there is me who cant even talk to a stranger to get along with them😭. Even with my roommates at dormitory, we don’t even talk a lot to each other during the day and even we do so it’s just a small talk about who will clean the room and stuff like that. I have such a strong feeling of fear that I will mess it up when I approach people and it makes me sad.

"I redownloaded a few dating apps and matched with a girl. Then for some stupid reason it gave me an option to automatically say hi without me typing that. So on the chat it typed out an emoji and ""how are you?"" I for some reason thought it was her who typed that out because the color of the text usually is like a darker blue or purple if that text is sent by you, but in this case it was light grey which often is the reciprocator. At first I was hesitent about saying anything because I was still trying go figure out who sent the text and next thing u know my dumbass decides to reply back to my own text thanking them for asking and then asking a question.

ok so I was interested in this on campus job that my community college is offering until I saw that you had to upload your resume. I have like 2 activities at most 1 being my moms short lived housekeeping business before the pandemic hit, and second my volunteering at a food pantry. How many activities should I rack up on my resume before I can safely apply to a job without them thinking “wow she’s unqualified”. I have a library volunteer position coming up so that’s an extra addition coming so. So should my resume take up a whole page before even thinking of applying to jobs? For people in this subreddit who have jobs did y’all just lie on your resume or actually cumulated a lot of extracurricular-like activities before going in? I know this post sounds like it should be on a career subreddit, but they wouldn’t understand why I barely have any activities due my social anxiety.	wurtheringheight	post	16.83098233893883	female	White	0.9991917014122009	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety
"Ok, so first of all, I would argue that most college students don't have a lengthy job history. Many probably don't have a history at all.

What type of work will this job require?

My first job was a retail job when I was 17. I didn't really even interview for it.

I didn't have a legit resume until I was 26.

So, I would put in a resume that would closely matched what you'll be doing at this job.

And don't worry about ""not being qualified"". People put applications in for jobs they are not qualified for every day. It's to be expected. Some employers exaggerate job requirements.

The worst they can say is no. And they wouldn't be offering the job to college students if they wanted you to have a ton of experience.

EDIT: Oh, and I would never out right lie on my resume. I fluff it up and make it sound like I know what I'm doing, but I don't lie on it."	wurtheringheight	reply	na	na	na	0.9991917014122009	no	no	strong	na	socialanxiety

"I wish to know how to be able to talk to people normally and how to socialise with women.
About me [I face all of these issues while interacting with males too]; 
- I cannot get out of my comfort zone at all. Even in my comfort zone, I feel like I might/am being judged. Whatever i say/How i behave might come across as stupid which would cause the friendship etc to break. This always holds me back.
- I'm not able to make eye contact, Whenever i try to make eye contact i feel like the other person will get the idea that I'm staring at them judging them,making them uncomfortable. 
- I do not avoid social situations. I try to participate in social events but i simply cannot be myself because anxiety rules me. 
About me and my relationship with girls;
- I absolutely want to socialise with girls but always fail to do so because I've never ever in my life interacted with girls of my age or girls a bit older than me. Studied in an all boys school and don't have any girls in my family. Why I'm scared of talking to them:
1 - Culturally, I'll be seen as a criminal for talking to random girls because it's not something which is culturally encouraged.

2  - What if her father/boyfriend beats me for talking to her?

3 - She wouldn't be interested in me for the reasons i mentioned above and will judge me.

4 - Everyone will say that I'm a loser for ""trying to talk to a girl"" despite knowing that I'm a loser i am due to my anxiety and looks.

5 - I know in advance I won't be able to make eye contact with her because If i do try to make it I'll come across as a creep.

6 - Obviously I always put females on a pedestal because it is so rare for me to talk to them."	FamousComb3649	post	11.199033963503652	female	White	0.9981319308280945	na	na	na	4	socialanxiety

">3 - She wouldn't be interested in me for the reasons i mentioned above and will judge me.

I can't speak to the cultural differences in Asia, I'm sure there's things I can say that simply don't apply there. However, at the most basic level, what do you have to lose?

Think of it this way, and this goes for more than just talking to women; right now you have no contact with women. Say you talk to a woman, and she rejects you, what changes? Nothing, you still have no contact with women. What did you gain? Experience. Rejection is part of the experience all around the world, culture doesn't change that little fact. In other words, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

Again, no expert on Asian culture or how courting women generally goes where you live. But one thing that is universally true no matter where you go is that women find confidence incredibly attractive. That's something you can't fake, it's something you'll have to learn and train. And the only way to train your social skills and confidence is simply to keep trying. Talk to women where it is acceptable to do so (parties, coworkers, etc.), try to keep eye contact (that doesn't mean stare all the time, it's fine to look away), and just have a conversation. If it gets awkward, let it get awkward and learn from it. Try again next time, and again, and again. You'll see it gets easier every time until it becomes second nature. 

Also, go to the gym. Regardless of culture there's two things universally true. You'll be more confident if you're proud of your body, and you'll be more attractive to women if you've got a bit of muscle on you. You don't have to be a body builder, just going to the gym once a week can make a huge difference over time.

Ahh I’ve noticed that too actually! When it’s really hot, I feel more anxious because I guess my body is imitating what it feels like when I’m anxious, so my brain believes I am. There’s probably some anatomical explanation, like how the sympathetic nervous system releases chemicals for our fight-or-flight response. I don’t really know of any possible solutions tho.. I guess you have to just find ways to cool yourself down, or maybe some type of breathing exercise. I hope this gives some insight, or at least makes you feel less alone.

I really don't know what you should do in your situation, because you seem to be stucked... For exemple it's makes me really sad that you don't study the things that makes you happy... Plus I think that medicine is really long to study... Really I don't know, for me you should study economics because if you study medecine now, maybe you'll not have the life that you wanted, etc... But if you did that, you will have to give up medecine and it's not easy to change a study parcours, plus your (really mean, excuse me for the term but it's the truth) parents would be soooo mad at you... 

If I were you I would speak with someone like a psychologist or idk (but I think it's expensive... So maybe try to find a trusted adult that you know, or maybe you would find free nums on the internet with experienced people, because I'm young, I don't have the experience and I'm a bit dumb/stupid so...)

"Started my first full time job as a barista today and it was going fine until I had to take orders. My colleagues were clearly getting frustrated with me bc I kept messing up during a lunch rush. I was sent to go do something else off tills to make it easier for them but I took it to heart I guess and got so overwhelmed. I went to to the back and just started hyperventilating and crying, I felt like I was going to pass out.  
My manager found me mid panic attack and was really nice, trying to calm me down but I was so humiliated.  
I’ve never reacted like this in public before. Usually I can hold it in, but I think everything built up and just spilled out. I’m so embarrassed that this had to happen on my first day. I hate to imagine what my coworkers and manager now think of me.  
I just feel like I’m never going to be normal. I’ve carried this feeling with me my whole life that everyone hates me and finds me annoying."	ratcroc	post	21.845952675847727	female	White	0.9993845224380493	na	na	na	31	socialanxiety
"You should be proud of yourself for getting out there and starting the job to begin with. A barista position is probably the hardest job for multitasking and doings things on the spot, give it a go but I'd definitely recommend something else. 

I just started a new job at a clothes store in the stockroom and I'm slow to start off with and the honeymoon phase with the manager is over now, I can see she's already annoyed with me, but you're putting yourself in these scary social situations, it's really brave, when a lot of others wouldn't even have turned up on the first day.

"I’m sorry about what happened. I actually started a new position as a waiter a couple days ago and the learning curve has been pretty steep. I know that what I’m about to say is probably something you have heard dozens of times by now but: this is completely normal. I have my second shift tomorrow and it’ll be my first one where I’m kind of on my own. Am I extremely nervous of messing up? 100%. But there’s a couple of things I’m trying to remind myself:

-I find that for me I struggle with being the new guy. I hate knowing that everyone else knows what to do/how to do their job adequately except for me. But I remind myself that literally every single person working was once new at some point. That may have been 10 years ago or 10 months ago, it doesn’t really matter. What matters is accepting you’re going to have to be the new person in many different situations in life. 

-Stick with it. It feels weird for me to be telling you this because this position is literally my first job ever but I’m saying this to myself as well. Take it one day at a time and realize that within a couple months you’ll have the job down pat. Think about how nice it’ll be to go into work and just be able to do the things you need to with minimal help. 

-Celebrate the little things and realize people don’t care as much as you think they do. You went in and showed up. I know for me that was half the battle right there. I would’ve never thought that 5 months ago I would have a job now and I’m thankful for it now. Also, this is very hard to get into your brain, (at least it is for me) but people do not care as much as we think they do. Most people don’t even think about those types of things. People with social anxiety tend to overestimate how much people pay attention to them. I know I hate the feeling of being watched by my other coworkers because I’m afraid they’ll judge me but then I remind myself that even IF they did who cares? Why am I afraid of that? They have more important things to worry about than the way I do things. 

-Lastly, as cliche as this is, realize you’re not alone in feeling this way. I’m going in for my second shift tomorrow and I’m very scared. But I know that the more I isolate myself from uncomfortable situations the more I’ll regret that decision down the road. Just think about the many other people who have felt/feel the same way you and I are feeling in our new jobs. 

I apologize if I misunderstood your problem but hopefully this helps you a bit. ❤️"	ratcroc	reply	na	na	na	0.9993845224380493	strong	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
First of all I’m proud of you for getting through it. I had the same thing happen to me. It’ll get better. It sounds like your manager was understanding so that’s a great sign.

Exact same thing happened to me a while back. I had a panic attack on my first day as a waitress because I screwed up an order and felt overwhelmed managing multiple tables. Even though everyone was really nice and supportive about it, I was so embarrassed and super nervous about my second day. But no one ever treated me differently or even brought it up, and I ended up working there for a long time.	ratcroc	reply	na	na	na	0.9993845224380493	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"Hello, Friend! I just wanted to tell you that I am extremely proud of you for taking this huge step into the working field. When I was 15, I got my first job working at a Dollar Store and I was too nervous and afraid of working at the cash register. I tried it a few times and kept messing up and getting confused, then begged my manager to let me only stalk the shelves. I hated that job and didn't last long. My second job was with a cleaning company and the job it's self was fine but the lady who ran the company wasn't the nicest. Third job was at ""the Golden arches"". I took on a cashier job... and how you've described your experience was exactly how I felt when I first started. I want to tell you, that continuing to show up is going to make a world of difference. You will start to catch on. It should be expected that any new employee is going to make a mistakes and take time to get used to things. You're probably doing better than you realize.... but besides that. I would want you to continue to hold on because this barista job is going to give you the basics for learning time-management and multi-tasking skills and I absolutely promise you, you will get the hang of it and you will be happy you held on. Once you've become comfortable, you will flourish. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and have moments of self-doubt, but I promise... you're not doing as bad as you think."	ratcroc	reply	na	na	na	0.9993845224380493	strong	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

might be biased since im an anxious ass bitch, but if I was working and saw someone having a breakdown I'd feel immediately empathetic. I'm kind of like you (a silent sufferer) and for some reason I carry a lot of shame and guilt around this disorder. Most people in my life don't even know when im having an anxious episode (socially). I just go to the closest bathroom. It's embarrassing and makes me feel weak and pathetic. But I noticed that no one has actually ever made me feel this way either with their words or just energy. Most of the time, people want to help. Anxiety is more common than it feels. Believing you are a nuisance that everyone hates, will only feed the heavy dark cloud that is social anxiety, and make it heavier and darker. I can't speak from experience, because I hardly let anyone know when im feeling anxiety, but I noticed that the times ive mentioned it, people don't judge me. Those that do(privately), just don't understand. AND THATS OK. fuck em. they don't pay me, or need to love me. You're valid! and fucken courageous as shit to get that job! Good for you!!

Baristas are held to such high standards for speed, accuracy, and friendliness. It's like social anxiety boot camp.

So if you want to get desensitized to stress and socialization, this is definitely the job. But it's gonna hurt. Pretty brutal way to get molded into more of an assertive and talkative person, but it will definitely toughen and loosen you up after a while. It's just up to you if you want to do it this way. 


Jobs I've had that toughened me up but are less nightmarish than barista work:

-cashier at a grocery store. Not as much of a rush, not as sweaty, always a supervisor to come fix problems you're having.

-gas station clerk. Fast paced but lots of down time. Random mean/chaotic/unstable customers, which will test your patience and emotional stability. 

-call center, like customer support for insurance, credit cards, roadside assistance, etc. Definitely can be pretty stressful but at least there's no one physically in your face and you don't get sweaty and dirty. Also there are always supervisors to help/take over if necessary."	ratcroc	reply	na	na	na	0.9993845224380493	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
You have to remember humans have empathy. Just because something happened doesn’t mean everyone hates you now. How would you feel if someone had a panic attack and was very distressed? Would you hate them or would your heart go out to them and you would want to help them or at least make them feel more comfortable? Just be you. If your struggle with anxiety or panic attacks. It’s okay. What I mean is, if you can’t do something like press a button and make it go away. Then the only option is to live with it for the time being. So acknowledge that and just try to live, be kind and whenever you struggle just know there isn’t anything you can do with you anxiety and panic attacks in the moment. It’s not like you chose it. Therefore try to just be decent to others and Hoe for the same back. Also know there are evil people out there, so it doesn’t surprise you when you inevitably come across one. I think sometimes our pain makes us bitter. And our bitterness makes us come across as dicks. I know this is true because it happens with me. Sometimes I’m cold and distant because of the pain and burden on my mind. I try to resist but sometimes it’s just too damn hard to be jolly or to put a smile on my face.	ratcroc	reply	na	na	na	0.9993845224380493	weak	no	strong	na	socialanxiety

You’re not a loser. I did the exact same thing with my past jobs and I chose to work early mornings as an online assistant. All I had to do was pack people’s orders in the warehouse and I could avoid everyone and didn’t have to speak. Social anxiety is so isolating and as a result I’m incredibly lonely so I completely understand. Things will get better I promise. I’m only 22 but I’ve slowly started to understand that even since being a teenager, things i worry about in social situations really don’t matter. I still struggle a lot obviously, but I tell myself that it takes so much time, practice and most importantly a lot of patience with yourself. I’m still trying to work on this.

I think you should apply! I also applied to Starbucks and had an interview, I didn’t get the job though. I then got my current job afterwards which is pretty similar (I work in Costa in the UK, not sure where you’re based but costa is very similar to Starbucks as it has a huge chain of stores too).

"Hi everyone. Im a 23 year old women and genuinely cannot tell if I'm attractive or not. I have never been in a relationship or even been kissed and I can't tell if it's due to my looks or other factors (shyness, extreme social anxiety that JUST  started getting SLIGHTLY better, remote work, online school since the age of 19, etc).

Some things that sometimes make me think I'm attractive is that strangers usually compliments me. For example, a couple times random girls my age or older came up and said ""you're so pretty I had to tell you."" I also get complimented a lot of my hair and outfits by women. Occasionally men will compliment me and say I look great today or something but not that often. Friends of friends have talked about how pretty I am behind my back to other girls. But most of my compliments overall are from girls and maybe they're just being nice?

On dating apps I get a lot of likes. But when I set my location to my area (NYC) and notice I get less likes than when I set it to other major cities. I only use Hinge and while I do get a good amount of likes a lot of the comments I get are really disturbing and are basically describing SA-ing me in detail.

Some proof I think there is that makes me think I'm not attractive is that when I go to bars or parties and stuff (or when I used to I haven't been to one since in over 2 years) all my friends would get approached by guys and I wouldn't so it made me think I might be ugly. I'm also EXTREMELY shy and think maybe I can come across standoffish but still not being asked out or approached made me feel like maybe I'm not attractive. I've only been to around 3 parties and 2 bars total though.I also didn't go on my first date until I was 22 (which was a couple months ago) and got ghosted right after. I met him off a dating app. The same thing happened on the 2nd date I ever went out. So I got ghosted by 2/2 first dates so far which makes me think maybe I am unattractive.

Are there any other ways to tell if you are attractive or not? It just drives me crazy that I can't tell and the lack of experience makes me think maybe I'm ugly and people are just being nice to me. It's making my social anxiety so much worse to not know and preventing me from dating."	Girlygirlypop	post	19.683333277870513	male	White	0.9985243678092957	na	na	na	54	socialanxiety

"I think social anxiety makes people think in an overly binary, absolute way. Like this post; you're juggling whether you're OBJECTIVELY pretty or OBJECTIVELY ugly. The best compromise is to just accept the middle ground truth; you're attractive to some people and not attractive to others.

Yes your features could somehow align to conventional beauty standards, but that doesn't mean strangers / people will respond to you in a prescribed, consistent pattern of behaviour like:

* ""oh if I'm attractive, I HAVE to be complimented all the time, given attention""
* ""If I'm ugly, people have to treat me horribly and like I'm invisible"" etc

They can treat you either way, and it has nothing to do with your appearance sometimes.

I struggle from this as well. I am conventionally attractive I think, but I overthink social cues, and try to sniff out consistent patterns in behaviour to solidify the fact whether I'm attractive or not attractive, when most of the time there isn't any / it's not going to be easily observable.

"First, never let other people determine your self-worth. The amount of likes on your dating profile and whether or not someone approaches you at a bar shouldn’t be your gauge for how attractive you are. 


Second, attractiveness is just a small part of dating and relationships. IMO compatibility is more important.



Are you putting yourself in a position to meet people and get to know them? If so, have you shown signs that you’re interested in them? It’s quite intimidating to ask someone out if they don’t seem open to it or you don’t have anything in common. 



You don’t need to wait for people to approach you either. I know it’s scary, but you’ll feel more in control if you take the initiative. What helps is not talking to people with the intention of dating them. That puts a lot of pressure on you and can trigger your SA/ impact your self-esteem. Just get to know them as a person with no expectations. If you connect, keep in touch and it could turn into a relationship if both of you guys are on the same page. 


Instead of worrying about what other people perceive of you, ask yourself:

-What do YOU want in a partner? (Looks, values, hobbies/interests, aspirations)

There’s no such thing as “objectively attractive” as beauty is subjective. There will be a bunch of people who think you’re attractive, average, and even some that think you’re not not good looking.

I desperately want to be seen as objectively attractive, most likely because I feel like I have to make up for being myself, if that makes any sense. However, no matter what you look like, not everyone will find you attractive, so that's an unachievable goal. If I suddenly became the most attractive person in the world, my confidence would still crumble the moment I got rejected once. All we can do is accept that it's subjective and work on the things we *can* change. I'm still struggling with that myself, but this seems to be the way.

"'Objectively attractive' is such a difficult thing to quantify though.

You are definitely going to be attractive enough to not disqualify you from meaningful & fulfilling relationships (or flings if you find that more appealing).

"I didn't get into my first relationship until around 23.. first of all theres nothing wrong with you or getting into relationships in a later timeline of your life. Real connections are hard to come by ... I was like you though, I thought having social anxiety made me unlovable & I distinctly remember thinking ""wow, someone really loves me DESPITE my anxiety""  my first relationship was bad/abusive though because I didn't know my worth & the guy was able to manipulate me.

Might sound cliché to you but self love is where you should start investing, it'll bring you the right people & help you decipher between which guys are even worth your time.

When you're looking for other people to validate your attractiveness or worthiness it lowkey puts you at their mercy. You might put up with BS from that person because you'll think no one else thinks your attractive & insecure (manipulative) guys absolutely love that & will prey upon your insecurities.. these are hard lessons I had to learn because from my teens to mid twenties bc my self esteem was on the floor & I was constantly looking for validation that I was lovable from guys who themselves weren't even worth it.. 

Once I started knowing my OWN worth and knowing that I AM a beautiful & worthy woman my life started getting better and I finally met a guy who treats me how I deserve.

"So I (19f) work with children (3-5s) and was having a chat with my mum about how I would deal with a tantrum. We were talking about one child in particular who frequently has tantrums and I was explaining that I was able to quickly calm them down and get them playing again without any of the other children or staff really noticing. My mum then said that when I was little I only had a few tantrums and the last one I ever had was really bad. She then said that she told me that everyone was watching me and everyone was looking at me (I had a tantrum in the middle of a shop) and that they all thought I was a little brat. Apparently I stopped immediately and never did it again. Now I have no recollection of this. Or any of my childhood/ teen years.

Anyways fast forwards to now and I have pretty bad social anxiety. Like I have most, if not all the symptoms and I’ve taken the tests numerous times and they all come back with off the chart levels of anxiety. I always thought that my anxiety came from an incident that happened when I was a bit older. But now I’m thinking it stems from this situation.

Well the way I see it, you stop noticing these things once you actually do something about them. If you are not preferred then take action because it might be because you don’t try to make someone prioritize you. Just the way people are — they want the best, but that doesn’t mean you are lacking. I’d say go out, be in a good position financially, get ripped, and you will have confidence for yourself. Overall just find what makes you feel fulfilled and valued. Because in the end no one will do these things for us.

"The problem is caring TOO much. SA is a mind F— that simply is not reality. It’s like having schizophrenia. Your mind is designing a fake world that is making you believe it’s real. 

If you are a negative or pessimistic person, you counter that by chanting positive affirmations. To not give a F— you have to start feeding your mind the same thing.

For example, I struggle at instructing group fitness because of my SA. Not because I don’t have the skills to but my confidence always takes a hit when I start believing people are judging me when they are watching me. Maybe they are in a way. But I’ve looked at my pay and after what I pay out in gas, training, food I figured if I’m lucky I’m making $5 a class. So I tell myself that.

"I used to be exactly like this and now I’m almost the opposite lol, I don’t have the energy to care about what people think anymore.

What helped me was to think like this: If I saw someone else do this thing, would it lower my opinion of them? (ex. The classroom is deadly quiet and a girl crosses the room to get a tissue and starts blowing kinda loudly. Would you think she’s gross or embarrassing or annoying? Probably not, unless you’re extremely judgmental which I doubt.) 99% of the time, people could care less about the little things you do, and the 1% of people that do care aren’t worth worrying about. Those people are either super judgmental (so their opinions shouldn’t mean anything to you) or they have a crush on you lol (what they think of you is their problem, not yours). 

I hope this helps, you need to allow yourself to just exist and to do normal things like everyone else.

"Makes me think of the saying ""we suffer more in imagination than reality"". Think about anyone you dislike. Do you share any of their behaviours or values? Probably not, right? After all, people that are disliked usually aren't concerned about how they are effecting other people, so just having the thought people hate you is good evidence that it's not the case. I think us people with SAD can often view others indifference towards us as hatred, when really it's not that they hate us, just they haven't got a chance to know us very well. And can we blame them when most of the time we neglect their needs because we're so consciously worrying about ourself? I'd bet the most you've ever felt like people liked you, is when you were least conscious of your own behaviours, and more tuned into the environment and people around you. The older I get, the more I realise everyone has their own things going on, and no one is deconstructing your behaviour even 5% as much as you are yourself."

"Ah, the joys of perception. Arational thinking is really a whole hell of a something to deal with.

That’s the fun part of it, since the belief is not based in reason but rather based in perception, critical thinking won’t really do a whole lot to change it, because you can’t quite rationalize your way into not seeing something that is sitting right in front of your eyes now can you ? We assign meaning to things we see, and that’s not a problem if your perception is actually doing its job properly, we see a tiger and we immediately think of danger, that’s great, because reason wouldn’t be able to do that, critical thinking is too slow, too doubtful, perception does not doubt itself, that is its strength but it’s also where the problem comes from because when perception starts to imagine and over interpret things then it’s when we start to get into hot water.

"I used to be a quite outgoing child. I remember having the courage to dance in front of a band at a restaurant when my mom said I should. As I got older I started to get a little shy but still enjoyed to participate in theatre and musicals with my friends in middle school . I don’t know how I was able to do it. I only felt comfortable talking with friends. I still remember being quite shy at the time.As I reached high school I joined the theatre but only with a few lines I was terrified. And after that year I noticed I developed severe social anxiety. And now I get nervous just asking someone a question. (It takes me a lot to do so). I hardly ever talk now. I am so shy. I’ve been thinking about it a lot and I don’t understand how I was able to do those plays as a child as well as why my social anxiety is so severe now.

this describes me pretty much perfectly, i was quite extroverted and loud up until around 11 12 ish but when high school started i all of a sudden became very anxious and as you describe looking back at that kid that was outgoing and could actually talk in a group of people instead of just kind of stand there awkwardly like i did in high school. it almost felt alien, like it wasnt even me. i think it has to do with the brain developing and we start to become more self aware and think more about the impact of what we say and how other people view us. it seems to hit people in varying degrees and it seems like we got the short end of the stick unfortunately. both me and my mum are very socially anxious people and so i think there is definately a genetic role at play but also it could have to to with the household and if you experienced any trauma as a child, that could cause you experience what feels like almost constant fight or flight and be very tense and hyper aware in even just normal social situations. hope this give you some insight :)	Mobile_Company_5029	reply	na	na	na	0.9984225034713745	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
Yeah pretty much. I was outgoing until high school. I think I was just unfortunate in that I wasn't put in any classes with my old friends. New social circles started to form but I wasn't properly in any of them. Just sorta on the edge of a few. I think if I had done one of two little things differently then I would have transitioned normally into a new friendship group and my life would be completely different now. It wouldn't have taken much. Instead I just steadily lost confidence.	Mobile_Company_5029	reply	na	na	na	0.9984225034713745	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
also i should mention that i was put on pregabalin by my psychiatrist and i have found it to be quite effective at making me more open and chatty in social settings. its also not as abuse prone as something like benzos which are a lot more euphoric so i hear. also i dont get that zombie effect that people describe feeling from some anxiety medications, it just feels a bit like the social confidence boost you get from drinking alcohol but minus the actual drunk part.

yes!! music is such a freeing form of expression, and it’s a beautiful thing to share with other people. performances seem super scary at first, but once you do it and realize that you’re not going to be the only one that’s heard, it gets easier. the best way to help get over anxiety is to do things that make you anxious, so this is a great opportunity for you to do that. please try it out, if it doesn’t work out for you, you can always quit later. band can be such a wonderful experience, and I hope you can find yourself loving it. the saxophone is also a great instrument to start on imo, it’s a lot easier to learn than some of the other ones.

I definitely agree, our thoughts are powerful.

But since I stopped telling myself that, I hardly notice those things at all. If we believe a certain thing, we’ll find pieces of evidence to prove it, even if those pieces of evidence are actually irrelevant or don’t make that strong of an argument.

I walked into work the other day and three of my co workers were just hanging out having a conversation. My inner self wants so badly to be able to say hey what’s up guys and automatically join the conversation and walk over to them. Instead I see them they all say hey and I just quietly say hi then walk into the other room. After a few minutes I returned to where they were and quietly sat down not knowing when to interject into their conversation. I felt so awkward sitting there and kept thinking about how they must think I’m so awkward. Then another co worker walks in and she does exactly what I wish I could do, she greets them confidently says hey what’s up guys how’s it going what are we talking about and sits down to join the group. I eventually was able to find a spot to I join the conversation but I still felt so awkward and anxious. This happened a week ago and I’m still replaying it in my head. I’m fine talking one on one with people even if I don’t know them but the second there’s a group of people I feel like I’m the odd one out, I don’t know when to interject in conversations, I feel like the comments I add to conversations are useless and stupid.

I’ve been going to the gym for about a year now and I totally get it. I was terrified of going before because I was super skinny and scrawny, and could hardly lift anything. First off gyms are some of the most welcoming places out there. All I got was encouragement and good advice from the people there when I first started going. I’ve never felt anyone judge me for only lifting a few pounds and I actually ended up making friends. The lifting community is super supportive and really cool the vast majority of the time .Something I found that helps ease my anxiety about not knowing anything was watching a lot of YouTube videos about how to work out. There is a boatload of amazing information on YouTube about the gym I like how to use machines what exercises are the best how to make splits nutrition and everything else. Seriously if you don’t know how to use the machine, I guarantee you there’s a YouTube video of someone demonstrating exactly how to use it. If you’re still worried about not being able to lift much I would highly recommend doing a 2 to 3 weeks calisthenics training routine. Something easy you can do at home that just involves things like push-ups crunches and other bodyweight exercises. They are also a ton of videos on YouTube on how to do calisthenics. That should help you get a bit stronger pretty quickly and I’ll definitively boost your confidence when you want to go.	tetrisvisions	reply	na	na	na	0.9983614087104797	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

Must say that what is not helping is that I don't find a lot of things funny and til 2 years ago I hadn't had a real laugh for three years.

I am so focused on trying to find a joke that I search for the most logical thing and don't let myself be, so the delivery of said joke is.. bad

My social anxiety is really affecting my work life and ability to form new friendships, I am 29 and I have moved to Australia from the UK with my girlfriend and I’m really struggling to make new friends and get on in work - I wasn’t always socially anxious, the exact opposite til I was 21, I loved being with crowds and being the centre of attention, I had been smoking a lot of weed from about 19 and my friends told me I’d gone weird which I think is the roo cause of it, I’m always watching what I’m saying - I haven’t smoked weed now for 6 years and I don’t really get social anxiety if it’s just me and one other person - what can I do to work on this?

"Hey everyone. Bit of a rant here.

So something I've always struggled with is initiating a conversation. But I love talking to people. And every once in a while I find the right person who starts first, we can talk for a while and it's great and just feels natural. And after a while of getting to know them, only then will I be comfortable being a convo starter, and by then we're pretty much friends.

But these type of people seem to be very rare. Most people I have come across at school and work etc, seem to wait for me to start, resulting in awkward convos. Even when I know for a fact they are a very outgoing person (by seeing how they talk to others). 

For example, when I started one of my last jobs, I did not get a very warm welcome. People were nice enough sure, but mainly only talked to me when it was about work. I even try extra hard putting myself out there whenever starting a new job or whatever, but it never seems to work. Am I wrong in thinking it should be up to the workers already there to do the initiating and making me feel welcome? I'm the new one! Even for those without SA, starting a new job and meeting new people is a bit scary and people may be a bit shy, so I've never understood this. 

It even sometimes kind of happens with extended family members at family gatherings. Not as bad, but there are a few awkward silences, and I always get the feeling it's up to me to keep it going. But whatever, I don't see those people often anyway so no big deal.

I don't see how I could be doing anything wrong. I am always very friendly and try to make myself look approachable, I'm always clean and well groomed, and have great oral hygiene etc, so I have no idea why this is happening. Have I just had bad luck with the people I've met/am related to?

Anyone else have a similar experience to this?

Shoutout to the very few awesome people out there who make the effort to talk first to SA people. You guys rule."	Gamba_Kufu_of_Huru	post	16.48862597772379	male	White	0.013148289173841476	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety

"Ever feel like sometimes your social anxiety just makes you selfish? 

I get panic attacks just imagining that I have to attend a relative's funeral in 2 days. Even tried to explain it to my parents but of course, they don't think it's a reasonable excuse. (I don't blame them, I think that way too)

I just cannot imagine having to go to funerals just so relatives could terrorize me as to what's going on with my life, why i'm not married yet, or get unsolicited advice about my acne.

Last time i attended my grandmother's funeral, I got called out by an older relative about not wanting to remove my face mask for a ""photo op"" with my cousins. 

It's like I want to grieve and sympathize with them but I really cannoooot bear to go through all that.

I just want to be hospitalized just so i could finally have a ""reasonable"" excuse as to why i cannot attend."	Serious_Advantage_98	post	34.13480758300553	female	White	0.9991297125816345	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety

"You have to go into the root cause of social anxiety. Suppressing symptoms won't help you in the long run.

We are socially anxious because for some reason we can't accept ourselves as we are. Maybe bad experiences in the past. Because of that, we have to seek that acceptance outside of us and going into new situation having no idea if the other person will accept us or not, causes the anxiety.

So what you have to do is to stop pleasing others. Accepting that some people like you as you are, some people don't and thats how it goes. Learn to build a bridge between your inner world and outer world. Act as you feel. This way you become authentic and you find that confidence. There is no other way. Our confidence and power comes from the inside but we cant access that unless we accept ourselves fully as we are.

The girl that prepared my order gave me extra napkins to clean myself and refilled my juice and said it was fine when I insisted in paying  for it and didn't seem angry or anything but god I'm an idiot and so clumsy this is why I never go out.

If you want to be happy, you have to let go of the part of you that wants to create melodrama. This is the part that thinks there’s a reason not to be happy. You have to transcend the personal, and as you do, you will naturally awaken to the higher aspects of your being. In the end, enjoying life’s experiences is the only rational thing to do. You’re sitting on a planet spinning around in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Go ahead, take a look at reality. You’re floating in empty space in a universe that goes on forever. If you have to be here, at least be happy and enjoy the experience. You’re going to die anyway. Things are going to happen anyway. Why shouldn’t you be happy? You gain nothing by being bothered by life’s events. It doesn’t change the world; you just suffer. There’s always going to be something that can bother you, if you let it.

"So I’m ass at social interactions, I never know what to do and I’m horribly awkward and it makes me feel worthless in social situations. But I’m trying to change that by taking baby steps, irl is too much for me so I made a profile on this website for dating and/or finding friends, there’s no pressure to put yourself in your pfp (which I have not done) there but I’m scared shitless to reach out to people and I’m tempted to delete my account. Also to clarify I’m not there for dating, just to practice my social skills and maybe make friends. 

My account has my city/name listed on it and you can see anyone around the world and I’ve had it basically drilled into me to never share personal information online and it’s lowkey scaring the fuck out of me. Nobody could find me with what I listed but it’s still horrifying to me.  

Anyways there’s a few people there that I really do want to talk to or at least like their profiles but I’m terrified of coming off as a creep despite that literally being one of the main functions of the website. I can’t even do a little step and just message someone without being convinced they think I’m a freak and a creep, or that they hate me.

"I had a family reunion this weekend. My cousin(28f) was there. She's just like me, has lots of social anxiety. I just basically shut up and listen when I'm around my family as my anxiety basically makes me freeze up and my brain turns off, I can barely utter any words. My cousin is the opposite. She talks when she's nervous. She appears to be extroverted, but inside she can't stand being around people and she relieves it by saying anything that pops into her head. She interrupts people and goes on too long about details of her friends or her job that people don't find interesting. I for one, love her. I love hanging out with her because I get her and I also don't have as much pressure to talk because she does it all. I think she's such a lovely but flawed person, aren't we all?

Anyway, my family doesn't think that way. They think something is wrong with her. After she left for the airport home, it only took about an hour before my dear old dad started a conversation with my cousin's dad and brother (who were there) about how they need to talk to her about talking too much. He said they need to fix her. They agreed and said they try but she ends up getting her feelings hurt (duh). They then pointed me out and said I'm the polar opposite of her. I wonder what they say about me when I'm not around? 

That's one of the main reasons why I'm so quiet around my family. They like to talk shit about people behind their back. I can't do that. I don't do that. I see the beauty in every person. They see the ugly and they think it's funny. So, I usually have nothing to contribute to their conversations. They also talk a lot about sports and family members I've never even met, and how much they dislike the world. It's just exhausting. They can also be very fun and there's never any drama between people, but they so easily talk behind someone's back and I just don't have the energy to be around people like that. 

They asked me to talk to my cousin about changing her ways. I am going to talk to my cousin. I'm going to tell her how much I enjoyed her company and that if she ever needs a shoulder to cry on or someone to vent to, then I'm always there for her.

"Not to defend them or anything, but hate speech often comes from plain ignorance. They do not understand what it's like, either because they have not the condition nor firsthand experience with someone close who does (family, friends, partners). As much as we can only say so much for whatever life is for other people, they should not be so quick to speak definitively on something they have little to no knowledge of.

Now for the vitriol behind her comments: some people have a nasty attitude to anything that rubbed them the wrong way. And that's often on them because ""hurt people, hurt \[other\] people."" For all we know, she had some prior misgiving with someone who has SA, so now she paints everyone else with the same, broad strokes. Honestly quite lazy not try and evaluate it, much less empathise with those who do try their level best to cope and function in spite of SA.

"She just doesn't understand. Like the other comments said, there will always be people like this with dumb opinions.  Also, she's probably insecure in her own right or just ignorant or possibly got hurt or was made uncomfortable or frustrated by someone who had social anxiety. Which I know sucks because the person experiencing the social anxiety is going through way more discomfort. But it's still understandable that the other person might feel uncomfortable too.

It takes either someone kind, someone who understands the struggles of anxiety, or even a therapist to really be empathetic about this kind of thing. It's really not a surprise that there will be people that don't get it.

Also, don't forget that introverts talk trash about extroverts too. People just like to vent sometimes. If I were you, I would just block this person and not read their posts anymore. Someone with this opinion is not worth any of our time.

If it really bothers you, you could consider responding and letting her know that she's being offensive and ignorant. Though this probably would just create more stress for you.

Aah I have a story for you about my job interview today, at a traineeship. I have a lot of anxiety going to an interview, especially the first few minutes, and I often get a sweaty forehead. So my interviewee says I should get some papers and solve it. After that, slowly but surely, I got better and more calm and talked really well about myself. These things need practice and luck that the one on the opposite side supports you. Maybe you're the quiet one, but you might still have shown you are capable for the job, or they might even need a quiet one who works hard and doesn't complain. I am proud of you that you went to the interview and know that a lot more people are more nervous about these horrible things than you think.	ivyhyung	reply	na	na	na	0.9881390929222107	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

Ego thing / power dynamic establishment. People doing this was my biggest set back while i was overcoming s’a. They thrive off feeling superior & its a really ugly trait to have. Ignore them & they hold no power over you, but to someone who struggles with interactions, feeling criticized is extremely difficult to get through.

Despite being moderately socially anxious, highly introverted, and shy (indeed, not the luckiest combo), I enjoyed socializing with people.

I had a group of close friends and many wonderful memories shared with them, but these friendships fell apart during the pandemic isolation.

Finding new friends now feels impossible. As another user pointed out, ""It's like there's an entirely different world full of fun and amazing stuff that's not open to you."" I agree. I experienced it, but now the gate has closed with no way out.

Hey, I have social anxiety and I absolutely crave socialization. I agree that it’s a whole new world of fun activities. This is where I get my motivation to get out of my comfort zone. I am extroverted so I will almost cry at school when I can’t socialize enough. Even not being fully myself around others still helps me feel better. I made an achievement a few days ago where I asked a nerdy awkward kid for his number. It’s not much because we barely talked.

It can be a lot of fun! But man is it draining! I have definitely been guilty of not wanting to do things and then doing them anyway and having a great time. But there's always a price.

Yeah I relate a lot on experiencing both worlds even with social anxiety.

"How do people do normal things in public, and seemingly not worry about what other people perceive of them or what they may be thinking? 

Everyday I see people on the bus checking their emails, social media, reading books, texting friends etc with no effort to hide what they are doing. I can’t seem to do this. I don’t want to take certain books out to read in public for fear of what others may think, I turn my brightness down on my phone so no one can see what I’m doing on there, and if someone sits or stands close to me I get extremely paranoid that they can see what I’m doing or are judging me for it, even if it’s not negative judgement. I’m not doing anything bad on my phone, but I feel I physically can’t even do a normal thing like check my email or go on social media. The mere fact that another individual is perceiving what I’m doing and thinking about it makes me extremely anxious. 

I attend university, and it’s the same situation there. I see other students in the row in front of me checking their messages, online shopping etc while I sit there with all my notifications turned off, unable to have anything personal open on my laptop aside from the set academic reading even if I’m bored or not paying attention in class and might want to do those other things people are doing. 

I know no one cares about what I’m doing, and in reality when I see someone doing something I may consider it for a moment but forget about it immediately after because it isn’t important to me. But I just can’t seem to apply these same rules to myself.

"I had to practice to be able to sing publicly.  I started at Boston Common.  First, I wore sunglasses while I sang and looked at the tip of my nose, so I couldn't see anyone or their reactions.  I just focused on enjoying the experience of singing.

When I felt OK with that, I tried looking out the sunglasses at people walking by while I sang.  Eventually I got comfortable enough to not need sunglasses and I was able to sing at some open mic nights.  I still sing sometimes on my Twitch stream.

"I have some tricks, that may help you.

For vocals:  
If you have a car, drive it and sing along to your favourite songs (that are within your vocal-range). With more practice, you'll gain more experience .. and thus you'll become more confident about your vocal-skills. And nobody will be able to hear you when you make a mistake.

For guitars:  
There are those little headphone-amps for electric guitars (I've seen cheap ones, that give you amp simulations, effects and that can act as an audio-interface on top of it all .. you can't go wrong with something like that).  
Same principle. Nobody can hear you. So, you can practice, until you're confident about your guitar-skills without anyone even taking notice.

"I logged onto facebook last night and saw the huge announcement that my niece was engaged.  I knew this day was coming because this girl only posts about her guy on FB, gushing about him for years almost every single day.   Like do I need to see another daily reminder just how wonderful your life is with the perfect man?  Her engagement announcement looked almost like the wedding.  The families were there (I wasn't invited  but I live in another state) for a big surprise party at a special venue.   She posted over 30 photos of the happy occasion and of  course, got hundreds of congratulations replies.

&#x200B;

Instead of feeling happy for her, I feel kinda pissed.  Partly because I'm going to have to go through the hassle and social discomfort of attending which will probably be a huge wedding.  But also the contrast with my depressing life and seeing them experience things in life that social anxiety has robbed from me.  I've been alone most of my life.  I don't have a significant other to gush about me.  No one ever threw a party for me, and outside of my parents, no one in my family has offered to help me one bit with problems.  My siblings only contact me if there is a father gathering.  As for my niece, she only says a few words to me at Christmas.  She's pretty much a stranger to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It kinda reminds of a scene in Captain America CW where Iron Man says to Cap that sometimes I just want to punch you in your perfect teeth.  I don't think it's so much feelings of jealousy, but more of her throwing right in people's face on FB about her wonderful fairy tale life.  It comes off really obnoxious.And I'm suppose to join the masses and give her praise and well wishes when nothing good every happens to me?  Why does life have to be so unbalanced?  She has hundreds of friends, tons of support and a sister that would do anything for her.  I would be happy just to have one good friend.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Course I could never say any of this to my family because I do sound like a massive jerk for having these feelings and maybe I am.  Funny thing is I could tell my dad wasn't thrilled having to go this party just for a freaking engagement announcement but he felt obligated to do so.

It's okay that it doesn't make you feel good, that's because of your illness. I hope you are seeking therapy though, it's not something you have to live with.

Coming from a jealous person, I think you are jealous. Which is totally natural and understandable. Social anxiety can feel like you're watching everyone live their best lives while you have none. BTW you don't have to go to the wedding. I'm not close to my cousins or most of my family and I know they only invite me to weddings because they feel that they have to so now I just decline. Never again will I spend my money, energy and time on going to a wedding surrounded mainly by people I don't know and sit there uncomfortably for hours and not even see the couple for more than a minute anyway. Say you can't get out of work or if you don't work, say you're having health problems and aren't up to a big social gathering.

Taking someone else's good news as a personal attack is definitely on you.

"I’m sorry OP.

It’s hard seeing other people celebrate life milestones on social media. Especially when they’re younger than you and you feel like you’ve “missed out” or “are behind” in life. I quit social media about a year and a half ago and never looked back. When I want to know about people’s lives, I’ll reach out (it forces me to be social too). Passively seeing everyone’s highlight reel everyday was a lot for my SA. 

Even though you aren’t super close to your niece, I’m sure she would appreciate your well wishes. If you were in her shoes, you’d probably want people to be happy for you. SA is an illness so I think it’s a bit unfair to expect people without SA to experience life like someone with SA.

Your feelings are understandable but I think you should also take it as inspiration to improve your life by slowly taking baby steps to lessening your social anxiety. I totally get feeling like you’ll end up alone because it’s hard to put yourself out there but you just have to push yourself a little bit at a time until you feel more comfortable talking to people and maybe even try to pursue dating if that’s something you desire.

When my brother tells me he hang out again with his mates, or when I am at my sister's place and I see all the photos of her and her friends. I try not to show it, but still it makes it hard to genuinely enjoy other people's successes, and I come off as cold and apathetic. I tell myself it is a natural reaction, but it doesn't help.

Just like how It’s the same as people who post too many selfies are usually the most insecure about their looks. That’s just how it is. 

OP may I ask how old you are? Her happiness doesn’t have to take anything away from you. It’s important to be happy for people because if you exert good energy it will come back to you. You can be happy and fulfilled without a significant other or without anyone else gushing on you. 

if you’re being triggered by the posts, then mute the offenders. Out of sight out of mind. Focus on yourself because you deserve that attention from yourself. Once you start treating yourself nicer other people with gravitate to you.

So I'm gonna be really harsh here, but only because I felt the *exact* same way when I was in my teens and early 20s, and this is what I would say to my past self. I was a self-centered, bitter, jealous little shit that was so trapped in my own head that I took everything that happened around me as a personal attack.

It's. Not. About. You. 

People are just living their lives. It's not a big deal. You need to become more of an unbiased observer.  Watch them like it's a TV show or something. Find some way to emotionally detach from it. 

You can't keep going through life being jealous of everyone that seems to have a better life than you. It's a nasty habit, an addiction, even. You're sabotaging yourself. 

You're so focused on what you don't have and what you can't do, and you need to be focused on what you *do* have and what you *can* do.

One day the bird's owner needs to clean the room, and decides it best to take the cage outside for the duration. While the bird is outside it sees other birds who have lived their entire lives in freedom, flying around carelessly, singing, bonding, etc. Suddenly the caged bird begins to feel very resentful of the free birds and begins judging them like a crochety elder; ""They shouldn't be showing off like that!""

I had a roommate who would regularly get into screaming matches with her boyfriend but post gushy love things about him all over social media. They're married now, and I wonder if they're still as miserable as when they were just dating.

Also consider the age gap -- if she's old enough to be getting married, she could have a different relationship with social media than you do. It might be more normal to post this kind of stuff in her generation than it is in yours.

But to me, it seems like those people are trying to desperately prove something to someone. If it bothers you so much, you can unfollow her on Facebook while still remaining friends.

This life is very short, and we have souls. We have the choice to go to heaven or hell, and I don’t want you to go to hell. Neither does Jesus, and that’s why He died for you and me. In heaven, there is no suffering, loneliness, depression, heartache, sickness, sin, or corruption. I pray you’d niece also has this hope, but if you don’t, please consider.

I agree with you 100%. Them saying that they’re mad at getting reminders of her happy life is making them upset. I can be like jealous like that sometimes. And with the social situation, weddings aren’t really that bad. I mean usually there’s family members that you should be close with. I’m close with obviously my parents but also my grandpa. So that’s usually who I talk to mostly. I usually talk to my aunts from here and there. I mean if someone was getting married and i was jealous i would just cover my jealousy because jealousy can be so toxic sometimes.

I agree with this. I’m worried about OP. I’ve felt similarly before, usually when I’m in a bad spot mentally. It’s easier to judge other people and find fault in them than it is to accept that you’re not happy. I feel a lot of love for OP though. I know that feeling and it hurts.

I wouldn't say I'm self centered in the negative scene.  More like, very self conscious around people which makes me feel weird and awkward.  I do care about people and like to help others.  I guess I just think those who life has rewarded with its riches should show empathy to those like me who can't get a damn break or has no one to help them. To me, it's like someone eating a delicious pizza right in front of a homeless starving person and the staving person is expected to be happy that they are enjoying their meal.

"This happened a year ago but I remembered it because it's ""profile pic season"" again (basically we're made to update our profile pictures at the start of the school year to ""promote"" or whatever). 

Almost everyone participates in updating their profile pics and I was pressured into doing it, but I felt horrible afterwards. I broke down in my bathroom shaking all over and I was hyperventilating like mad.

I vowed that day that I would never participate in these stupid Facebook blasts again, but it's made me wonder if by doing so I might be feeding my anxiety instead of learning to overcome it.

Sorry to hear that. You're not alone though. I feel the same whenever I want to post something, leave a comment or etc. I think it's the fear of getting judged. We just keep overthinking about how others perceive us, what are other's expectations & feeling anxious without their external validation. But in reality they prolly won't remember your post in like 2 minuts. And that's kinda a relief to know you're just a normal person like everyone & you deserve to have online social interactions same as every other user. Like that's the whole point of social media right?

"Sorry, that sound bad that you're feeling pressured by others. I know that feeling too well..

""But it's made me wonder if by doing so I might be feeding my anxiety instead of learning to overcome it""

I would never recommend to make something you really have high anxiety for, because It's a double edge sword. If it succeed you will feel very good about it, but if it failed it can be devastating for anxiety and it can make you want avoid going out of comfort zone, because brains will remember it and don't want to repet the highly stressed event.

What you should do instead is taking one baby step at a time to make you more used to the situation. I'll promise you It's the most comfortable and easiest way to improve! I used to have so severe anxiety that just going out from home seemed impossible.. If I just got out and something bad happend I would never set my foot at the door again.. But my first step was to go to backyard, then 5 min walk and then 10 min walk, etc.. I was so used to it, even if bad things happened, It didnt stop me from going outside.

A little/moderate anxiety is normal when trying overcome it but It sounds you're pushing yourself too hard to even got a panic attack, please don't be to hard on yourself as you shouldn't feel horrible afterwards and with high anxiety 🙁"	peach_blossoms25	reply	na	na	na	0.9992673993110657	strong	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

Most times, if you don’t post much it will just let people know you are still alive. That’s all. It’s not a big deal (Tell your mind).

28M. Lifelong lone wolf. I moved to another state recently and today I had to go out to town to have my license changed. As soon as I stepped in the office there stood the most drop dead naturally beautiful woman I think I've ever seen in person with my own two eyes. I heard her talking with one of the service people and she's from Ontario and she had the most soothing voice. Meanwhile I'm drenched from rain, decked in all black with my hair wet on my face and stammering in nervousness just from her presence trying to have my license changed. She was busy talking by the time I was done and it was pouring rain outside so hard I didn't stand around to wait or anything. Now I'm just horrifically depressed moreso than usual. I'm very lonely with no social interaction with anyone outside of work (even then it's rare). All I do is lift weights at home and hit tires with sledgehammers. I've been trying to mentally train myself to become aesexual or dull my attraction to the opposite sex because I figure if I can never have my desires or impulses fulfilled then why have them to begin with? But today that was completely shattered and now I'm brooding more than usual.	ImprovementPure1302	post	26.02699878982192	male	White	0.9980431795120239	na	na	na	3	socialanxiety

One day you’ll date someone who’s not outwardly pretty at first but they’ll grow on you till you think they’re the most pretty person on earth.

So long as I think I look like a freak, I’ll always be self conscious about my appearance. I cannot go anywhere without feeling like I’m drawing a lot of attention to myself. I don’t think it’s all in my head either, for many years I’ve had people make serial killer jokes about me. That I look very cold and unwelcoming, that I scare people. I wish those people never introduced the thought of me looking creepy into my head, I haven’t been the same ever since. Almost everyone that I meet seems very passive aggressive or dismissive towards me. A therapist won’t be able to change my appearance nor the opinions of others. Is my only choice to accept being a freak and learn to live with it? I don’t have any friends either and I’m sure my appearance has something to do with it.	throwaway18153	post	28.967310464770208	female	White	0.9969819188117981	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety
Here are some possibilities. Therapy can help you see that the people who told you you looked scary could have some (potentially very serious) problems themselves and said that either to be purposely shitty, or not trying to be mean but maybe you were going through an angry or sad period in your life where you felt down and this was reflected in your face, and they impulsively said that. When they made that comment, your mind latched onto it and thought “this is how people see me”, and began seeing it in all your interactions. A therapist can help you see that in fact most of this could be warped by the one comment and not based in reality at all. They could help you see that rather than choosing to continue to self isolate and entering a vicious circle, you can face these intimidating social interactions with self compassion (see dr kristin neff) and help yourself to thrive.	throwaway18153	reply	na	na	na	0.9969819188117981	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"Need to call my boss because school is starting soon and I can't work my usual shift (I only work once a week), and are only available on Wednesday and Fridays. I texted him, because we usually text, and explained my availability but he didn't respond. He usually responds straight away, in the 3 years I have worked here. I waited 3 days with no response and texted him again. There was no response this time either. My shift is coming up this week, and it's the same day as first day of school, and I can't work. Luckily I have  managed to get a coworker to change shifts with me for this week, but it hasn't been approved yet. Usually he does this within the next day, but it's day 2 now.

Now I'm starting to think he's ignoring me on purpose. I noticed that he put up the shifts for the coming weeks, but didn't approve the change in shifts, in the same system. It's just now pending.  I forced myself to call him today and it went to voicemail. Called half an hour later and it was the same. 

I'm going to call him again tomorrow, and if I don't get a response I'm thinking of texting the assistant manager to tell the boss to call me. 

These past days with no response has been hell. My anxiety is off the roof. Ive lost my appetite and barely ate anything. My boss has an aggressive attitude, not that he would yell or anything, but just the way he speaks. The few times I've spoken to him on the phone were mainly when I called in sick and he tried to pressure me to just take some medicine and come to work. Alot of coworkers have complained about him, so it's just not me, even once going to a coworkers apartment to get him to work. 

Need a bit advice or support. I will call tomorrow but I'm just so nervous. I hate confrontation, so I'm not sure if I have it in me to stand up for myself."	musakoy	post	27.444141800561535	female	White	0.9994227886199951	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety

Hi everyone. I am a 20-year-old male. Recently. I have been feeling down without any upsetting event in my life. I am currently in uni and today is my birthday. Since finishing high school and starting uni, my life has been same, repetitive and boring. All I do is go to uni, study, do my assignments, work and go to gym. I haven't made any new friends and I frankly beleive I lost the ability to make new friends. I miss my old friends from high school as we have drifted apart. All of them have a full time job and they have made new friends. Its not like we hate each other. If I made a plan to hangout, they will join and we would have a blast. But the problem is that its always me who is making a plan and organising it. They dont make plans and I see them on social media with new friends having fun. Also its not like I am a quiet person, I have talked to a lot of people in uni but out of class we don't talk to each other. I see people in uni grounds with their friends and it is so strange to me as why cant i make friends. And why people dont come talk to me like i talk to them. Also my second issue is I cant seem to get a girlfriend. I have never dated anyone. And as Im getting older I am starting to panick whether I will die alone. People say just talk to her and I have. I just dont how to attract them while talking as they seem to just talk I guess. Id say I am an average looking male and I have seen people who are uglier than me have gf. Does anyone have any solution to this. Much appreciated to reading this.  	jokingmassage	post	24.881321443972478	male	White	0.9956111311912537	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety

"I'm (31m) now able to look back and realize I was struggling bad with anxiety for a long time. A lot of social anxiety, but some general and other performance anxieties as well. In the beginning I knew I was anxious but I didn't know how to help myself and I think I overcompensated with fake confidence or a persona I would put on to protect myself, but just turned people off and made them think I was arrogant. 

I could put on a front just well enough where people wouldn't pick up the anxiety, but I think I came off as weird and self absorbed. I would clam up around people and that was the only way I could think to act to prevent them from knowing. I lost some friends over time and could also just pick up on people's negative reactions to me but I had no idea how to help myself. Would sometimes just protect my ego by acting out of character honestly. Or I would just be completely awkward and aloof.

After some sessiones I realized I couldnt be helped by therapy, which makes me incredible sad and even more suicidal.

My therapist would tell me that I was important and all that stuff but I dont feel anything when people say good stuff to me. In fact, I just think they say that stuff to make me feel better, and not because they genuinely mean it.

My problem is that I can´t trust people and Im ashamed to talk about what bothers me. I know it may sound stupid because therapist cant read minds but thats how I am.

My therapist told me that I needed medication but I told him that I would probably use it to hurt myself, which he understood. Now I regret It because I feel like I need medication.

Maybe my therapist wasnt that good or Idk but I dont think I can fix things by just talking about them.

Yes, I know I'am young and I still have a lot to learn and live but Its hard when even the most basic stuff is imposible for me.

I never had real friends, I never had a GF , I struggle to go outside and do stuff, I am incredibly akward and just clumsy in general. Even when I talk to people I notice they get nervous too, as if I transferred my anxiety to them too.

I can have good weeks where I dont feel like shit, but for some reason I always have just 1 day, 1 moment where I sabotage myself and think that I'am useless, weak, dumb, I wont suceed in anything, I wont have a GF, and that I dont deserve to live.

I know I have a lot of time but at the same time I feel like its too late to fix basic and stupid stuff that I should have learned a long time ago.

Right now, Im just exercising to keep my mind occupied and I will try to be my own therapist and see if that helps a little."	Loud-Lengthiness-717	post	20.16438762096491	male	Hispanic	0.9979713559150696	na	na	na	28	socialanxiety

"I've heard many times that therapy can be a process of finding the right therapist that clicks with you. I haven't tried therapy yet, but I think I will soon.

And you're young. I'm 24. I was on top of the world at 20, and now I'm extremely depressed. Our lives can shift dramatically even in short periods of time, and every decision we make can effect us greatly. Every day brings the opportunity for something new and vastly different. Just think of how much could possibly change in 4 years? I know a lot changed for me, not everything for the better, but I keep the knowledge that in another year, maybe even another month, my life could change again, and ill reclaim my happiness. It doesn't even have to be optimism, it doesn't have to be hope, just acknowledge that nothing ever remains the same forever. As long as we get up in the morning, things are BOUND to change. 

If you believe you are beyond help, then you've colored your reality with that mindset, and it becomes true. These negative affirmations become a reality you make for yourself.

I don't know you, but I know we are in somewhat similar boats right now. And I would ask you to realize that you are not beyond help. You haven't realized anything except for the fact that the path to being better might not be as clear as you once thought.

You and I have a duty to change our mindset, and prove to ourselves that our lives can take whole 180s and be greater than we thought. Because we WANT to be happy, it's why we're writing. Being dead, just straight up not existing...sounds so incredibly boring. We have the pleasure of experiencing reality, we ought to use that time to suit our interest, don't you think?

I felt the same about a bit of what your going through pal. Transferring anxiety especially. Your obviously a clever person and extremely self aware. Please try another therapist and then another. My first one put me off for years 6 years in fact. Then my third one was fantastic I really wish I didn't wait so long to try again. Spoke in terms that I could relate to and stopped me from being so internally focused. Your doctor can manage your medication so you cannot harm yourself but have a supply to look after yourself. Medication and therapy in tandem can be fantastic. Your 20 years old and even though you feel like everything's shit you could have a moment that changes everything. Do not give up on yourself. Keep asking for help because there's so many people that you do not realise are begging for you to do so.

"You've basically described me better without even knowing me. Every word resonates with me. 
I also tried to solve it myself since I usually have a lot of difficulties sharing my feelings with other people. Imagine how it felt telling everything to doctors.
As to the fact that people may feel your anxiety, it has some truth to it. People have mirror neurons that allow us to better read other people which was basically useful for surviving the dangers of the ancient world. It is still useful nowadays since it allows us better understand other people and learn stuff by imitation. The first time I got this idea (The Law of State Transference) from RSD Tyler who himself went through a transformative journey to being the life of the party.
The funny part is that if you're very anxious and unsure of yourself, this mechanism may be overly sensitive to reactions of other people. In other words, people pick up on subtle cues that you feel awkward and mirror back your awkwardness. You sense it and become even more anxious which may force people to avoid you in order to stop feeling this awkwardness. Well, at least, this is how it seems to me. And it also seems to create some guilt that you make other people anxious. 
Getting rid of this guilt and (partially) false beliefs is something that CBT tries to do. You will find evidence of positive reactions (for example, having a good time with other people) even when you felt like you made everyone sad and anxious. It is assumed that getting rid of false beliefs and guilt (cognitive component) removes the awkwardness that follows (behavioral component). And it works in some cases.
But in my opinion, some cases require the combination of medication and CBT. Imagine that you've been living this way for a really long time, so your behavior becomes so automatic that you don't even have enough time to think but automatically react in a certain way. Then, medication has the potential to ease the automatic reactions that you have, so that you have much easier time to work on your thinking patterns.
But it's always better to consult your medical provider and decide together what kind of treatment will work better in your case. Wish you all the best."	Loud-Lengthiness-717	reply	na	na	na	0.9979713559150696	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
I went through a few therapists before I found one that clicked, and at 30 years old I finally changed some things that were hurting me since I was about 13. It’s a work in progress and I’ll have to keep working at it. It took a while to find the right medication too, and I still have my bad days and weeks. Medication really can be worth it. You’re aware of the struggles you have and you’re seeking help, which is over and above what a lot of people do. Try to stick with it, best of luck.

"Not all therapy consists of motivational interviewing. Finding a therapist that uses cognitive behavorial therapy might be a better bet. It is a much more practical and goal oriented approach. CBT is shown to be the most effective treatment for social anxiety. My understanding is talk therapy doesn't have nearly the same success rate.

I have experienced the same thought patterns and others here have as well. What you must understand is that therapy is a process through which you get better and not just a solution. Things don't get better even after months of trying anxiety remedies. They usually get better after about a year or so when you start to build your confidence over what you can control in your life. What you really need right now is social support. Your therapist can provide that. Another thing you should start doing is stop looking to others for what you want out of your life. You have to provide that for yourself. Now, you may think, what  does that have to do with social anxiety? Well, it has everything to do with it. See, social anxiety stems from this idea that people will judge us in some way. But why? Why feel this way at all? It's because of your expectations of their expectations of you. You let the possibility of their judgement deter you from making your own decisions in life. This isn't bad in and of itself, as it signifies that you care not to hurt others but the problem occurs when it makes your life harder to live and all it does is lead to self sabotage. You look to others to provide you with a source of joy and well being, but that has to come from you not from them. People will always judge us for something, and we can't control that from happening. Until you address that, you won't be happy. You said you exercise. That's good. But do you enjoy that? If so, good. If not, you can learn to like that with being consistent. Whether it's once a day or once a week, it doesn't matter. As long as you are consistent. I understand not wanting to use medication as it didn't work for me and made me feel worse while I was on it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't for everyone. I say you should listen to your therapist about that because medication can help you remember what it felt like to be your natural self. They can start the dosage really small, so that you won't notice effects right away. Still, don't feel like you have to take meds to get better. Do whatever you think will be best for your mental and emotional recovery. I hope that helps!	Loud-Lengthiness-717	reply	na	na	na	0.9979713559150696	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
I am 21 years old and I have similar problems in my life. I have no friends, had no gf and it is hard for me to talk to people. Also, I moved to another country and I don't know the language at the moment. So my social anxiety just multiplied several times. I just have no idea how to talk to people. My brain just turns to jelly in these situations. I found a therapist online and had my first session a few days ago. We talked in detail about one of my recent problems in the store caused by my social anxiety. It was too hard for me to ask a clerk for help to find my way out of the store, so I almost resigned myself to spending the rest of my life in the supermarket. Before the session, I thought of this incident as something terribly shameful, but now that I was talking about it out loud discussing my feelings, I began to think about it more easily. This is probably how healing works. I believe that in a couple of months I will feel more confident about myself. The only thing I know for sure, don't try to fix your sick mind with a sick mind. You better experiment with therapists and find the one that suits you best. You can find a lot of them online for a small price. Discipline and self-control are the cornerstones of true strength (as Kratos said). Think positively and you'll be fine.

" I'm 30 now but I can distinctly remember the feeling you're describing at 20 of feeling like it's too late. It's not at all! Your 20's are all about growth, and challenging the things you don't like about yourself.   
  Everyone has their different pathway to coming out the other side, which can only be found through time and experimentation. For some the right therapist is a godsend, for some the right medication or maybe a mix of both. Some people find travel, a new hobby, a new life philosophy or they finally find a community that they belong to, which allows them to flourish.  
  I can guarantee people aren't saying things even half as mean about you, as you're saying to yourself, and even if they are, it usually comes from a place of their own insecurities and inadequacies.

For reference, [this](https://ibb.co/Bjvfw2s) was me at 15, and [this](https://ibb.co/dcns1sD) was me at 22. 

The key to defeating anxiety was the following:

1. Delving into the past and leaving “no stone unturned” when it came to trauma

2. Hitting the gym and building testosterone levels up 

3. Clearing inflammatory foods from diet (brain fog caused me extreme anxiety)

"I don't necessarily advise doing this since I think it's considered to be like an avoidant behavior, but it makes me feel a little better.

I have 2 online classes this semester and both of the proffesors are requesting video introductions to be posted and video presentations for later in the semester. To make myself feel better, I record the video, then run it through a video quality reducer/compressor (you can Google this, you can use a web one or an app one). This makes the video look grainy and can blur your face a little. It's adjustable, I usually go mid-range, so that way my features are fuzzy, but it's not overly noticable. It makes it look like I have a crap camera and/or Internet connection. Bonus, it makes upload time way faster and saves storage on your computer.

Besides that, seeing if you can have the lights dimmed or off while you present helps me (say you can't see the PowerPoint if you have one). I also just ordered some ""migraine lenses"", a special glasses tint that helps with migraines and overstimulation caused by light. They are pink, so that might be a source of anxiety. And they can be prescribed to you so if any teacher gets mad you can be like ""they're prescription"".

But sometimes, if the format allows, I'll say hey, there's 4 of us, let's read 2 slides and then move on to the next person to avoid one of us having to read a lengthy section. Usually people are on board.

I took a stress theory class once and one of the recommendations was to see if you can have your environment altered to help you mitigate anxiety. For me, that's asking for the lights to be dimmer while presenting so ""I can see my PowerPoint"" or wearing tinted glasses. There might be other things you can come up with under this category that can help you. 

I feel like I sound upbeat, but trust me, I know how hard this can be. It's horrible. But sometimes doing something a little anxiety inducing, like wearing pink lenses, can actually reduce anxiety from a something else more significant."	mmcckk_	follow-up	na	na	na	0.002539209555834532	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"I've heard a lot of good things about propranolol. I believe it just stops the production of adrenaline and other stress hormones, so it will really knock down the physical symptoms. I was already on another beta blocker for an unrelated condition, so I couldn't take an additional one so I ended up getting RXed Klonopin. Which obviously pretty much kills a lot of anxiety, but not completely. I will say tho, it won't magically give you social powers and skills. You're still you, just not as anxious. Which can help for building those social skills.

"This post contains a lot of personal vent. Sorry :(

Never had a GF even tho there were a lot girls that are interested in me in previous college years (still there are). Social anxiety holds me back. 

Now I have a crush on a girl and she has a crush on me as well. She does everything she can to talk/interact with me since the beginning of college but I avoid all due to my anxiety. I feel so sorry for her because she's been interested in me since the first year of college. She's wasted her college years by having a crush on somebody with 0 self-confidence like me.

She is like super beautiful. 10/10. I don't even know why she is interested in me in the first place.

There were a few other girls confessed me but I refused them as well :(

I'm so scared of being in a relationship/dating someone. I have low self esteem. Even tho I love how I look, that doesn't give me enough confidence boost. 

I also don't post my pics on social media because of low self esteem / social anxiety. 

Dating someone, being in a relationship seems impossible to me. 

BTW I avoided hanging out with my friends 99% of the time thanks to my anxiety :( 

I feel like I'm missing tons of things that I'll regret a lot in the future but there is nothing I can do.

Now this year is my last year in college and I think this won't be any different than previous years. Maybe will be even worse because my anxiety is higher than it ever was.

That way, you don’t need to feel guilty anymore. Also, it’s not your fault she’s liked you for so long, don’t feel bad about that.

so we all know the dreaded part of college applications for people with social anxiety, extracurriculars.. I need hope that college for me is possible. If anyone has gotten into a college how did you do it? what were your extracurriculars? what did you write about in your essay? That last question is quite important to me because I can’t think of a single thing to write for my future essay because I felt like I haven’t had any exciting experiences in my life, due to rotting in bed all day and having no social life. Plus I have nothing to trauma dump about so I really have nothing important to write about.	wurtheringheight	post	7.0839558484625655	male	White	0.9986385703086853	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety
"I was accepted to a few T20 universities, and I would say I participated and found leadership positions in environments I was comfortable in or saw future potential of being comfortable in. I know my social anxiety is especially worse around men, so I joined a female-led and predominantly female-membered program and after a couple of years, was promoted as a leader. It was definitely out of my comfort zone, but as the years went on I became slightly more comfortable in it, and constantly reminded myself that this is more like a job and I do not need to prove myself or be friends with anyone. 

I also was fortunately introduced to computer science pretty early on in middle school, so in high school, I participated and won a few virtual hackathons. Since I didn’t have to be there in person, I was more comfortable communicating to group members using discord chat, or awkward zoom calls lol (I just constantly reminded myself zoom is just inherently awkward, it’s not me).

I’ll be honest, I did kinda sorta trauma dump in my college essay, as I actually wrote about my impostor syndrome growing up underrepresented in STEM and finding community and growing in confidence, but I would say that not every essay has to be like that😭 it’s just what worked for me. I’ve heard people write essays comparing themselves to a random inanimate object and adding personal anecdotes. Just make sure that you turn a negative situation (if any) into a positive, and show your ability of growth and how you can contribute to the school’s environment. Have a weird quirk? Incorporate it. Interesting parents? Delve into that and how their nonconventional way of life affects you. Honestly just take some time word vomiting/brainstorming random things about you.

What I will say is that I am certainly miserable in the school I go to due to my social anxiety (was not my first choice, have yet to find one person who
matches my vibe), so just make sure the colleges you apply to are really good fits for your career goals so that you can really submerge yourself into your field and if the social doesn’t fall into place, at least you are enjoying yourself academically.

"""Alright class, we're gonna do a little ice breaker activity""

Heart drops.

""You'll say two truths and one lie about yourself, and everyone else will try to guess which one is the lie""

Mind goes blank. I'm in full fight or flight mode. I come up with a couple generic things, like ""I like fishing"", ""I like reading"", but I'm too scared to say anything more detailed than that.

And of-fucking-course, as everyone does their turn (completely effortlessly, smiling and nonchalant about it), all of the stuff I come up with gets used up by others. Looks like my turn will be last. I can't say the same thing as someone else, or else I'd look stupid.

It's getting closer and closer to my turn. I frantically try to think of something to say, but my mind is just blank. I wish the ground below me would just swallow me up and put me out of this misery. I hope to any higher power that may be listening that a meteor would just hit the classroom or something before my turn.

After agonizing minutes, it's now my turn. My heart is beating at a million miles an hour, my face is red. ""Um..... I... I like... studying? I... h... hate pizza?? Um...... Uhhh..........""

I glance around me. Everyone's head is turned, staring at me. The silence is broken by some giggles in the background.

I feel like dying. I want to drop the class right then and there.

"You love studying and hate pizza? What in Tarantinon is going on here? heh heh jk

Yah, triggering anxiety sucks. I've been sitting here trying to understand what irrational beliefs underly my fears.

I see that the biggest pain is self rejection. It feels like death which I guess makes sense. No wonder why I feel like I lose my sanity when I get insecure.

Of course part of that is, like you say, gets your brain into irrational fight,flight, freeze mode.

I realize in this moment that the only sane thing to do is to accept yourself no matter what. Like...self acceptance must be more important to me logically and emotionally than self rejection.

Self rejection is basically game over. There really isn't a logical path forward other than self acceptance. Sure I guess we can still see we can improve here or there, but we cannot allow it to result in emotional suicide which I now know is self rejection. Self rejection is essentially I believe now to be emotional suicide. But out of ignorance. I never did it on purpose. I never wanted to hate myself. I guess I felt like it was something I was supposed to do however if I failed or sucked or something. 

Now I see clearly that the only path up and onward is unconditional self acceptance. It's really more important than most things because without we shut down and it's game over until we accept ourselves a little more.

That's really the whole social fear game. It comes down to people not giving their determined all to a life of self acceptance. And I mean self, not our actions. We can do wrong actions and have guilt and make a change as we still accept ourselves. It only turns into deep shame when we reject ourselves. 


This is so key. So pivotal to the future. Unconditional Self Acceptance is my new top goal for my life. The more I value self acceptance, the more I will not give it up for something that is painful and an unnecessary part of life.

"I completely understand how you feel. Ice breaker activities can be really nerve-wracking, and it's perfectly okay to have those moments of anxiety. Just remember, you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people share similar feelings about these activities.

It's important to recognize that everyone has their own comfort zones and ways of expressing themselves. It's not a reflection of your worth or intelligence. If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, take a deep breath and remind yourself that it's okay to be yourself, even if your responses are different or more detailed than others.

"Actually it IS great classroom activity. I wish we had somethig like that in a school. I had this only at my therapy group at it helped with my SA a lot! It was hell at first, but it was better every time. Here is what helped at start: dont overthink it: it doesent matter what you say. Everyone will be too occuied with guessing what is truth and what is false. Not what it actually is. And the second, but most helpful thing was: try to go first. That way you wont say anything others already said and most importantly you will not be so anxious. You will not feed your anxiety waiting while everyone tell their stuff. You will be first (try to be first) so there will be less time to make your anxiety bigger and bigger.you will get used to say something first over time. But important thing is do it EVERY TIME. Not just once. Everytime you will speak the last you are feeding your avoidant behaviour.


There is lot of things you can say (and it actually doesent matter if you Like them or not) 
Fishing
Penguins

Your aunt
Carrots

"I had the ""give one fact about yourself"" icebreaker on the first day of a psych class so the professor could remember all of our names.

Two truths and a lie (especially one that's supposed to also sound like a truth to trick people) would be super hard to come up with in just a few minutes, so I don't blame you at all.

I hate when you go to school on the first day and you have to do this social icebreaker shit. It’s so fucking annoying and it makes school very uncomfortable and unenjoyable. Nobody thinks of people with social anxiety and there’s always a stigma against them. If you sit alone, or don’t talk, society calls you “emo” or “weird”. It’s not like we can just instantly make ourselves social and extroverted overnight. That’s just not how having social anxiety works.

You're not the only one with social anxiety in the room. Do you know how prevalent it is these days?

Yes, we did that too. But in my experience it was much more difficult for me, than talking about given topic. But effective too.

Idk, I have BPD and anxiety and it makes it hard for me in relationships. I haven’t dated anyone in 6 years, I got sober and I had a lot of mental health issues to deal with before I got to the point where I felt I could date again. I started talking to/dating this guy 10 days ago. 10 😩 We talk through out the day every day, have feelings for each other, we hang out a lot….And I accidentally called him my boyfriend today in the car. So then I texted him and said that I “kinda called you my boyfriend in the car and I realized we haven’t really talked about that yet, and I don’t want to pressure you or make this feel rushed. When you’re ready to talk about that let me know” and like what the fuck is wrong with me bro???? Oh my god. It’s most likely way too soon for that and I am now stuck laying in bed thinking about how I probably messed this really good thing up by asking him this after 10 days. Idk why I’m telling y’all this but I’m mortified. Being vulnerable is an issue for me and my fear of rejection is very intense. Then I said “sorry if I made it weird I kind of word vomited” and he said “haha no worries beautiful I’ll talk to you in the morning.” Guys. I’m 32 next month and I feel like an idiot.

The first two days I was almost bed ridden, I had the worst joint/muscle pains and a cranking headache. Probably one of the worst ones I’ve ever had, it was horrid but today I’ve noticed that I actually feel a lot more alive. I feel a fuck ton more interested in people and life in general and i wasn’t exhausted within the first few hours of the day, weirdly enough my libido has also increased and so has my confidence. I just thought I’d jot this down here and see if any of y’all had similar experiences?	throwaway698371	post	13.206672011761366	male	White	0.0013566084671765566	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety

"I'm 22 year old male and for the past few years I have been suffering from quite severe social anxiety.

My story starts from always having hated giving presentations at school. However, slowly during pandemic my fear of being the centre of attention while giving a presentation started to spread to my daily life. 
When my anxiety was peaking, I once had to just run away from classroom when it was my turn to speak. I physically wouldn't have been able to say a word. Also simple tasks as going to grocery store or claiming a package were like missions that I had to plan for. I would do everything online if it was possible. Even when I was seeing my close friends, I would randomly just freeze up and make everyone very uncomfortable.

So yes, it was bad. I tried every supplement I could find. Betablockers, L-theanine, passionflower, even microdosed shrooms. All these were helpful but only as long as I believed in them.

Last week something clicked. There was a work-related situation and my anxiety was starting to build up. This time instead of running away from it, I decided to lean into it. I accepted the situation and even embraced it. Suddenly instead of feeling flighty, I felt like I was very centered in my being and able to face whatever would happen. The more the anxiety would start to creep back, the more I would enjoy and embrace it.

I realized that all this time I have been fighting against myself. Instead of accepting the part of myself that was feeling anxious, I was fighting and suppressing it and thus creating this huge division inside myself.

What I am now suggesting to everyone is that instead of trying to suppress your anxiety, learn to accept it and embrace it. Instead of focusing into that other person to find acceptance, lean into your anxiety and give yourself the acceptance you are looking for. I'm not saying that I'm completely cured now, but this has been a huge improvement. When I manage to stay centered this way, it almost feels like I have cheats on and I can do whatever I want.

This is my first post ever and english isn't my native language so forgive my grammar errors. Hopefully someone finds this helpful. Social anxiety is something I wouldn't wish for my worst enemy."

My therapists have told me this time and time again I could never fathom or comprehend what they meant when they say “lean into it”, lean into the feeling of anxiety. I’m asking literally what do you mean when you say that. How do you do that. What do you think in your head?

"I recommend finding a situation where you experience small to moderate levels of anxiety. Then working with this technique there.

What I used to do before, was that whenever I would start to feel anxious about a situation, I would mentally try to ""ecape"" and suppress the anxiety and that is where my body would go into fight flight freeze- mode. So my natural coping reaction was actually making things worse. I would be anxious of being anxious.

I would describe leaning into it as actually wanting that anxiety, welcoming it. Owning all the difficult feelings that come with the situation. Not trying to hide or fake anything. Tell yourself: ""I actually like this feeling"", ""give me more"", ""I'm totally ok with everything that comes up""  Basically you learn to be comfortable with discomfort and slowly you notice that the discomfort is gone.

Staying centered is also important part. Dont let your focus get off from what you are feeling. This is where we usually try to escape from our anxiety making it worse and we begin to seek the other persons approval. Everyone is giving the advice to not focus on yourself but instead to focus on to the other person, but in my opinion you have to first be centered into your being, owning yourself 100% and only from there you are able to focus on to that other person without losing yourself."

" As I said above, you have to start practicing in easier situations where the anxiety is not that bad. I agree that in the middle of full panic attack where your body is going crazy, this is almost impossible to do. If you get anxiety alone while stressing about a situation, start there.

Be cautious of not setting limiting beliefs for yourself. Like: ""This is not possible for me"", ""I can never get better because I have it worst""

Trust me, for me it was so bad that I was afraid to show up to my friends, I planned every word I was about to say. If I can get better, you can too, we all can recover from this."	NearbyWoodpecker7045	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0014187035849317908	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"I think I have experienced something similar. There was once a situation where I was really anxious and the other person said something that made me really pissed off afterwards. I was really surprised because that anger made me actually feel whole and confident and I haven't felt like that for a long time.

Afterwards, I think that my confidence at the moment of anger was not just because of my anger, it was because I owned that feeling. I felt like my anger was justified. Instead of pushing that angry part of me away, I welcomed it and that gave me so much power and control over myself.

Now what we have to do is to bring that feeling of being justified to feel what we feel to any situation. Whether we feel angry, sad, anxious, whatever. We don't want to fight against ourselves, we want to go with the flow, welcome and embrace all the different sides of us. Thats how we can learn be confident in any situation."

"Yes, people have had all kinds of reactions to my nervous behaviour. Some asked am I ok, some just seemed really confused as I was able to hide my anxiety but they still could feel it. My face muscles have spasmed from too much fake smiling and sometimes I just felt as if I was going to start crying in the middle of a sentence. Also experienced situations where I was really close to not be able to physically continue talking but somehow I fought my way through those.

It has been only week since I discovered this leaning into the anxiety so I cant tell how it will go in the future. Also I have made some progress through exposure before I found this technique.

This affected my symptoms in a way that I feel I can now tune in myself way better than before, and I feel like I really don't care that much anymore what people think of me. Instead of escaping from myself I can now find comfort in me and it feels like no one can take this ability away from me. My voice went from shaky to normal.

Yes, being centered and accepting any feeling that arises has to be made a new default state of being. It requires some conscious effort through practice because we are so used to spiral into anxiety from the smallest trigger. Once you find the switch in your head, it will get much easier to maintain this state. Key is to accept and embrace, not fight and suppress.

I drift the line of ""im comfortable going into this petrol station"" and "" and then the bus... uh i uh urrr uh umm what was i saying ummmm sorry no i forgot."" An social anxiety to the point im shaking, stuttering and completely unfocused just checking out of the grocery store and being able to stay in hostels travelling and easily talk to anyone happily. Its a long way from where i used to be when i couldnt even talk to family i lived with. 

Now, im trying to date as a young queer. And theres a very pretty girl who appears out of my league. And i have recently reached a point where im reaching out to people after some successes in my life that have given me confidence. So im gonna ask her on a date. If shes up for it im thinking either something simple like coffee orrrrr possibly making these yummy customisable homemade pizzas my sister used to do with me and these fruit pies where you can make your own designs and its fun, i did it with these two sisters travelling. I dont know if thats a good idea, but i feel like id have fun. My place is really nice and clean. But anyway, i saw our mutual friend the other day who is also very nice, and while i thought i was cool and calm beforehand, the moment she entered my car my brain went to its usual wiring. Freeze. No thoughts, just stiff body language and awkwardly trying to say the things i thought of earlier and failing. I come off like a loser. Like someone incapable of conversation. Im not too embarrassed, its always like that with her so im used to it. But honestly, im really fucking cool and sweet. I deserve to have a girlfriend after all this time and effort and how much ive built myself over my life. Im tired of believing i deserve to be lonely because of my social anxiety.

I have no confidence about myselfy and poor selfesteem  . So my everyday life goes like i go for work come back sit in my room watch some series /youtube /insta /do my hobbies and ends up wasting a lot of time , i avoid social interactions ( f >> m) as much as possible i dont even want to go for having food in a public place/mess/restaurant so i end up ordering food .I do have my college friends but i am not close to any and even if i talk idc inside  i am blank . Mostly i am a stoic and emotionless as a person but sometimes occasionaly i do get down (it comes randomly)m during this phase i dont even enjoy my hobbies anymore and just lie on my bed ) . Gradually i have become so emotionally detached i dont feel like i care anymore , but sometimes i do get fomo and i know my future will be full of regret , and sometimes i do get the idea of changing myself but it fades away easily .This emotionless is getting stronger day by day

"Well, first of all, you should embrace the circumstances you have now. Giving up doesn't make sense anywhere, anytime.
How old are you? What's your job? Do you have any perspective in life? What do you wanna buy yourself in the future? What hobbies do you have? Does your hobby require you to reach financial success in life?

What are your priorities? Do you wanna talk and hang out with people, or do you wanna be more serious, precise, targeted for personal success?
Happiness doesn't require lots of people around you. The most important thing is your vision. Vision of the world, the life, the you. 

So, first of all, calm your mind. Regret or not regret - doesn't make a single sense. This is the situation you're in, so embrace it, buddy.

It's good to have acquaintances in life. Good to have close friends. But if you are not comfortable speaking to people now - don't do it, unless it's necessary stuff like job. 

Why would you regret it? How does it affect your life? Besides all the fears you created in your mind, think of it objectively.

If you're doubting yourself - you're not stoic. You love stoic philosophy? Go explore it more - and change your mind accordingly!

Embrace all the things you love. Get motivation and enthusiasm out of them. Don't sit and think about how anxious you are. It's not gonna help, and more so, it's gonna kill you.

I have lots of friends, actually. But that doesn't change my mind about all the stupid useless shit they do. I've tried hanging out - doesn't like that at all. Not because I'm anxious, because I'm not interested in the stuff they do. I'm interested in building myself as a human.
Yes, I'm still stupidly anxious in some interactions - but what does it matter? I have a colleague who also doesn't like spending time with people, but he fucking delivers at job. He found his own reality and it's good for him (I guess).

Besides financial success there are hobbies and... you! Human! You can explore philosophy, esoterics, any other sphere you can probably deep dive into.

You have a hobbie? Great! Embrace it. Explore it, do it, gain enthusiasm for it, et cetera. There's so much you can do.

Be grateful with what you have now. Don't look in the past, don't look in the future - look at NOW.

All this exposure stuff is bullshit (for me, at the very least). But building up your mind? Oh boy does it help. It's the first thing you need to do. You need to sort everything out in your mind - because it's a mess right now.

Completely closing yourself is not a good thing though. You should strike a balance between. Between respecting your desires and being somewhat interactive with people that are interested in your being.

There's so much to do in this world. Yes, it's horrible around, but that shouldn't affect you as a human.

You should find enthusiasm for yourself - for who you are and what you do.

Let go of the illusion of control. Instead - once again - embrace the situation.

After you start sort everything inside your mind you'll gain more and more knowledge about how socium works. There'll still be a lot of job to do - but it's good, right? It's amazing that you have an ability to endlessly improve yourself. Not just with this. All the hobbies, philosophy, hell, all the fucking knowledge you can get in this life.

Dark things come, dark things go. Instead of ruminating on how badly it affects you - you need to keep your chin up and with great respect for it inspect it.

"I'm at the same point in life, just a year elder to u. I've few friends at the workplace, I laugh, crack jokes, but only talking. No hangout nor any physical activities involved together, outside of workplace.

Close connections/close friends aren't needed. Acquaintances are sufficient.

It's really good u don't share ur personal details/life with anyone other than ur parents. People aren't there to help u.. people are there only to make judgements abt u and hurt u in the end.

I have no real hobbies too, except for some reading/writing/surfing random stuff/memes/quotes, on the internet. Everything involves only the mobile. I don't even watch series. Movies are rare too. Only insta reels/YouTube.

"I did spent sometime is this situation too.
Progress dont have to be immediate, force yourself to do 1 small goal, then keep it going, dont overload yourself, make achievable goals, set a reasonable time to complete the goal. Even though your sad, force yourself to do it, you might still be sad, but I didnt stop you from progress, you will be okay.
A friend are not good at everything, so dont be mad bc you're not that proximate to your college friends, also give them a chance, some might be great to hang out, others to talk, get advices, play a game, talk about a specific thing, etc.
When you get more confident, get more proactive in your friendships, ask people to hang out, I'm saying that bc when I lost contact with ppl I used to talk, I didnt get invited to go out anymore and I didnt figure out I could be the one who's doing it until had a talk about it in therapy. Try to engage with your family too, if possible.
Dont be hard on yourself, positive afirmatives might help, you are capable. We might subconsciously think that we're not. We were once more capable, so we can get there and even beyond, I am better then I ever was before, bc I force myself to do those things, to let me feel uncomfortable, until it become more natural for me. Some skills might be better than others, but no one is good at everything, so do you. Keep sucess measures in the present, slow down a little bit, calm down. I recommend you therapy and mindfullness meditation.
We tend to overthink about the future, we imagine thousands of things of the same scenario, but we forget that only one can happen at a time or most of the time, none of them, so we suffer for a thing that didnt even happened, thats bc you're not living the present itself, look around, notice things you might missed, like the wind in you hair, the temperature, the nature, etc. FOMO is a bitch, but you can get over it.
Also you can consider spending less time in social media, they're not accomplishing their goals as a commucation tool. All the ppl do there is post the best events of their lifes and then you get you comparing your live with other people. I used a trick were I acessed my social media in the browser and deleted the apps, so I would have less functions to work there, cause I used to share a lot of things in my instagram stories, therefore with this trick I couldnt post anything and spent less time there. 
If you dont something, research, ask about it, dont be ashamed, I also had to learn to talk to girls and used to had no girls as friends too.

"I'm sorry that you're feeling like this. I can relate to it. Am not sure whether you have spoke to a doctor about this but if not I think it may be good to do so. The things you mentioned are symptoms of some mental health issues - so may be worth checking this out.  

If you feel very low and emotionless it can be extremely hard to find motivation to do things but if it so happens there are days where you have energy to get out of the house I would recommend. I try to go to bars to watch music/sport by myself - I'm not saying this fixes the issues but I feel like doing this at least gives me a feeling like I'm getting out and becoming a bit more comfortable going out and doing these things alone. I feel like its gradually becoming a bit easier. Even if you were to go out and purchase food for take away that would be a really positive start. 

 Another thing which I find helps is getting exercise but I'm not sure if you would have the motivation to do this at the minute - if is possible to do any exercise that would be very positive - What you are feeling is incredibly hard to deal with - that's why I'm encouraging you to seek support. You're definitely not alone in feeling like this - I hope things get better for you my friend."	Roomieboyy	reply	na	na	na	0.997088611125946	strong	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"Exercise. The fact that you posted here shows motivation, that you're willing to ask for help. You know that this isn't a good path to go down. You're doing the right thing by asking. Next step is to exercise. You have no passion now, and it'll take time to get it back. Start avoiding meaningless things like instagram that don't allow for much joy. Identify what makes this worse & what helps. Exercise. What exercise do you feel most confident doing. Start with that. If you think you can start just try to go for a walk every day.

Also if you think you're up for the task then getting a pet can definitely help, but you've got to commit. My chocolate lab brought me out of a dark depressive moody stage that nobody else could manage. I got him as a puppy and raised him to hunt ducks with me. I didn't have to talk to him, just make sure he was taken care of and he gave me life and joy that I couldn't find in myself. Don't get me wrong, animals are a lot of work and dedication. I think that's part of what helps so much. In helping another thing, you stop focusing on yourself and start understanding that you have value to take care of another life.

All I got to say is that you've got this man, I can tell by how you're reaching out and grasping for a ladder to get out of this pit. Being a male today isn't easy, depression is real, but the indomitable human spirit is also real. When we dig deep, real fucking deep, it's there waiting, waiting to fight all the shit that happens.

"Let me ask you this. . Is your anxiety the sort of anxiety that stems from poor vocalization?. Meaning you  overthink how you say something, have a hard time pronouncing, and for many, can barely speak effectively at all? Or is it situational anxiety, where your moreso focused on what to say, perhaps your body language. Regardless I think I may have advice that can completely get rid of your anxiety and put you on the right track to be exactly who you wanna be. Actually, im certain it will work, as long as your anxiety isnt because of a brain defect. Having an anxiety disorder, regardless of wether it runs in the family or not doesnt matter, thats not a brain defect, you did it to yourself, (In the sense that you control how you think and react, regardless of what there is to percieve outside of said sphere. Even through incapablility, you are at the helm of your mind and how you experiance this life), even if you had no control over the situations you were in, you werent born with is what im trying to elude to. Maybe you were geared in such a way that you were more likely to develop anxiety, but this is not the same as having an irreversible condition. You can still get rid of it. In my case I had severe depression and was borderline skitzofrantic, to the extent to where I convinced myself I was possesed. However through logical discernment, and willpower, I was able to pull myself out of it for my families sake. So let me get back to the point. Not trying to be convoluted, but im trying to be as detailed as possible for you. So let me know if youd be willing to trust me to help you, and if your willing to give yourself a real chance to be who you want to be. Ive talked to many people before and ive changed their lives, I do it for free. I wouldve became a therapist but I do things a bit differently. Im nice but im also blunt. Therapists who talk purely about feelings, who are just there to drag out your time to fill their pockets, not something im fond of. Im sure they arent bad people and are doing what all therapists are trained to do, but the runaround bs is not something someone seeking a real solution would want. To be effectively therapudic, you also have to be, like a docter. You have to diagnose, make relations to other conditions, you have to know how memory wiring works, the subconcious, thought patterns. Essentially, you have to have logic. Even docters dont use logic. Hey, let me give you this anxiety medication instead of rooting out the issue, essentially screwing you over, not solving whats actually wrong with you, so that when you stop taking your anxiety meds, not only are you gonna still have anxiety, but it will likely be worse than before being on the medication. Oh and hey, let me set you up with one of, if not, the most perscribed anxiety med, xanax, which is more addictive than cocaine, to the point to where quiting cold turkey, would most likely kill you with the most agonizing withdraw symptoms that last for over a year, leaving a permanent mark on your brians functionality. Oh did I mention that xanax bores microscopic holes in your brain? So yea, logic is something very few individuals make the choice to take part in when given the opportunity to do so(or they just dont care, alot of docters dont lol) Nothing wrong with that, but in this case, you need someone logical and caring whos willing to do everything within their power to get you back on your feet. Its also a plus that ive been in your shoes, so I can relay my own experiances on top of what I can deduce seperately. Please contact me, let me know the depth and severity of your struggle so I can try to help. The only thing stopping you, is your own fear, or lack of confidence in my words. Right now in this very moment, ask yourself from your higher selfs perspective, ""How bad do you really want this, to be free from anxiety? Are you willing to put the work in?"". If yes, this work would include keeping an eye out for oppertunites, a willingness to subject yourself to trial and error, taking chances you might not otherwise take. With that being said, when saying something along the lines of (why cant I just be normal, brain, just work for once). You cant blame the current state of disrepair your mind is subject to for your problems, if when given the oppertunity, the choice to get better, you instead choose to ignore such an oppertunity. At that point, your doing it to yourself knowingly and willingly, your not a victim. So once more please message me, I want for you, what you intended for yourself from the start. If you take part in spirituality, take this as a sign from the universe, god, or whatever you believe, that your plea's have been heard, and that your pain will soon be addressed."

"Comparing yourself with anybody else is always bad stuff. Don't do it. Another thing that'll kill you. 
Imagining and constantly being inside your own mind is also a bad thing. Try to look at things objectively, and more importantly - look objectively at yourself. When you are constantly comparing yourself with others it creates an unimaginable source of negative in your mind. So, don't do it. Look at yourself. You is the only thing that matters. Fuck others. Their position, their opinion - it doesn't matter. You need to develop by yourself as a person. Don't look at others. BUT(!) don't be an egoist. It's entirely different things. Well, that's what an objectivity is. If you are OBJECTIVELY wrong - you are wrong. Objectivity is hard to reach, but it's possible. Strive towards it. Then you'll realize how stupid it is comparing yourself in your circumstances to a completely different human in a completely different circumstances. Treat everything in your life with pure mind.

That's why I'm talking about how much mindwork means. It's the most important fucking thing in the world.

Forget all the fears you've got in your mind. Don't succumb to them. It's bad stuff.

That's understandable. It's easy to compare yourself to others. I used to work as hard as I could to keep up with my coworkers, but it turned out I was outperforming them the whole time. It was just in my head. In addition, you would probably do better if you liked it better. So, it's not a problem with you, it just may not be a right fit. But maybe you just need to stick it out.

I was bombing it, i was getting pretty buff and looked pretty nice actually.

At the beginning of 2023 I started working out again, this time I told myself ""I'm doing it for me. In the off chance, in the future, I run into another crush and I'll be prepared"" Well, after a few months I stopped again because, my social skills are extremely awful and I was devastated that I wasn't having any luck on the dating apps. I felt like I was doing it all for nothing. So i stopped.

Just last month i started going to the gym for a third time. I'm telling myself ""Just do it, have fun. Don't pressure yourself, that's just gonna make you unmotivated."" Well, so far so good. I have no expectations of meeting anyone in the future, my social skills are still not the best and I accept that. And some days it hits me really bad. But you know what?

Never stop going to the gym. It does build confidence. The bottom line to eradicate or make social anxiety less prevalent is to put yourself in uncomfortable situations on purpose it’s the only way without medicine to get better truthfully. I still have social anxiety by a good margin but it is less then it was 3-5 years ago by a good amount.  I chew gum a lot, for some reason it helps me in social situations. Without the gum im about 10x more anxious. Which is sad. I don’t take meds either. I want to Conquer this on my own, sometimes I want to give in and I may but at least I tried for so long to not take meds. I just want a girlfriend, and social anxiety doesn’t help in that regard. My social skills get hindered by it. It doesn’t matter that im good looking when I suck at talking. Funny party is, I have social anxiety yet I am charismatic. I think I am also a little narcissistic too. Anyways, keep working out for you and focus on self improvement then the woman or whatever you want will come your way. The girl that likes you will like you for you, not because you have exceptional conversational skills or whatever. I’ll be 25 next year and only had sex once.  Shit is bizarre.

my depression is more than because of being unable to socialise, as the social skills have been a forever problem. definatly a mix of: bad childhood, trauma, bullying all throughout school, low self esteem, being rejected and as an adult its gotten worse for sure where these problems are magnified eg unable to hold a job for long, feeling out of place non stop feeling like everyone is judging and talking about me.

Although attractiveness def does make a difference especially when getting a girl/boyfriend, I feel like perhaps your friends resulting increase in confidence may have been why he made so many more friends so quickly.

Does anyone know of any good content that just focuses on ~social~ anxiety? Every time I start a book, listen to a podcast, or watch a video on social anxiety it seems to focus more on panic attacks than anything. I’m not someone who really struggles with panic attacks, I’m just extremely awkward and nervous in social settings.

I have had anxiety issues because of stress, and it puts me under a lot of pressure to interact with people. I self doubt and get super concious about what to say, how to say and what will people think of me. I also tend to avoid going out and interacting with people because again it puts a lot of pressure of how to interact and get the social etiquettes right. I often find myself sweating, or gasping for breath or my voice cracking up. This doesn't allow me to make friends and i fear i will end up being alone in the end.

When I do tell her a symptom that I have and I tell her that I have had it for years, she will ask me why didn't I tell her about it.
 I don't know why I do this. I don't know if it is the Social anxiety or that I don't want to overwhelm her with information.
Or maybe it's the fact that I don't usually talk much anyway?
It could be the fact that I don't feel like I deserve medical help in the first place.

"I was prescribed one 10mg tablet 3 times a day. The leaflet warns against using it infrequently. Once you're on it you have to see your doctor when you want to stop taking it.

As for it's effects? Amazing. I've been on it for about 5-6 months now and I can barely cope without them. I was having all day panic attacks, every day. They stopped about a week after I started the medication, and I notice the difference if I miss just a single dose. It's more about quality of life than it is dependency, imo.

As for a tolerance? Not that I've noticed. I mean, my doc talked about upping the dose if they stopped working, but I assumed that was because they affect each individual differently.

"I don't think you being unattractive has much to do with the situation, in all honesty. It sounds more like the person doesn't really know how to socialize outside of joking and cutting up. That's their problem and not yours. They also may not know how to interact with you because they feel you've shut down the conversation. A simple ""Good morning (afternoon)"" can do wonders to open the conversation again, should you want to. 

It's certainly possible to toe the middle ground and not be ""charmed"" by someone while also being polite and respectful. I find this works well in most situations to keep conversations civil.

"Yep. I am starting to get acclimated to a new friends group after joining a hobby. There’s this guy who doesn’t dislike me I don’t think but is very confused why I’m not always matching his energy. other people in the group have been confused at times, but I felt safer opening up to them because they didn’t seem to assume it had to do with them. I think this guy might start understanding a bit more but if we’re going to be more than just acquaintances, I hope we can have a conversation about some of what I deal with, having PTSD on top of it probably doesn’t help much either . It took me decades years to understand how to present myself in front of people, so if I ever had an anxious day, they would understand. I have this thing where I can be the life of the party or scared as hell to say anything. Unfortunately as someone born in the mid 80s, the understanding of anxiety was non existent. It’s scary to think it wasn’t that long ago. Even in college early 2000s I don’t feel people got it.

*edit* he is not treating you this way because he thinks you’re ugly. I guarantee. Some thing that has helped me before is trying to start a little small talk and say something like “ Hey, I get really nervous starting at a new job so I appreciate you being understanding. I don’t mean to sound or seem rude. It’s just I get overwhelmed sometimes.” Anyone who’s worth their salt will be a little bit more understanding."

This is the exact reason we need to have social anxiety support groups monthly for all of us to come together and get better and practice being social together face to face and get comfortable then keep moving on step by step with each others support but this needs to be done face to face not online so we can get comfortable and practice as much as possible the solution is to have in every city and every town social anxiety support groups monthly or better yet twice monthly to help us move step by step with lot's of support from each other who knows how much this suffering of social anxiety can affect us all	MelancholyBean	reply	na	na	na	0.995628833770752	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"if you want to get rid of your social anxiety, the way is to develop a positive (or at least realistic) version of reality. What you wrote up there is a quite frankly poor analysis of social dynamics. This concept of ""one of us"" that you descrive (you and some axious people vs. the rest) simply doesn't exist. Don't let yourself grow in this erroneous conception of the world. What I'm trying to say that if that probably what you believe people think, and why they act the way they do, is probably incorrect. Reality is (surprisingly for you) much more positive than you think.

So what you can do is take an humble (almost scientific) posture, and try to understand people, and your place in these dynamics.

A healthy perspective (simplistic, but you can build on it) would be to recognise that you are very normal person, like the rest of people. You have your strengths/weaknesses, but you are essentially like everyone. Basically a nice person of the office, even thougb you are anxious often. What do people think of people that show signs of anxiety ? That are insecure ? They feel bad for them, they have empathy. People are nice, we don't like others to suffer. Etc, etc. More importantly, everyone like you has their own issues. Ask them for real, you'd be surprised how many people feel terrible under the appearances. Focus on others.

It's not with the kind of negative, difformed perspective and that you will grow. You can do better :)"	MelancholyBean	reply	na	na	na	0.995628833770752	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

Also I think it’s prob just like why would someone keep interacting with someone who doesn’t rlly interact back, unless they’re super kind and just have that personality.

"I wish it was only that. I kinda got bullied for not liking someone (aka living my life), because everybody ""loves"" them. So they created this rivalry out of nowhere. Seriously.

This person seem to fear being alone, so they push their friendship on anyone that gives attention, so they're never alone if they're apart from their friends. it's ok, I think it's harmless and it's good to be social. But they have bad traits (imo)... they talk behind people's back (make jokes about people's appearance, like fat jokes), make jokes about suicide, can't shut their mouth when Professors are talking or someone is answering a question, don't respect people's boundaries, only talk about themselves and not listen to their friends or care when they need empathy, etc. They're older than me and still are so immature in a way.

Other than that, they're an ok person to talk with if they're your friend, like a easygoing person, IF you ignore these bad traits. But I just don't have the energy to listen to them talking about themselves all the time while ignoring their bad habits, cause I have different values. It feels like Regina George from means girls, but we're in college.

So, they bullied me and and nobody did anything (not even my friends). After that none of them talk to me anymore.

I think it's fine, tho. I just wish not vibing with someone didn't cause so much drama. Not to mention the wasted time."	MelancholyBean	reply	na	na	na	0.995628833770752	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"No worries, your comment was well written. Telling people about my SA is a new thing I’ve tried recently, it mostly just makes me feel better because I’m not worried that I’m offending anyone by seeming aloof or, in the case of closer relationships, I’m not worried that the person thinks I will always be quiet/uncomfortable seeming. 


I would say it does make me more relaxed because it takes away a layer of feeling like I have to hide a secret and overcome something bigger just to “blend in”. Also, most recently I told my last employer about it because I joined a new team and there was a lot of public speaking involved, and telling them about SA took a lot of pressure off of me because i was really worried that I was going to make my bosses upset by not seeming engaged enough. Luckily, they were really supportive and understanding. A large part of the anxiety for me is feeling like I am hiding the fact that I’m anxious, so telling people and just owning it makes me feel like I accept myself a bit more and makes me feel lighter. Though I also notice sometimes I feel weird afterwards like I worry that I made myself look bad by being the person with crippling anxiety, so the SA in that case kinda shape shifts and doesn’t go away completely but I like that it alleviates it somewhat. 

When I told my boss, he reacted by basically saying “whatever negative impression you think you’re giving off, I didn’t receive. I assumed you were introverted and that it might just take longer to gain your trust or that you might just be a quieter person. But thank you for your transparency”. When I told someone who I was getting to know/dating, they also reassured me kind of in a similar way as my boss. 


So as far as I have experienced, people seem to receive it well. In regard to how they treat me afterwards… with my boss he basically treated me the same as before but he also tried to reasonably accommodate me like ask me if I was comfortable speaking in meetings beforehand. With personal relationships idk I didn’t really notice a big difference in the way people treated me cause I think they would have interacted with me regardless of if I explained why I was being the way I was. They were just good people. 

Actually, after typing this out and reflecting some more I’m realizing that it really seems like people don’t think about it at all really. Like they notice, yes… but it’s kinda like how you’d notice anything about anyone. Like Tom’s hair is orange, or whatever. Also, even if they did notice and judge us… we still couldn’t control that judgement. And the people who judge would judge for other things too. I think in some cases I was telling people cause I wanted to control their perception of me, like I didn’t want them to see my quietness and think that’s all there is to me, but obvi peoples thoughts of me are their thoughts and it’s out of my control and none of my business anyway. Thinking back, I don’t think telling people made much of a difference in their perception of me because they were the kind of people who weren’t going to judge me harshly based off being quiet anyway. It was more just for my own comfort to admit I was nervous and to feel like I could be honest/be myself in some way, even if it was only that way for the moment. 


Do you have experiences with talking about your SA? Have u ever told anyone or wanted to tell? Also I’m sorry this was so long!!"	MelancholyBean	reply	na	na	na	0.995628833770752	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"Please don't say sorry, it was not too long at all. It was very rewarding for me to read you, honestly. Because we both know what it feels to have SA issues, and having to deal somehow with the pressure in order to live and enjoy life.

When you say that saying it takes away a layer of feeling that you have to hide a secret, and that a large part of the anxiety is, precisely, that feeling of having to hide the anxiety... I feel it, is like lifting a weight off one's shoulders.

Since I was a child I just learn different ""ways"" to hide my anxiety to everyone, even my parents, because for them it was important that I was strong, and pretty. I did what I could. And use the fact that I was an attractive girl to calm down my anxiety, also because I grow up with the idea that I was only appreciated for that, and that everything else was wrong inside me, as a human being.

When I was like 15, I remember clearly thinking ""It does not matter who you are, only who they think you are, and if you look good you can actually do and say whatever you want, they are going to like me"", that helped me lots, at that moment of my life, to overcome the anxiety  in high school/college. That was my first ""strategy"", it was basically flirting. Also I drank a lot, you know, just to blend, and be more outgoing. But that's the past and it makes me sad to remember that.

So now, and answering your question (thank for ask me, by the way), I never told anyone that I have SA issues, I just told my partner's boss (because he kept inviting us to hang out) and one of his friends, that ""I am quiet, because I am shy not because I don't like them"" or similar stuff like ""well, you know we shy people this or that"" (This is my second strategy and the one I use nowadays).

I never actually had the courage to say the words ""social anxiety"". It scare me a little bit. What I notice about myself is that when I said that to my partner's boss I felt uncomfortable, it didn't help me at all. But with his friend, I feel more relaxed now around him. Not that I am completely myself, but at least I don't feel is torture to hang out with him sometimes. I don't know why it did not worked with the boss, because he is super nice.

I wrote just too much, I hope you don't regret you ask me lol. But I still want to tell you that I just loved what you told me about that people don't really think about it, ... they notice it but that's it.  I realized that too, people's focus is on themselves, mainly. You have so much insight, so thank you! If you want to talk to someone about life or anything, you can write me, if you are comfortable doing so, of course and if you don't do it, is perfectly fine it's not like I going to be offended or anything like that, because I get us :)"	MelancholyBean	reply	na	na	na	0.995628833770752	strong	no	no	na	socialanxiety

I feel like people like us who have social anxiety are not a problem. It's only a problem because society expects you to be sociable and outgoing etc. This sociable thing is what creating social anxiety. Like you have to be like this and like that and if you're not then there is something wrong with you even though most of us are kind hearted and down to earth. This is just my theory. I'm not saying this is exactly how it is because if you look at it from trauma's side where say you've been bullied or someone implemented a belief inside you because of the things they said or done to you, then you will avoid doing that thing in order to not offend someone or behave according to that belief. Or you can go full careless (not as in being a jerk and causing problems to others) but as in you doing what you feel like without caring what others are thinking through body language or your own negative thoughts. What I also noticed is that when I'm careless and I'm happy, it seems like other people don't like that but that's what I think, it's not based on evidence but rather my own paranoia and assumptions. Now the way I handle this is that the people who I think are giving me dirty looks or don't like me are probably thinking about something else while looking at me or I'm misunderstanding their facial expressions because we think that if someone looks at us in a smiling way then they are good people and if they don't then we assume they are bad people even though it could be because that's how they are or they are just like us etc and has nothing to do with them being bad people or against us etc. So for now I'm working on not caring about what others think or maybe say but most of the time it's just my brain assuming and doing the things I want to do without going in too deep or analyzing. And most people are nice and yes you will find jerks even if you don't look for trouble but if you're nice then others will be nice too. I'm still learning all these from my own experiences and really trying to understand this whole social anxiety thing so I can combat it effectively rather than just going out and not doing any experiment etc.	smalluziverttt	reply	na	na	na	0.9992424249649048	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"I feel you. I get told the same thing. I've tried everything from therapists to exposure, searching the Internet and most of the time it's about ""face your fears"". Like yeah I've done the exposure part for the past 20+ years and it just makes me feel worse. Maybe one day in a week I feel good and get that buzz to go out but after 15 minutes of being outside that buzz fades away and I feel like coming home and shutting the world out. They should just let us be who we are rather than trying to change us into something uncomfortable that we are not but unfortunately in this day and age you have to be ""outgoing"" and ""sociable"" as they say it's so easy or something. These people only know how to talk and will never understand what it's like to have social anxiety. Hell I had my cousin tell me ""oh just think like you don't have social anxiety and you will become better"". I'm like yeah I've tried that countless times and it only works for a couple a second until my automatic thoughts take over me and I have nowhere to hide. Anyone who says things like that like shortcuts to fixing social anxiety is full of garbage and they probably say it because they think you'll be a burden on them because obviously they expect you to go out there and get a job etc so they think you won't be their problem in the future. Obviously we don't even need such people in our lives who treat you for their own benefits or gains. Like I can get a job done as long as I'm not forced to socialize and all that fake garbage."

Definately sounds like you suffer from social anxiety disorder as opposed to common social anxiety/shyness. Otherwise the therapists, coping strategies, etc would've helped you. Have you tried educating your mom on the differences between social anxiety disorder and shyness? It's quite possible that she thinks you're going through a temporary shy phase that will dissappear as you learn to socialize in school. I think you should let her know that when it comes to social anxiety disorder, exposure to social situations (without the guidance of a SAD specialist) is not an effective solution. Hopefully that will convince her to allow you to do online school while you get help from a therapist who specializes in social anxiety disorder.

Idk what to tell ya, what helped me was an old guy coworker who noticed it flat out pointed it out one day, and said “just make it work for you” . Thought about it, and it’s not so bad when you craft it into your persona, make it a part of your personality. You can easily be looked at as “mysterious,” rather than “quiet and weird”, essentially the same thing just a matter of how you play with it.

No I don't feel like that. I'm optimistic that there is some way to fix this social anxiety thing. I just don't know yet what it is or what is the effective strategy etc. Currently I'm looking into human psychology and behavior. I think I might find something there.

"Sorry about that, I can relate. I found out I had lifelong social anxiety disorder after graduating high school, and when I literally printed out the symptoms (that she witnessed throughout my childhood) she still denied I had it and thought I was just shy. Some people just don't get it. 

Maybe you could try casually asking your mom if she was shy in school. If she happens to say yes, you could discuss how long it took her to get over it, coping strategies, etc. Then finally explain how having social anxiety disorder won't allow someone to ""get over it"" like she did. With this empathetic approach, she \*might\* be at least a little more persuaded to the possibility of online schooling."

"Okay so i didnt talked with anyone the last 3 years of my highschool and now its ended and i have to go to a course to learn English. And omg i am sooo stressed out. We will start with an exam the first day and like i will only see them for only 1 year. I am happy with being the quiet antisocial girl BUT this year i want to be confident or just get out of my comfort zone. So please try to answer some of my questions, and oh i know i overthink ;(

1- do i get there early or late?
2- if i go early should i great everyone that enters?
3- if i go late should i just sit and wait for exam to start?

(if i go late i think i wont have a chance to even small talk next time but if i go early i would die from stress)

4- when i start a small talk with someone should i introduce myself or is that unnecessary?
5- should i take their numbers?
6- my smile is awkward but i always smile because i wanna seem polite is that a problem?

Honestly even if no one answers to this atleast i can see what makes me worried lol 😅"	Nightraid9999	post	19.536214686677212	male	White	0.9915617108345032	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety
i think you should get there early so you can introduce yourself to some of your classmates. you can just introduce yourself by saying your name and asking what theirs is. there is nothing wrong with smiling, i’d rather have someone come up and talk to me while smiling than blankly stare at me. i smile awkwardly too but i think it’s better than not smiling at all.

"i got reccomended ""bumble bff"" to make friends, so decided to join. i am a good 3 hours into using the app and after adding the reccomended 4 photos (real life photo that someone else has taken, makeup, no makeup, selfie), my bio about my interests, profile prompts about what i find will make a good friend etc, i still havent found a single match/friend.

some could say its still early days as ive literally just joined, but i never thought i could experience such an increase in anxiety and a huge drop in confidence. the point of this post is that i just feel like more of a loser making an account in the first place because the girls on there who are my age (20) are either in relationships, they all look super intimidating, way more mature than me, are looking for girls to party with (partying is not my thing no matter how much i force myself into it) or put in the bio how they all want to ""skip the small talk, lets just meet up"" and that just terrifies me really. in my head that sounds so fun actually having a friend to do things with but in reality it scares me as its a complete stranger and i'd rather talk to them for a bit first to know if i like them, then make a decision to actually meet up.... or am i asking for too much? ): 

i have made many posts on here about wanting friends so bad, going to my ex-psychologist and venting to her about how alone i am, wanting to die because i cant find anyone who likes me, to then attempt to put myself out there like i was doing tonight and im really not sure what to think.

it doesnt help that all the girls say in the bio to message on instagram but i literally cant bring myself to do that. i have an extremely small follow count of 20 due to it just being my family who follow, so they will obviously think i am a fake and block me. im already thinking of giving up and deleting my account. not sure why i bothered in the first place i feel so shitty "	sonic2cool	post	24.705417015484898	female	White	0.9994643330574036	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety

"That's courageous of you to do that!

To make sure the experience is 100% profitable, make sure that you keep a positive perspective the whole time. Being exposed to what you fear is a great opportinity for that positive perspective to sink in. For ex. repeat to yourself ""I am a nice person that has a lot to offer, i am like the rest of them, and i'm simply trying to have a good time, being alone is fine"", or something along those lines. 

The success of the experience will strongly depend upon you ability to keep that healthy perspective, and not drift towards negativity. But you seem to be solid, you'll be fine ! and enjoy :)"	Akunin1799	reply	na	na	na	0.9970236420631409	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety

48 M. I find it helps to actually tell people how you are feeling. Tell them you are nervous. If you are comfortable enough with the person, tell them you have social anxiety.  When you tell someone your problem it doesn’t seem like as big a problem anymore.  What has also helped me is reading about all the people in the World, including celebrities that suffer from social anxiety. We are not freaks and this has nothing to do with loving yourself.   My suggestion is to start talking to people about your social anxiety. Embrace it.	sagsnag	reply	na	na	na	0.9966631531715393	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"Communication takes practice and the first thing I learned was to stop overthinking and be as honest as possible. Half of what I was worried about was all in my head and the rest could be cleared up with a little communication. 

If you feel your parents don't take things you say the right way, ask them if they understood. If they didn't, clarify, ""That's not what I meant, I actually meant..."" or ""I'm sorry, that's not quite what I meant to convey..."" 

The best advice I can give is to seek professional help through counselling. There are plenty of exercises they can come up with to help you feel safe and build your confidence. Having a few sessions with your parents can also help create a safe environment where you can share your fears and doubts with them. This helped me a lot when I was struggling to feel comfortable around my parents.

Every time I hangout with new people I always rethink about what I said or say. Like the conversation will be over with and the whole time I’m thinking omg why did I say that, they think I’m so stupid or loud. No matter if they seem to enjoy talking to me. I constantly think I’m doing wrong😭 it’s so annoying I wish I wasn’t like this and can just enjoy the night out or make new friends. It’s worse with guys i literally will do or say something so stupid or so un normal thing and like then I feel like the whole vibe is awkward.

"I feel like I might be a little older and wish I could say this is the overnight solution, it isn't and this kind of thing can always be a bit of a struggle, but here is what I can offer. 

How often do you recall a conversation and are critical of someone ELSE in the conversation and not yourself? if the answer is almost never or sometimes, then why would everyone else be so critical of your role in the conversation? Even if you were awkward, do you think they are ruminating about what you said the next day, like you are? 

It's a bit like when you look at a photograph of a group picture and worry about how you look in it, when really everyone else who is looking at the photo is more concerned about how they look. 

Conversations are mostly very transient things. they can be forgotten within minutes.

So with this revelation in mind, take more risks next time, who knows, maybe even embrace it. If you say something wrong or awkward, make it more awkward on purpose. By doing that, you take control of it."	Ihatedishwashers	reply	na	na	na	0.9992620348930359	no	strong	strong	na	socialanxiety

We used to have new sales staff all the time. The boss used to just chuck them in the deep end and expect them to make sales alone.

All people are different though. I worked fast food and people would bring food in all the time to share with the other cooks and carhops, but I always said no thank you so eventually they just stopped asking me.

Yeah I was wondering, in my past job even tho ig people didn't like me bc they misunderstood my lack of social skills with being rude and arrogant they still offered me even if I always refused bc I don't eat sweets but after refusing all the times they always offered me (in this job I'm trying to smile more and not give that impression) , also I have a rest bitch face (which I'm trying to fix my opening my eyes a bit more a have like a soft smile on my face I also intend to buy make up to better off that aspect more) maybe it's that, maybe that was her first job (people in my past job were older) bc she seems to have a lot of experience and she's 21 yo, maybe she doesn't know ig?

I think it's a bit presumptuous to say there are only two possible scenarios, when there could be several. OP mentions other guy was there longer.

"Hello! 

I really struggle to express myself, especially verbally, and I feel like I'm unable to show the world who I am. This leads to me being misunderstood and I feel frustrated because of it.  I'm learning how to be more assertive and open with my feelings but it's slow work.

I’m about to start my final year of college and I’m looking for advice for large lectures. Lecture halls with more than 30 people make me feel physically sick. I’ll go the first week, then basically only ever show up again for exams. Online classes don’t work for me either. I just want to know if/how you all deal with this? I also have adhd which make lectures in general difficult but I find doodling and having fidgets helps, but in a large lecture I’m so scared of having people look at me. it’s all I can do to sit in the very back row and try to breathe. It turns out to be difficult to be successful in college if lectures leave you on the verge of a panic attack. This spring left me on academic probation and I need to get my shit together asap.

That being said if you are in a high school or are about to start college don’t let this scare you, 4 years ago I would never have seen myself getting this far. I basically starved myself the first month of my freshman year because I was so terrified of going to the dining hall alone. I asked for advice on Reddit and was told I needed “professional help”. Jokes on you asshole, I meet with my therapist weekly. We are capable of so much more than we give us credit for!!!	apowers10	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9985644221305847	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"Geez, as I’m starting college in a week, I just stared in awe at “final year of college.” Kudos to you, seriously. I don’t even know how I’ll survive the first day, it’s plaguing my every waking moment right now. I always hear about people dropping out on here, so I guess this gives me a little bit of hope.

It’s interesting how different social anxiety can be for everyone. I feel like a bigger classroom would feel less nerve wracking as it feels less “intimate?” I feel like everyone’s too busy focusing on the lecture and getting their money’s worth (or just bored out of their minds thinking about what they’re going to do after class) to be looking at one specific student that’s also just sitting there minding their own business. It helps me to frequently reassure myself these things, that my fears are more irrational than not. Also, maybe you could reach out for accommodations to have the lecture recorded? There’s a page on my college site where we can apply to have certain accommodations that professors are required to follow if you’re approved. You can just talk about how you need lectures to be recorded for your ADHD if you don’t want to mention social anxiety. That way, if you’re struggling to focus because of your anxiety or ADHD, you can always go home and watch the recorded lectures. 

Medication-wise, I heard the prescription propranolol is great for the physical symptoms of social anxiety. I don’t know anything about the medical stuff, but maybe you can look into it? 

I don’t know anything about college so I hope this wasn’t completely useless. Best wishes for your last year of college and beyond :)"	apowers10	reply	na	na	na	0.9985644221305847	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

 Then this just slammed into me. I keep going around and around where it came from. I had two abusive relationships and have had workplace bullies. I keep wondering if these people have destroyed me.  I think signals started after the first bad relationship.

I always wonder what's the cause of it but nothing really ever happened. I never had issues talking to people betore, and then suddenly one day I did.

What made my anxiety worse is probably the people pointing it out and a few bullying me in high school because of it, but that didn't happen before.

"It's definitely difficult to get a diagnosis. A lot of people with ADHD/ADD have accomplished a lot in their lives but from what I have heard and experienced is that somewhere in their adulthood life will suddenly be too much or things will fall apart. I myself am late diagnosed and even tho I have had it very difficult, I was able to finish my education (almost gave up on it), hold a job for 8 years and run a household. It was only when my life turned upside down again that I actually started looking into my struggles. My forgetfulness, always being late, losing important things, daydreaming - resulting in bumping into a lot of strangers by accident on the streets, lack of motivation to do normal chores etc was seen by surroundings as just who I was. None of them ever stopped to think and ask me ""how does it make you feel?"" Or ""does it make your life difficult?"" Cause it was just who I was. But being 27 and almost having a burn out while having a normal hr work week is obviously not ok. Looking back at my childhood, I am actually surprised no one thought to assess me for this. It was clear as day that I am not neurotypical. But it happens a lot with girls to get a diagnosis later in life. In my case and maybe also yours is also questioned by a lot of people because I am not a chatty, hyperactive person. And most only know ADHD and see the condition only as being a hyperactive person. It helped me to write down all my struggles and go to the doctor with that. I really hope someone will listen to you as you deserve the help and treatment you need! I am sorry for the long reply 😅

PS. Yeah it's still a daily struggle to keep a routine with meditation and journaling for me as well. I go in and out of it but I just tell myself now, that it is ok.

"I (21F) have pretty much had to quit my job because of my shitty manager. I work in retail, with mainly men, which originally freaked me out enough anyway. When I started I tried so hard to come out of my shell and fit in with everyone, and for a while there, it really worked! 
Then one day we got a new manager who I guess decided he disliked me from the get go. He excluding me from conversations and making slide comments about my personality. I’m not sure i’ve ever been disliked by someone for just being myself before? After a while he made me so anxious about not being fun/charismatic enough for him my heart would race and I’d start sweating before I even walked into work every shift. He’s never pulled me aside and addressed anything before, so I don’t even know if I accidentally said/did something to piss him off. 

I’ve worked so hard to overcome my social anxiety over the years but this entire year of weird underhanded bullying by him has pushed me right back into that negative headspace of me questioning my entire personality and is impacting my life outside of work :,) I just want to curl up into a ball and never leave my room!!!

Any tips on not letting it all get to my head? I was doing so good before this and now I’ve noticed i’m just getting more and more awkward again :((("	jonquil_trash	post	15.849702096191036	female	White	0.9994481205940247	na	na	na	9	socialanxiety
"I know it might be hard, but please don't let this asshole dictate your personality. If you can do that, you have sent him a big fuck you without even saying it. Some people are just so cruel for no reason, but honestly what I've observed is that for every asshole i met there are hundreds of nice, amazing, caring people out there. Who all have your back.

Please continue to be yourself, in the grand scheme of things we are all on this floating rock in some largely incomprehendable universe and thoughts of an asshole are so insignificant, so continue being you and give him a big middle finger.

"Get this. The guy is an asshole, as you already know. A capable manager doesn't do that. I had to quit my job back then because I got sick from the covert bullying from a guy like that. He behaved exactly as you describe. One day I couldn't even sleep anymore. I was almost killed by a car due to lack of sleep and had to take medication. I also got racing heart, just like you. 

You should look for another job, because it won't get better as long as you work with this guy. You can report him, but then you have to assume that word will get around internally. 


It doesn't help to mentally distance yourself because you'll run into him every day and it will set your progress back to zero. Anything other than quitting is just enduring."	jonquil_trash	reply	na	na	na	0.9994481205940247	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"I had something similar happen when I worked in retail. I went from being the best employee at the store to the most troublesome in two weeks after the new manager came. I even approached upper management about it, but for some reason they loved this person and they could do no wrong in their eyes. They even publicly humiliated me in a restaurant during a meeting. Needless to say, I found myself in similar shoes where my confidence completely tanked and eventually I couldn't leave the house anymore. 

My advice would be to leave if you don't feel you can approach the new manager and have your concerns heard. No job is worth your mental health. It's perfectly okay to job hop for a while until you find a place you feel comfortable in. 

I know it's hard advice to follow, but don't let one person's poor attitude affect your well-being. You don't have to get along with everyone you work with, you just have to be civil and professional.

Same for me except I work retail where all managers/majority of coworkers are women. Pretty sure they secretly hate me, just being nice because they have to. Really gets me paranoid sometimes.	jonquil_trash	reply	na	na	na	0.9994481205940247	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"I had that happen to me with a female boss. Some people just feel that since they're in charge they should surround themselves with friends/people they can control, and since you demonstrated you were not someone he could control, and you had pivotal connections within your job, they started resorting to some of the cruelest tactics to put you beneath them. What he's doing is called gaslighting and it will get worse if you don't do anything about it. 

I went from being one of the hardest working people to the person that was responsible for all the mistakes that were made- even decisions others made with my permission became solely my responsibility. Friendly coworkers I had worked hard to get along with became distant and in some cases, hostile. Without their help or support, it stopped mattering how hard I worked- I simply could not get everything done, and that was held against me too.

The quitting of a very well liked person whose work ethic had declined ever since the new boss had taken over was also blamed on me. I became more and more awkward, and more and more uncertain as to what to do, and I even started having panic attacks on the way to work.

My confidence tanked, my mental health tanked, and when it became clear they were looking to replace me I simply decided to go elsewhere. I had to do something because at the rate I was going, being let go would have caused me to stop working altogether, regardless of the consequences. I am so happy I chose to leave, because now, I'm treated as if it's unquestionable I belong there, and I feel so much happier to be going to work.

You should never let anyone tell you that you aren't good enough, much less leave you full of dread to be working for them. You need to tell this asshole that you are not going to tolerate his abusive behavior, whether it's going to his boss or quitting outright with a strongly worded letter about how he treated you. You are so strong to have endured this much and to have put yourself out there to get this job, but you don't need to take his abuse- you're an adult, you don't need to keep quiet when someone hurts you.

Don't let him bully you. :)"	jonquil_trash	reply	na	na	na	0.9994481205940247	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"I'm sorry you went through all that. Remember it's not your fault and you did nothing wrong. I hate people like that. My previous boss used to treat me badly too and I think the reason he treated me that way was because I was too nice. I would always say yes and never stood up for myself and because of that he manipulated, gaslighted and took advantage of me. I would be on the shop floor working up and down while other workers were just chilling and having conversations about random topics and messing about on their phones in the office sat there chilling. 90% of the time I was serving customers and he would never tell the other workers to serve but very rarely to make it look like he's being fair when I clearly knew he wasn't. He would say things like ""you're lazy"" ""you don't know how to work"" ""you're useless"" and the reason he said all that is because he wanted me to believe that I'm truly not a good worker so he can take advantage of me more by making me work more. He would call me in his office and make fun of me in front of other colleagues. One of the colleague even ganged up on me with him and made humiliated comments. Now this colleague was super insecure and jealous so the reason he ganged up on me was because he wanted to look better in the boss's eye. The boss even made him turn against me with false accusations so this guy had zero respect for me. From there on I started to give less care about this one colleague because I thought he was a nice guy but he showed his true colours. But most of the colleagues were fake there anyway so I knew I was in the wrong job and a toxic work environment. If they were real they would speak up against the boss and stand up for me but they never did that because obviously it's better for them. They don't have to work hard like I was doing. So I secretly started to look for another job and once this job was secure, I openly in front of everyone said this to my low life boss. "" I'm done working here and here's why. You never treated me with respect. You made me work more than all these people here while they just sat at the back of the office chilling and having fun. You humiliated me in front of colleagues and customers. You underpaid me while all these lots are getting more money than me despite me putting twice as much work in. You never truly appreciated me except fake respect just to take advantage of me more. You made me overwork while letting other colleagues easy. I don't need your fake respect or this job. I'm leaving."" Best decision of my life. The only regret I have is I should have left that hell earlier. I heard some of the colleagues left from there after I left because obviously I'm no longer there to do their job. What I've learned from all these is that you have to stand up for yourself even if your colleagues are nice because they probably are being nice because they are taking advantage of you or it's benefitting them in some way. But most importantly stand up against your boss or manager. If they don't change even after you call them out then you're wasting your time and energy. My current boss is super nice, understanding and chilled and he knows about my social anxiety as well. This is what I call a healthy workplace. Respect yourself and take care of yourself.

The thing is that I'd like to develop and improve my conversations, topics and such because i'm going out of my comfort zone to meet strangers but after some basic talk, i'm totally blank and i don't know what to talk about. Is also any place, as a psychologist or whatever, in which i could practice and get help or guidance about my impossibility to talk?

"You might just be shy if you don't have anxiety when you talk to new or familiar people. Whether you have anxiety or not, you can certainly speak with a counselor to help you gain the confidence you would like.  I wouldn't recommend a psychologist because they focus more on mental illness and medications; it doesn't sound like that would help you in the situation you've described. 

If you want to better your communication skills you can check out Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, and YouTube. Vinh Giang on YouTube is great for public speaking but his tips work well in normal conversations too. There are a lot of free resources out there, you can check out emotional intelligence as well to help you better your communication skills once you gain a little confidence.

"I can't stop cringing to myself. It's actually an issue, I gotta type this out and get this off my chest. 
My brain turns off when I'm the judge and have to read the cards, everyones looking at me, im not the best at reading outloud especially to a group. I was playing a game with my boyfriend's family and this is like the 2nd time meeting them and first time meeting his brother. 7 total people.
I mispronounce one of the answer cards twice. I'm like 25 y'all. Then my next go at being judge it was a card saying something, I can't even remember now because I honestly wasn't even paying attention to it, man. I was so focused on how I looked to them that I wasn't even reading the cards I guess. It was something inappropriate with your brothers friends and for some fucking reason I said boyfriend's friends and they were joking about it being like ooooooo what friends have you shown her and I was just like ""wait what no im sorry no I didn't mean that"". I was obviously flustered. Then the game went on and I was sitting there like normal on the outside but I kept squeezing my boyfriend's leg because I was trying extreamly hard not to cry. While also keeping light hearted convo amd smiling and laughing. I felt like if I had showed any ounce of panic I'd die. I held a gun to my own head about not making a bad impression. I just wanted to not exist. My boyfriend knew something was up and kept trying to ask me but I just winked at him and kept holding and occasionally squeezing his hand under the table. He got the hint and stopped asking but held my hand when I reached out and such. I don't think anyone else noticed anything at all. It felt like those scenes in Oppenheimer when (spoiler????) the rooms shaking around him and he's just there staring off or listening to people speak to him. But it wasnt over building a bomb it was over not being able to read and saying dumb shit.

Why am I like this? Why do I have to even care this much? Why did I say that!?  Its so exhausting because every social interaction goes this way, and its hard going into situations knowing its enviable. Ugh.

I have something similar. When the group is bigger like 5+ people I’ll stress and think about every word I say. Talking to friends and people that I already know for some time is fine tho, most of the time. But try no to overthink it, to just a conversation and girls, what’s different about them compared to your friends in the communication field. So try to be calm and say so shit, they’ll probably don’t care and the conversation will go on.

"For the last 8 months (since January this year that is) one this has been very constant in my life and that is, my best friend who has been my best friend for 10+ yrs has other friend that he goes out with and posts the pics on social media, and then I feel shit about myself for the entire day. And Oh God the grief, 'why can't I have fun?' , 'Why can't I make friends as such?'. Sometimes I feel like he posts only to make me feel jealous. My family has done a lot for him since the death of his father and now he doesnt even consider me when going out. It has happened 7-8 times now and I cant take it anymore. My family also sees these posts and then ask me where are your friends.. I don't know how to tell them what am going through. I am currently studying for a professional course and I have online classes so I don't have to go out a lot. Also there are a lot of other students in a online telegram group with whom I never talk. I had tried to talk to them before but it didn't work. All my other acquaintances joke about how I have to never go out, talk to people and I just have to laugh it off but they don't know how much that hurts me. 


How I imagine having really good friends is, It isn't something you do desperately, you just show up everyday and become friends and it's a sort of a flow. You don't need to deliberately do it, it happens on its own. Social anxiety is like the resistance to that flow. 

Having good friends is an amazing thing that a lot of people take for granted. Only if they could see what lonely people go through , then they would value it.

Start with a cousin or a sibling, if you are close with them, you can always gain their trust to talk about anything like friends usually do. Try an improv class to improve with stage freight. I personally do a martial arts and I've met great people that I can trust. Try volunteering to meet new people and eventually become friends. If you struggle with SA from traumatic events in the past, you can always reach out to organizations that can help with that. Sometimes they'll put you in a peer support group, so you can meet people experiencing something similar as you.	Possible_Drummer_296	reply	na	na	na	0.9993897676467896	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

Him having other friends is the point though right? I'm not saying to just hang out with your friend, but to meet and hopefully befriend his friends. If you want to make more friends, this is the absolute best way. Social anxiety makes it difficult to make friends but it isn't some kind of magic, you just need to learn how to do it.

Can you talk more easily with girls though?	throwaway1636843015	reply	na	na	na	0.999411940574646	no	no	strong	na	socialanxiety
What worked for me is using a dating app. It created some distance which I initially needed to feel comfortable 'approaching' someone (online). I then met my boyfriend, talked to him online and after that met in person. He noticed how anxious I was but after getting more comfortable with each other (not without some awkward moments) that anxiety disappeared. It is all about breaking that barrier, learning to trust and learning that being anxious is okay. The right person for you will love you regardless and guide you through it. I agree with another comment that recommended mentioning it to people you meet. It might be scary to do so, but at least people won't start to assume things about you that aren't true.

This is always difficult but - do they know about your anxiety? For the few close friends I have - they know and it helps them better understand that it isn’t “weirdness” but is an actual disability/disorder.

"Hmmm, keeping convo going is like adding on, asking questions about the other person's responses or reacting to them with your own experiences. Like, if they say they've had a good day, ask them what the best part was or tell them how your day has gone. Keeping a conversation going is tough, and sometimes the conversation just stops and doesn't start back up until the next time you see the person, because neither of you have anything else to say that day or you're just not in the mood to talk.

My guess, the symptoms developed because you're worried about how people perceive your body.

My friend had something similar. When the school was over and he wasn’t stressed about going to school tomorrow, he was fine. But when he knew that he’ll need to see people in the school and talk to them/teachers he would continue with his ED. Maybe try to switch to online school only if possible.

"I’m 20f and have a chance at a new job starting tomorrow (trial). It’s in childcare which is new to me, and I haven’t had a job in over a year. 

I had a show around the premises the other day and I hadn’t slept all night out of anxiety and pure fear of the whole thing. When shown around, most of the girls working there just kind of stared at me whenever I was introduced and said hi. I even faked the whole outgoing semi confident voice and they all just kind of looked at me.

Obviously i’m sure some of them may just be shy too, but either way, on my first day, how do I even talk to them?

I have super sensitive triggers around awkward social situations and if I sense slight rejection from someone like them not talking to me or people staring/it getting awkward because i’m a newbie, I feel panic attacks come along instantly and i’m so scared i’m going to panic and have to leave on my first day!

Try not to overanalyze things and keep yourself busy. The less time you're distracted by checking what everyone else is doing/saying that is overall better for you going forward. Keep conversation minimal but polite for a bit and the more you get used to your role and the people around you the more you can observe how to act in the future. It's all about distracting yourself from what's going on around you but also keeping it respectful and professional. You're there to do a job, get paid and go home.

"Childcare is a pretty rough industry. There's a lot going on at any given moment, so don't put too much stock into your coworkers not jumping at every opportunity to make you feel welcome.

You're there to do your job and while it would be nice for everyone to be friends and get along it's not always feasible. Don't put on an exhausting act, just be yourself and do your best! 

I used to feel similar in social situations and honestly, the only thing that's helped has been putting myself out there to build my confidence.

I did actually have a weird experience making a friend just recently though, but he's way older than me so it's a bit weird to hang out in person.

"Backstory/vent: I have extreme attachment issues (I have BPD), as well as extreme social anxiety. I’ve allowed myself to become completely dependent on my boyfriend, while isolating myself from the rest of the world. To be honest, I’ve isolated myself from others for longer than I’ve known him. Social anxiety has prevented me from so many things. ………..Anyways, this is to say that I have no friends. I reach out to old friends and people I know, and vice versa… but then I never make plans because I’m too nervous. I just tell them I’ll check my schedule and often cancel or don’t reply for so long and say I forgot. 

So, my boyfriend is on a trip for a month and I feel the most alone I’ve ever felt. I’ve been camping out at my dad’s house for the comfort, making trips back to my own place but not being able to stay for long. I feel pathetic coming back, but it’s the only place I don’t feel alone. 

…………. So today on another shameful trip back to my dad’s place, I ran into my friend’s sister! I quickly warned her about the off mood I was in.. but that was very quickly changed! Usually I am super awkward, but this time I had the best conversation I’ve had in sooo long!!!! We talked for the entire 1hr bus ride about so many things. Then I got to see my friend, who picked her sister up from the bus terminal! It was awesome, nothing has changed since highschool. We plan to meet up for a drink this week. 

When I got home, my mind started thinking things like “oh god what if she thought I was weird?”. BUT THEN my friend sent me a super lovely text about how it was great to see me, and how her sister thinks I’m cool. And how we’ve got to plan something very soon because we have lots to talk about. Yay :’)

So was wondering if a fair few people experienced this as well?	Fenice101	post	21.692860821458474	male	White	0.014843573793768883	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety

You’ve got to take that power back, I used to get tormented on a building sites but eventually i got so angry id just start firing shots left right & centre. Once you allow yourself and focus on not just defending yourself but pushing that mf back it’ll change your life. Put them on the back foot, whether it’s their character their look, weight w/e.

Stand up for yourself. As a victim of the same kind of bullying in grade school, I wish I had punched my bully back in the face. It's such a powerful message to the bully and yourself too. The bully understands you won't take shit and you show yourself how much you respect yourself. And another sign of giving in is that you can't tell your bully to stop. I would always think that I won't let him hit me today but I wouldn't be able to do shit against him( he wasn't even physically strong). If you feel such powerlessness, you are letting your bully eat your self esteem. It might feel passive and 'messing around' but it's detrimental.	ansh_757	reply	na	na	na	0.9993094205856323	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"I’m the kind of person who doesn’t talk to anyone I don’t know, as I get anxious my mind gets clouded, and I don’t know what to say. In a conversation with a stranger my heart races I get palpitations and I feel ill and dizzy. I go through my life trying to avoid people as much as humanly possible, however I feel like Neo in the film the matrix. When the normal people turn into the agents and are then attracted to Neo like a magnet, and then approach him to give him GRIEF. I just feel like I have a magnetism that attracts people who are going to make me feel uncomfortable, when all I want is to be left alone.

For example I needed to pick up a few things from the local shop near my house today. The shop is quit close, so I looked out of my window to make sure that the coast is clear, and then set out. I get anxious just walking thinking that I’ll bump into someone, see someone or at worst get stuck walking behind someone who walks slow. Getting stuck behind someone and trying to find a way past them to get to my destination is my worst fear. As I don’t want them to think I’m some sort of creep or something who’s following them, when in reality all I want is to get past them so I can buy some milk and other necessities from the shop.

So anyways I’m half way to the shop, I turn the corner and I see her, the catalyst to my soon to be encounter. It was an old lady with a crutch and yes she was very slow. So seeing her from a distance with horror in my mind, I decide to slow my pace so I don’t get stuck walking too close behind her. All is well and she will soon turn left, which will give me the chance to walk straight, cross the road and then walk left to the shop. This was my plan to bypass having to walk past her. 

However as I’m walking I see a man in front on the other side of the road, and he’s looking my way. I looked at him but he is quit the distance away, so I’m not sure if he’s looking at me. But then I hear he’s voice shouting to the old lady saying, “OI LUV, ARE YOU OK?, THERES A BLOKE WALKING BEHIND YOU!” 

I was absolutely speechless as he broadcasted this by shouting aloud for everyone to hear! This situation sucked so Bad for me, as I felt like I was being looked at like a criminal and was being persecuted. I felt like he thought I was gonna steal her purse or something. 

I couldn’t even walk to my local shop without someone making me feel uncomfortable, anxious and stressed out. It makes me not want to leave my house, as situations like that are soul crushingly stressful for me, and make my anxiety skyrocket.

Anyone else have any similar experiences?"	MrGarety	post	22.20258035165666	female	White	0.9851544499397278	na	na	na	5	socialanxiety

"That sucks and would be really offputting but put it down to a once off bad timing type situation that probably won't ever happen again.

Always keep to your normal pace if you can. If there is someone walking super slow ahead of you, best to speed up and pass them, or it you can't, try stop e.g. tying shoelaces to kill some time and create distance.

I can see it would look weird from that guys perspective if you are walking behind an old woman at the same, really slow, pace. 

I hate getting stuck walking behind people, especially women as you can become paranoid easily that you are looked at as being a potential criminal. 

I recently got stuck behind a woman walking home who had just exited a gym. I tried to speed past but then she did the same when she noticed/heard me I guess! That was awkward as I was now really close and walking fast but couldn't pass as she was moving too fast! Luckily I was walking the dog so time to pretend he is stopping to look around so she would fuck off. Speeding up doesn't always work I guess.

"I don't know if I'm autistic. I have never been diagnosed as such. Was talking in a group earlier. It's true I struggle with group communication but I put myself out there and make an effort to socialize. What I have the tendency to do is state the obvious. It's my way of thinking out loud. Like I was at a restaurant, and I randomly said ""do I have to eat, as I just had breakfast not long ago""... This girl burst out laughing....Bear in mind some restaurants do not let you sit if you don't order anything. I know we were in a big group of people so it might not have mattered, but sometimes I say these things anyway. Maybe I am slow and on the spectrum. I felt the way this girl laughs at certain things I say is particularly condescending...almost like she is saying ""yes, you are weird, you talk weird, I'm so much smarter""... I feel Americans do this a lot more, because they see themselves as socially superior... the social version of ""cool""! Everyone else is weird for talking or thinking differently.

a little help for you:
I had a teacher who used to slur his words a lot and stutter a bunch. He had some kind of facial ticks and everyone laughed at him in the first few periods. But after a while it just stopped and everyone took him serious because they got used to him. 

Maybe some people are slow or not that smart or weird but so what?

Just because you're maybe a little slow, doesn't mean you should be laughed at or made fun of.

I put this down to lack of or different social experiences rather than a learning disability.

I'm just putting myself in someone else's shoes. If someone was at a restaurant and said what I said, maybe I would chuckle a little (coz of your explanation). But this girl was laughing as though I said something incredibly strange or unusual...or stupid! 

I have a tendency to say things for clarity or stating the obvious. This is like me saying everything I think. Sometimes I do this to avoid awkward silence or just keep the conservation going.

"Is there something that can mimic social anxiety disorder while having the core traits including substance use, but not always fully established.

For example: On x days / in x moments I am feeling extroverted talkative in a certain group of friends I gathered around me. On x days and most moments I don't want to talk to anyone anymore and spend my day most of the room, anxious leaving the room and even going upstairs to the bathroom. On these days even a kind of mutism (not speaking) occurs where I won't talk to anyone except through writing if necessary.

So the traits of shyness are not really given, while still experiencing extreme anxiety on days, while actually still not being naturally introverted.

To sum it up:

• Changes between moments of extroversion/introversion
• Still having certain friends for certain activities and able to maintain those relationships
• Mutism at times 
• Extreme anxiety and social isolation at most days of the week
• substance use in extreme moments as coping
• Some days without leaving room
• Changes of diet
• Tiredness / Motivation switching

"I think I’ve always been socially anxious. When I was in nursery  I’d have constant peeing problems because I was too scared to ask to go to the toilet. I had to get an ultrasound it got that bad!

In reception I made my mum talk to the teacher about me being in a small group practicing spelling. I thought if I got something wrong on my whiteboard everyone would laugh at me. 

In year one we were sat in a big circle and the teacher asked a maths question. Someone whispered me the answer so I put my hand up and said it and it was wrong. The whole class laughed at me and everything was in slow motion. 

My attendance was always really low throughout primary school as I used to cry before going to school (it was a panic attack but I didn’t know at that point.) so my mum let me stay off school because I got myself in such a state. 

Then in secondary school I had constant panic attacks and couldn’t attend from age 14+. I’m 23 at the moment and it’s hit me hard again.

I think my social anxiety started when my father passed away when I was 10. Then, it progressively got worse once I started gaining weight. At work, I avoid all social situations. I always pretend to go to the restroom so I don't ride the elevator with anyone. Currently, I am revamping my resume so I can find a remote job. I hate being in crowded stores because in 10 minutes, I am ready to run out of the store. My social anxiety is super severe around men, probably why I have been out of the dating game for a while.

Went from seeing my group of friends all day in school to be completely alone because we all started college/work, travelling to another city to study in a place where I didn't know anyone, etc. In class I try my best to not being ankward but it's hard. I remember first day the teacher asked we choosed this career and I remember when I was speaking my voice started breaking and my legs shaking, and had a image of my classmates staring at me, I almost cried after finishing.

My daily life outside of college it's not better too. Overall I'm okay in my house for obvious reasons, but when I'm outside I'm nerveous all the time. I can't even go to a grocery store and act like a normal person because I start speaking loud and fast, and I have the tendency of repeating the same short words. Heck I can't even walk on the street in peace because I fear people think I'm weird.

Trying to meet new people now feels like a huge challenge (tho luckily enough I was able to make a good friend in college and we hang out sometimes), specially because I care a lot about first impressions. My family telling me to act as an adult when no one taught me how to be one. It's been worse lately because I have a younger brother who's a extrovert and has 0 problem socialising, while I'm a 22 shy introvert student who tries to earn money by doing small jobs and the idea of having her first ''serious'' job scares her, and my parents can't stop making comparisons.

It sucks, and sometimes I wish I was a different person."	spanishbombs123	reply	na	na	na	0.9982605576515198	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"i was always really quiet in in public and around anyone except my immediate family, before elementary school all i can remember is talking awfully low, only talking to the few friends i had if they started the conversation, never raising my hand, and not singing during our ""concerts"" for grandparents and such. during elementary school i think i just got known as the shy kid, and so everyone was chill with me but still interact with me cause i guess kids are usually more social. middle school and up that stuff stopped and i didnt know what to do and started losing contact with friends and becoming more withdrawn. i had no idea what was going on with me so it just worsened with time unfortunately. im unsure whether the ""shy personality"" was the start of it, or if i was just like that but was never able to grow out of it due to the SA developing. i assume there was various factors or experiences at a young age that caused me to worry more about how i appear and act around others, wish i could've known then though"	spanishbombs123	reply	na	na	na	0.9982605576515198	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

I remember having it at like 4 years old. I don't really know why other than genetics. But I was pretty lucky in elementary school because my best friend basically took all the initiative and made me her friend, so I had a friend all throughout elementary school. I don't know why she chose me but I'm glad she did. However, we grew apart come middle school and having no real friends made my social anxiety a lot worse, and not even because I wanted a friend - I was actually fine by myself - but because I knew everyone else was judging me because I didn't have any friends, especially at lunch when I sat at a table by myself.	spanishbombs123	reply	na	na	na	0.9982605576515198	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"I think it started when I was 3 years old and I was in preschool with kids that seemed to be very different from me. Maybe I had social anxiety before, but I have almost no memories dated so far in the past.

I had a single friend that I already knew because she was the daughter of my parents’ friends, and I was staying mostly alone, away from the noise, scared about other kids’ behaviour. Many kids were also cruel, or they lacked self awareness and were following the behaviour of some popular kid without questioning it. 

I was staying mostly alone, but I wasn’t left alone. I frequently had to fight to defend myself, driving aggressive kids away and discouraging them from bothering me.

After some time I was afraid of doing anything, while I was seen by others. Now, many years after, I am still scared of doing almost anything, but luckily not as much as in the past."	spanishbombs123	reply	na	na	na	0.9982605576515198	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

I also just didn't know how to make friends. I remember trying to make friends with this kid but just ended up annoying her. I did everything by myself in school.

As a kid, I was also anxious around people, even family. I had an especially hard time asking for things

I think I’ve had it since my early school years. I’m not sure exactly when it started. I can remember feeling anxious around age 9 or 10 but I think it must have started before that, because I know I barely spoke at school. Kids would ask me why I didn’t talk. I was also afraid to ask to go to the bathroom and wet myself more than once :/ Outside of school I was pretty normal and known for being silly among my family and close friends.

"Same as you, it feels like I’ve been anxious since toddler stage. It’s so weird because why was I so afraid of judgment as a 5 year old? I was scared of what people thought of me. Also your peeing story unlocked my own peeing memory lol. I peed my pants in like kindergarten or smth cause I was also too scared to go to the toilet and I didn’t even tell anyone cause I felt embarrassed until the teacher found out cause, wet pants. I think I was too weirdly self aware for a child. Like why was I embarrassed of being a kid doing kid things, while I was a kid. This anxiety has haunted me throughout my entire life and naturally many days in school, my stress was through the roof. I think that’s why I have grey hairs at such a young age.

Not exactly sure. But I was 3 or so I had kidney cancer and as result lost my right kidney. Well this to my parents basically babying me a lot more than usual. Combine that with an undiagnosed learning disability and it was a recipe for disaster. Although I don't 100% blame my parents. But they did do a lot of stuff for me Way longer than they should have. My dad has apologized and basically said he wasn't the dad he could have been. But I don't blame him he was a great dad One I would hope to be someday. Basically my parents weren't as strict as I should have been in terms of doing stuff on my own. So I never got practice with certain social skills. To this day I hate to make phone calls. I specifically searched for car insurance with no phone call involved. Although I will say I have improved quite a bit that's due to me working retail and kind of living on my own.	spanishbombs123	reply	na	na	na	0.9982605576515198	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

I’ve always been somewhat introverted. Throughout most of elementary school I was friendly with most of my classmates but never close enough to the point of hanging outside of school or us being considered best friends. Through the end of elementary school and around the time I began middle school I began to hang out with people less and less and I noticed people would start treating me differently or looking at me with pity because of how often I would choose to be alone. Ever since then I’ve met self conscious, afraid to be seen by myself around other people I knew and overtime carrying on conversations just got more and more difficult. Now I’m a junior in high school, and not much has changed since then aside from the fact that at least now I don’t get anxiety attacks over every social interaction that I happen to be in.	spanishbombs123	reply	na	na	na	0.9982605576515198	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"I think i have 2 main causes of social anxiety
1. When my phone broke, I had to bring this shitty nokia phone to school and since there was nothing to do on it, I would just record myself making funny faces and acting like an idiot. My PE teacher would always ask me to bring my phone to his office even if i didn't use it, but he didn't tell that to kids that were using their phones, only mine which i didn't even use (note that you can't set a password on this phone). It was pretty suspicious to see the PE teacher and the kid who knew everything about technology in his office alone all the time. As days/weeks were passing by, I'd see my friends including the teacher talk behind my back and laugh, and later i found out that he was showing the videos of me acting like an idiot to the whole class. Ever since that happened everyone would make jokes about it and that's when i think my social anxiety started to form

"Mine started as a child. I was physically bullied when I started secondary school, around 12,13. The first time a girl fought me she ran up behind me and punched in my neck then started kicking me. Didn’t know the girl at all and everyone (all girls school) just stood around watching us and laughed. The girl laughed it off and asked me to write the apology letter the principal told her to write me. She wanted me to write an apology to myself. Parents were called in and my mother (a heartless one in her own way) said I was being too sensitive about the whole thing.

Since then I cannot be in the center of rooms where anyone’s behind me. Im a literal wallflower, for my safety. I’m an adult now but still somewhat triggered. I also stay away from groups of school aged teenagers. In my country school children wear uniforms so they’re easy to spot and stay away from.

" At the age of 25 I have a pretty good understanding of how social interactions will go for me almost everytime. People only seem to tolerate me and can barely fake a smile in my presence. Even if I’m being polite, professional, and to myself people find something negative to say about me. They’ll say “he’s so weird, he’s a loser, he’s creepy”. Expressing my concerns about this I’ve been told “open up more, smile, be funny, be outgoing” after putting this more socially desirable mask on I STILL WAS negatively criticized. I was called annoying, and had people roll their eyes at me, and say they can’t stand me. It’s clear no matter how I try to fit in socially it’s just not accepted by people. It’s NOT FUN feeling like you’re walking on eggshells with everyone you talk to as to not offend them. People say “you shouldn’t be concerned about that stop people pleasing” then ironically also say “you need to be socially aware of how your words and behaviors are affecting others” it’s fucking draining. It’s a game I always lose and find no joy in. I don’t feel like I should be playing Detroit become human with every fucking word I speak. 

I realize because I’m ugly everything I do is perceived negatively and it's made me not want to bother talking to people or open up to anyone ever again. It's the same pattern, eventually everyone starts hating and talking shit about me. Literally EVERY TIME. it's not fun. I just want a handful of people I can trust to like and appreciate me, a group of people who I can joke around with without having to be conscious of everything I say and wondering ""omg do they hate me bc I said that""

"I don't disagree. But I know folks like us do over think things sometimes. I grew up, and am still a very skinny man, and have always been bullied.

I am now a manager in my career, and I always assume the guys are hating on me behind my back, when they are not 95% of the time. They used to be peers, and now I am ""above them"" so to speak, so I expect their poop to run up hill, but it's always in my head, and occasionally I don't deal with them perfectly, or say something in a way that wasn't presented properly, so a Lil bit of negative feedback should be expected.

"i don't experience this anymore, but i was wondering if other people could relate to dreading lunch at school? lunch is usually the most anticipated part of the day (since most friendship groups can finally join up and chat).

but when you have no friends, it's sort of just a rub in the face that you have nobody.

the obvious option would be to talk to others, but my social anxiety was dreading that i wouldn't be interesting enough, or i'd sit too strangely, or i'd chew too weirdly. 

so i chose the second best option (at least in my head) and ate in the bathroom stalls instead.

i loved it at first, since i could eat without being judged and i didn't have to formulate small talk with anybody. but eventually i became more miserable, as i realised how sad it was, and i just felt more upset and pathetic.

can / could anyone else relate to this? because when i try to ask anyone i know irl, they all seem quite shocked at the idea and ""thought it was only something done in movies""."	woomanna	post	16.21409606861372	female	White	0.9986020922660828	na	na	na	54	socialanxiety
I used to eat in the bathroom & , sometimes, school is not your friend & its okay to not have a lot of friends. You’re still young & you have plenty of time to form real bonds with people who understand & appreciate you. Do what you’re comfortable doing & if eating in the stall helps, then do it. If you’d rather sit in the field alone , do that. If you’d rather sit in the office or with a teacher, do that. Life is too short to focus on what others *might* be thinking of you. Dont limit your happiness for the sake of other’s judgment.

We weren't allowed to go anywhere but the cafeteria for lunch. I didn't have any friends in school and I didn't like eating school lunches so I never ate and always sat alone.

"I totally relate!!!

For me it's the lunch at work. It's a small company so we all sit together at this table for (8 people or so). I feel so trapped. Dreading every moment of it, waiting for the sheer horror someone might ask me a question and I might turn red for no apparent reason at all.

What I sometimes do is, eat my meal rather quick and then pretend to get a phone call, answer the phone and walk out lol. Then I just hide in one of the toilets until I know the lunch is over. I come back walking into the office pretending to be very busy with the phone, like I had a very important call lol (no one calls me ever).

Last week instead of normal lunch at work, we had a lunch planned at a restaurant in town as a ""goodbye thing"" for 2 colleagues that were leaving.

my anxiety was so bad that i was very close to dropping out until they pulled me from my regular classes and gave me workbooks to do in the library alone. 

i moved to europe for a year in grade 10 with my family and i couldn’t go to class because i would get hot flashes and panic attacks afterwards- so again, more workbooks but this time with the very sweet principle who made me feel at ease. 

honestly dude? it sucks a lot. if you can, go outside and have lunch under a tree with a book or homework just to seem like you’re busy. i do want to say though, if you can try to stick it out in the cafe. maybe people will come up to you for sitting alone? i used to do that to others when i had my little group of friends. you got this and know you’re not alone struggling with this!"	woomanna	reply	na	na	na	0.9986020922660828	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

I absolutely dreaded lunch. It was the hellest time of the school day besides the morning before school and the walk into the school grounds. You're definitely not alone in this experience. I would do it so often. There were many things to worry about. Like groups of friends coming in and making you feel paranoid that they will humiliate you and accuse you of taking a shit (as if that is a crime lol) I don't know why time would go so slow, too. Like I would my checking my phone the whole time waiting for class to start so I can blend in again. But I felt so much safer doing this, rather than my classmates and favourite teachers seeing me be myself. I didn't like how sometimes my classmates would come up to me and ask me if I was okay and I could sense that they didn't give a shit that I was alone anyways so it was humiliating. Yeah so you're definitely not alone. You're not pathetic, you're braver than anyone for turning up to school when it feels absolutely dreadful. Notice that people with social anxiety are so brave, others would simply skip school when their friends are away. I mean, I would have loved to do that but I couldn't and it would become a bad habit.

"A few months ago, I used to read stuff like this and feel better, even hopeful. But since I started dating, I've got this feeling like it all applies to everyone but me. Like, I'm just unlovable, whether romantically or even as a friend. It's like I'm this repulsive force that's wiping out any progress I had in life. It's weird, you know? I was actually happy, and then reality hits, and I'm like, ""Oh, this is who I am and what life is.""

I’ve been in therapy for almost 2 years, read many self help books, tried changing my mindset, medication, etc. 

People are always saying, ""Focus on yourself and your friends."" But come on, I've been all about me for 23 years, and I don't even have friends around. I'm solo 24/7. Everything – work, meals, even crying – it's just me. I'm seriously in a one-person show here.

So, I caved and got back on the dating apps. Without them, I felt this literal chest pain from loneliness. Crazy, right? Having someone to text kind of helps, even if some of them are pretty rude or would ghost me after five minutes in person. But it backfired. I feel even more alone now. Ugh, I'm tired. It's been four years of complete solitude. No one gets it. If I just vanished, who'd even notice? There's no one I talk to every day or see regularly.

I'm drained. I've tried everything, given it my all, and my situation's just stuck. Nothing changes. It's like I've hit a wall. Maybe some folks are destined for a solo, short-lived existence. I'm at a point where I don't know what else to do. It's like some people just don't get a break and aren't meant to be happy.

I'm starting to think maybe I should just accept it. People drift away anyway, so why not let myself drift from me? Sounds crazy, but I've practically given up on myself already.

I don't get how people can be so pumped about the future or find happiness. Every time I think I'm happy, it's like I'm tricking myself or living in a daydream. The moment I snap back to reality, it's this wave of hating life and feeling utterly alone. And I've got to ride this for maybe another 60 years? All on my lonesome? Man, that's rough."

I think you need to find a new therapist ASAP. If you have told them all this and they’ve done nothing they are clearly not helping. If you haven’t told them you need to show them this post, literally show them on your phone or read it out to them. They cannot help if they don’t know the truth about how you feel. 23 is young, VERY young, and you still have a lot of life ahead of you.

This hits home. Back then I also felt worthless and unlovable. If I could just give up my life to save someone else's. But this knife in the heart, I knew if I felt this way, there must be someone else out there who feels the same. This is one of the reasons why I keep pushing myself. For my future partner. And for everyone else who's been feeling this way. To be one more story to show that life can be turned around. That gives life meaning.

"  Oh boy, here we go: Another post about someone in high school not making friends and not getting bitches, prepare yourself. 

  I've always been an isolated kid, sure I have ADHD and Asperger's , but I've always been a loner, that's never changed, and has become a key characteristic of mine. I grew up Isolated with PLENTY of trauma (I won't get into it because I don't want this post to be a whole ass essay.) but I want you guys to imagine something, imagine feeling you're having an out of body experience every time you talk to someone you're even slightly uncomfortable with, sound crazy? I know it does but it's what I feel every day I go to high school. I don't know what the hell causes that but it's a little weird right? 

&#x200B;

  My parents tell me PLENTY about how ""Oh you're just a teen, your mind is a little wacky"" which I get, trust me, I get it--- but when you haven't made a SINGLE friend in over 5 years and have gotten no guys it's a little bit of an issue, right? Idk why I'm taking this post so seriously, it'll probably get banned off of some random ass rule I forgot, but eh as long as someone sees it, I'm fine. 

&#x200B;

  Sorry this post doesn't have much of a direction, this is more of a venting post I'll admit, I just need people OTHER than my parents or a counselor that can somewhat relate to me. But yeah, along with the EXTREME social anxiety, I've had a LOT of violent thoughts, like wanting to stab myself, kill myself, all the nasty things you can think of! And I just want it to go away, I have a hell of a lot of problems it feels like, I just want to know if someone can relate. Sorry this post has been so damn long, if You're reading this, glad you made it this far! 

&#x200B;

  Throughout my life I've always hated every fiber of my being, so much hate for myself that I wouldn't channel into my worst enemy. I don't know WHAT it is that causes it, perhaps it's my chubby body, perhaps I'm ugly, maybe it's because I don't make friends and seemingly have a lot of issues. I don't really know WHY I hate myself, but I do! I seem to have never found a skill which plays into my self image of being worthless (Damn this post got dark.), but I've never heard of anyone with the same amount of self hatred that I have, that's how bad it is. The only people I've come to care about are my parents, who I rely on for quite literally everything (I know, shocking.)

&#x200B;

  But yeah, social anxiety has affected my life in MANY negative ways, including me not wanting to approach people in conversation, out of body weird experiences when I talk to people, no friends (not yet), body dysmorphia, acting like a robot in public, showing no emotion in public, and me not loving myself EVER in my entire life so far. Sorry I went a little off topic a couple times (Mods don't blow up my house, please) but I needed to vent it out somewhere (There is probably a better sub to post this to, but social anxiety is a big problem for me so I decided to post it here.), but anyways, I hope someone can relate to my post and maybe give some insight into what exactly I'm going through. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, uh, I have no creative way to end this post so goodbye!

Sighs, Everytime I go outside to a store since I'm a homebody feels so uncomfortable. Freaking keep looking everywhere in circles and makes me feel like a weirdo 🤦. I mean I just always feel like somebody is watching me. Also I feel like my thoughts and vision aren't coordinating. Not sure if this is some form of anxiety. I understand that in order to reduce anxiety, we must go out of comfort zone and embrace those situations. But everytime I tell myself this. It creates a force than being natural. I guess forcing is like going against your will but having a natural mentality is what I'm lacking.	Akashh23_pop	post	15.412334070108441	female	White	0.9989156723022461	na	na	na	3	socialanxiety

Honestly with sad we’re so behind on interaction in that sense, like because we’ve had a lot less dating experience everything feels so INTENSE. Attraction is so normal, I can remember I had a few first experiences and I really thought I was in love and they were just flirting and playing and my intensity would often put a pin in things.

I bought $200 sun glasses from a sun glass shop. It was a very small shop with just 2 employees and myself chatting while I browsed. I gave in and chose a pair. I asked for a larger size because the one on the shelf squeezed my head too tight. The larger pair fit perfectly. I went on my way. The second I get in my car the glasses slide all the way down my nose due to my oily skin. The legs of the glasses are too long. I was LIVID.

"I entered my first year of college last year with social anxiety and I started off by sitting by myself at first. Then the professors grouped us up by last names and I was then put in a group of around 10-14 people. I take nursing so the majority of students tends to be girls while I was a guy. I saw this other guy that was Asian in my group just like me and I mustered up the courage to say “hello, my name is ‘___’” and he replies with his name and I asked him what culture he was from (or something along those lines). I was afraid of appearing rude or racist for bringing that question up so early. He tells me he’s Chinese and I said same and we both started talking in Chinese and such. We exchanged contacts then became good friends because we were both in the same courses and such.

I think I got lucky from this situation because he just so happens to have way more in common with me than I expected. But the main thing I tried to remember from this experience:

- pick out someone with similar thjngs to you, similar things that both of you can related with (Ex. being Asian, being male in a female dominated course, not seeming the greatest when it comes to popularity and such, looking introverted)

Sounds very cliche and weird here but- Trust that the social skills you’ve learned over your life is enough for you to get started with someone new. - Not only just believing, but knowing that both of you are on the same level, ex: as first year students with no one else in the class you know about, it is daunting, and so it’s as if you two should stick together as buddies.

"So I’m in line at Panda Express trying to get food. It was super busy. Normally I don’t have issues with ordering food, walking around the supermarket, etc…. I would say my SA is manageable to some degree.

But I was behind this old tatted up guy. His wife was very heavy and took forever trying to find her coupons on her phone.  Anyways, he kept standing there turning around seemingly checking me out or checking out the surroundings (do old tatted up guys normally do this?) Each time I would move up in the line, he would kept turning around, looking around.

It caused me to back up several steps, several times. I just wanted to say to him. Dude, can you just stand still and keep you F—-g eyes straight ahead. I have SA and you are making me hella uncomfortable. Has this ever happened to you?

And I imagine the reason you're playing it over and over in your mind is that you're trying to find the way to avoid it in the future. Once you have a strategy for that, say it out loud so you hear it. Say you've learned from your mistake. Say that you accept that you're upset, add that you will do better next time.

"I (20m) don't know what I want out of life. It seems that I can't commit to anything at all, and as a result, I sabotage every opportunity I come across. For the last two years, after graduating high school, I realized that I don't have any real plan for my life. I've just been working at shitty warehouse jobs for a few months at a time before quitting out of impulse.  
  
I came to the realization that my life was going nowhere last year, so I went to college for a semester, thinking if I change my environment, I'd somehow automatically become a driven and social person who knows what they want, which obviously didn't happen. I didn't go out of my way to socialize at all the whole semester, I felt so inferior to everyone in all of my classes and was terrified of embarrassing myself. And of course I had to follow my life pattern of half-assing everything and gave up on even showing up for class in the last month of the semester.  
  
I've been sitting idly by as my friendships and sense of identity from high school slowly fade away, and I've come to realize that I honestly have no idea who I am, no strong sense of identity at all. I don't have any real hobbies besides media consumption and video games, both of which I'm bored of, so I don't know what I like, and as a result I'm passionate about nothing. This didn't seem like such a problem in the past because I used to smoke weed every single day as a distraction to cope with the boredom, but I don't even enjoy weed anymore. Now that i'm staying sober, it forced me to come to terms with just how empty my life is.  
  
I feel like I haven’t really grown or changed in any significant way in the past 3 years. I’ve spent almost all of my free time just sitting at home, watching youtube, doom scrolling, wasting time. So I have barely taken any real risks and have just been staying in my comfort zone, which the longer you stay in, the harder it is to get out of. I feel like a husk of a person with no personality, social skills, or anything interesting going on at all. Whenever a co-worker would ask me what I did over the weekend, it was always embarrassing because I never did anything other than sit at home lol. Basically, I have very little real life experience which led to me having no real hobbies, strong interests, passions, or anything else that makes a person interesting. I’m a bore.  
  
  
I had a friend group from high school that I would consistently see until about two years ago, which is when we all started to drift apart. The only difference is that everyone in the group had other friend groups, and their own passions and hobbies, while i'm left alone with nothing. I bonded with my best friend over smoking weed and doing other unhealthy shit, and now that I don't want to smoke anymore, we basically have no reason to hang out, the last few times were pretty awkward cause I didn't have anything to say or do. I realize now that before I was just basically just mirroring his personality, so a lot of out friendship wasn't even with my true self.  
  
Anyway, this got way too long. Thanks for reading my ramblings about my shit life lol.

"My girlfriend was cheating on me with her main guy but she always tried to make me understand like she actually loved me so much and I am the only guy she talks to and also I don’t understand if she talked to me the so many times in a day how did she manage to give time to her main guy too and she always tried to prove her like she is doing whatever I want to manipulate to straight into she loves me and make me fall for her even more but from the beginning I had an idea like something was wrong and also my dots were starting to connect something inside me was telling me she was cheating but I didn’t want to be so mean and ignored this kind of thinking as this type of negetive thinking can only harm me.Anyways she had a meet with me 3 days ago and during meet she put her  cellphone in my pocket because she was not comfortable holding that thing (it’s a button phone of Nokia)and I had it in my pocket.So basically after meet she forgot to take her phone back from me and it was still in my pocket then.And when I came at remote distance from her home I found out her phone is with me At first I was thinking how can I return but at the second time I was thinking I should see if she talks with me or talks to someone else too and I found out that she talks with her main guy too(I just knew her main guy is her ex boyfriend and they don’t have connection anymore but actually they had).So she came to me to return her phone and she was a bit upset because I had to came all the way back to return her phone.And I asked her about her ex and if she talks with her ex boyfriend at first she refused and then she told me sometimes.But what I did was absolutely horrible I took all the numbers of her ex and her mom and dad and then her another number too and added those to my contacts.I contacted with her main guy and I came to knew they are still committed .I told him she was cheating on both of us and I didn’t want that to happen and I let him know everything,saw him our photos together and screenshot of texts(maybe can’t still believe).The next thing I saw she blocked me from Snapchat.

But they want you to be more of those go around the room ask how it's going kind of people. That's not me won't ever be me. Even if I do that it feels weird and awkward to me.

"(20f) Went out by myself Friday and was filled with anxiety. Every club I went into I just left immediately because I felt so awkward. I didn’t know what to do and I wanted to approach people but couldn’t. I then went to a different one and forced myself to approach these girls. It was awkward and I couldn’t do much talking. Tried going out to see if I can take someone home but I couldn’t, I couldn’t approach anyone and I seen everyone’s attention was always on the real party girls I honestly didn’t think I could stand a chance so I’d just leave and say forget it. I have low self confidence and self esteem. My only way to meet people is through technology and that’s my only way of doing things. Friends or even a guy. It’s easier for me, people say I’m attractive and I can honestly say I do pull some handsome men but I want to be able to just approach people and have conversations but I get so uncomfortable it makes me feel uneasy like it feels unreal in a way. I feel like if I approach a guy they’re going to think I’m ugly and don’t want to talk or with girls they just aren’t going to show interest and don’t want to be approached.  And when a guy does talk to me I feel like they’re stopping low and probably don’t really find me attractive but maybe because they have no other options.
Why can’t I just love myself? Enjoy my own company. Everyday I always feel like I want to be with someone or under someone but then I don’t want to? It feels like a battle. I feel like part of it is just me trying to escape from my home. 

I also want to add I was never the prettiest in school, I use to get bullied from Elementary school to high school and I’ve never had a boyfriend till last year. That’s more so where my low self esteem aims from and it’s just been with me till this day. Some days I have my moments I feel good then some days I don’t."

I wouldn't recommend going against the grain. If I were you, I would take your time with it. First, I'd visit clubs and just chill, looking around to form opinions about the place, people, or situation. If you do that enough, you might find something funny to share or something interesting. By doing this, you're going with the grain because you're familiarizing yourself first and coming up with something you can almost guarantee feedback or a positive reaction to—in other words, ensuring safety.

"I'm going into my JR year and 10th grade was the first year I actually went to HS since I was online from 7th-9th grade. Went to a priv school from KG-middle school and didn't keep touch with anyone so was pretty lonely during my online schooling. Was excited for school last year since I thought of it as a way to finally make friends but, I was to anxious to ever talk to anyone and was silent the majoraty of the year and would go weeks without speaking.

I'm so scared the same thing is going to happen all over again. I was uneasy everyday being there pretty much in a constant state of anxiety. Lunch was awful since I was uncomfortable being alone, group projects aswell + of course presentations.

I just don't want to do that all again. My anxiety is less bad i.e I can talk to teachers and when another student asks me a question I can answer but, I can't start conversations.

Hey everyone,So I'm about to grad with my Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity. I have just started my job search and have had a few phone interviews and make it past those but when it comes to the in person interviews I've been blowing them off. Not because I don't want the job, believe me, I want the job. But because my social anxiety is insane. For example, I actually did make it to one of the in person interviews this past week. I cried for about an hour before I had to be there, but I made it. Once there, I sweated what seemed like 5 gallons of sweat, couldn't speak for the first 5 minutes while everyone in the office stared at me. During the first few questions I stuttered like I had a speech impediment, and kept forgetting what they had just asked me. After about 10 minutes of this, I finally relaxed a little and the rest of the interview wasn't as awful. It was for a job I really want to get. The interview lasted about 45 minutes and by the end it seemed as if they really liked me and explained to me that they understand that interviews are tough and they themselves hadn't had to have one in over 25 years since they had all been there that long. They are supposed to let me know if they are moving forward with me or someone else this coming week.My question is, do you think they are just trying to be nice but are really thinking that I'm a mess? What should I do about my anxiety? It is out of control, and I am scared to death I'll never find a job or never pass an interview. Should I see a doctor? I really don't want to be medicated and have to explain why I can't pass a drug test because of the medication.

"Here are couple of tricks which I used to do until I got rid of anxiety:

**Preparation**. Google most asked interview questions for cybersecurity specialist. Then write your answers down on the paper. Then read it loud couple of times. Learn it. After that rehearse Q&A in front of the mirror. My gf used to make fun of me when I talk to myself in front of mirror. But, out of 10 interviews which I have attended during my life, I only got rejected 2 times. So 80% success rate. Is not bad.

**Warm up**. You can think of socialising as going into the gym. Before any heavy lifts such as squats, deadlifts is always good to do warm up sets. Usually interviews start around lunch time. So, what you need to do, is to go 2hours earlier. Then do not go into the office but walk around the city and just talk with random strangers. Ask for time. Ask for directions. Go to caffe, just talk with people. This will loosen not just your tongue physically, but also you will loosen up mentally. You sentences will be more fluid and you will be more relaxed.

**Exercise**. The idea is very simple. Usually if you are physically tired you care less what other people think about you. Your body wants to get rest. For example, if you are overweight initially you are afraid to go for jogging without being judged, however after one hour of running you are so tired that you literally do not give a damm about other people, you just want to go back home. So you can take advantage of this phenomena and just make yourself physically tired before interview, like go to gym in the morning."	hapa_hawaiian	reply	na	na	na	0.9984194040298462	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
See a doctor. They can prescribe some beta blockers that will slow down your heart rate. You can also by some stress beans from Amazon. I get this same exact way right before I have to get in front of class and teach a dance cardio class. I do this 2x a week and each and every time I go in full panic mode because of my SA.

"I am not diagnosed, so I will just say that I usually have a ton of anxiety during any social interactions, so I usually just stick to my two friends and avoid other people.

While attending the same classes offline my coding buddy used to be a girl my age who sat next to me, now the classes are online for over a year and we did not keep in contact, and I suffered without a coding buddy. I saw her today at a zoom lecture and it turns out we’re attending the same summerschool and I sent her a message in chat asking her to send me a text if she wants to chat.

I’ve been diagnosed with adjustment disorder, depression and anxiety due to tremendous bullying and death threats over the last year. It’s gotten so horrible to the point I’m afraid of people and cannot interact with anybody. I feel so unwanted because nobody cares to reach out to me and ask how im doing. It’s as if I don’t matter to anyone, im better off dead. I have the same routine everyday and im bored of it. Im unsatisfied with my physical appearance and despite working on it I still feel repulsive. If I was a lot more attractive I’m sure I wouldn’t be undergoing so much anxiety. I have constant brain fog and cannot initiate conversations or think of creative ideas. I feel useless cooped up in my house all day because I’m too fearful to go out. I dont have the balls to take my life yet because I still have a small amount of hope left and I don’t want my family to grief. They mean very much to me. I just feel like my life is wasted. I don’t have that many reasons to live. All the goals I’ve achieved in the past dont amount to anything, I haven’t done anything right since the beginning of this year. I’ve tried anti depressants, and therapy. Neither of them worked. Am I just at a low point of my life and will my anxiety go away soon?

"Back when I was in 12th standard, I got a call from a girl I had a crush on. For the past 10 months, I had only been texting her now and then, but I felt really strongly towards her. There was probably nothing I wanted more than to be in a relationship with her. 

But I was so anxious, that I did not pick up the call. And I didn't call back. I texted back. 

This was 10 years ago. (And I use the above as an obvious example, not the start of something)

Even today, I am afraid of phone calls, sometimes even if they are from people I know really well - like someone from home, or a very close friend, etc. 

I just can't stop my heart from beating faster when I get a phone call. 

I am naturally introverted but I am comfortable on a stage, with people in person, I guess? But phone calls would still give me anxiety like no other. (And if I do complete the call, I feel so happy)"	lostintime117	post	19.856576457848703	male	White	0.9947423934936523	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety

The fact is, no one holds any power over anyone! I've struggled with this for a long time and one day I just decided to go out and drian myself every chance I get. the more people I met the more I get used to people being both kind and sometimes somewhat disappointing. helps when you realize everyone a lot of the time is on autopilot (specially when it's random people you meet); so don't take a lot of things to heart!

"Uhh, where do I start...

I'm 28, diagnosed as atypical autism. I have a problem... I can't come to terms with myself. I'll just write here because I've been moping in bed for the past few days and writing this is better than nothing.

Let's start from the beginning. I was never that interested in hanging out in autism circles or otherwise be acknowledged about it since I got the diagnosis ca. 8 years ago. Or even before then. I was just a shy kid. There was always an underlying sense of hesitation, of fear and timidness, before knowing people. And I never got better. Never got any friendships I would feel are meaningful or rewarding. It simply isn't rewarding.

It was better in the times before puberty, since others just seemed to go along with what was happening.. but after, oh man, that was bad. Growing up to age 18 was pretty confusing, chaotic, and frustrating. I felt a light sense of uncomfortableness being myself in various situations, but I assumed it was because I haven't learned to be normal yet. At least, that's what I was told by various adults around me.

Sorry, I don't know much about the autism-specific terms, but I believe ""masking"" would be the right term. Hard-core masking. Day in and day out pretending to be normal, if awkward, person, trying to interact with others and failing, and always hitting that brick wall before getting to know someone. I wanted to be normal, but I never dared to truly relax, sit back, and let things just happen. There was always that feeling of uncomfortableness, of irrelevancy, of insecurity. It's difficult to describe. It feels like anxiety itself had a solid grip around my neck, guiding my every choice when out in public and making me suffer.

To the outside world, I probably just looked awkward. I came up with strange excuses for my behavior, but tried to ""correct"" myself as often and as much as I could to act normal. I always made way for other people and never learned the opposite way. Now when I look back on it, I can tell that the environment was pretty bad to begin with. I lived in a country then that does not promote or welcome people who are different. I mean, any society has this sort of attitude, but it's well known for being cold and unfriendly. It also didn't help that a family member died when I was just about 10 years, fucking up the only family I had in this country forever. Dad was a bitch who just left. Mom couldn't deal with my problems. Sister did her own things.

Anyways, I stood by myself. I went to college and didn't finish it because I have such an incredible amount of disgust towards the education system. I don't understand why it has to have the value it has in today's society, but whatever, I finished most of my classes, anyways. Not to mention work, a constant source of anxiety over the past ten years. I feel really upset when I think about working in the same kind of hierarchial structure, of working together with others who probably don't want the best for me. I feel so incredibly bad, depressed, and hopeless when I think about it.

And it's not like I don't want to work. I can work. I have worked. I learned many skills on my own without any guidance; such as pre-print, programming, artistry, design, 3d printing, the list goes on... I'm not stupid. I can analyze information and learn things from it without problems. But it's the structure of society, of the social stuff, that really fucks me up. You know, I even try to run my own game development company today, because it's kind of the only thing I can see myself working on for the future without feeling like I'm expendable garbage.

And then it's this autism thing. This hesitation I mentioned of getting to know people. The deeply rooted uncomfortableness that makes me feel like straight up shit. I can't control it and I can't reason about it. I've tried asking for help from public healthcare of course, but get the same old dismissing attitude: ""wow you are skilled! you should be able to work, just try it!"". I'm ""High functioning"" (as quoted by the original medical team who gave me the diagnosis), and yes, I can shower, make food, take care of myself, read instructions and do them, think rationally and logically. I know how to do this. But not the social, one of the biggest thing autistic people need help with. I'm just dismissed.

I have no one. I don't know anyone who is on the same page as me. I don't know anyone who could accomodate my behavior instead of me (well, except my wonderful girlfriend, who basically saved my sanity and life). I don't know how to deal with this. I've philosophized and thought about these thing of things for a long time. As in, what am I expected of, really? What should I give and what should I get in return? What is just in the exchange between me and society? What can I reasonable ask from people while still have a crumb of sanity left in my head? How do I play my role among everyone else and still feel okay to continue?

What do I really want? I just want to feel like that hesitation goes away. Drugs exist, I know. I've tried anti-anxiety medicine. I've tried other less legal substances. I've tried meditating. I've tried reading philosophy. I've tried many things to try and control myself before I go out to deal with people. Because dealing with people is too much. It feels sharp, hostile, like a threat. It feels terrible. For example... I can see the awkward social interactions everyone does, that they have to do because it's the norm. I can see how people struggle to be genuine with their feelings or intentions. I can perceive, sense and think about these things. I'm not stupid. But it makes me very depressed and alone.

I don't know how to convey this feeling more accurately. I feel like I'm irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, forced to become a cog like everyone else. Forced to participate in a society I never accepted the terms and conditions to. I've thought about exiting life, but I don't accept it. I don't want to cease existing and miss on any chance I could ever have to live here. But it's so incredibly frustrating to have these mental problems in the way for over ten years.

I can't tell if I'll ever solve it and get comfortable around strangers or people again. It might be traumatized for being exposed to my own made up fears and assumptions over the years. Maybe it's irreversible. I know in real life most people are positive, they have good intentions and don't want to hurt, but it's the matter of how the words and actions gets lost in the muddiness of real life. It's the framework, the hierarchy, the classes, the underlying structure of everything that fucks it all up.

And today I woke up and felt mentally exhausted. I couldn't work on my game and instead I have to worry about how to survive and to ""pull myself up by the bootstraps"". Make my own way because nobody else can fucking help me with this. It's tiring. I just needed to write this down. That's all."	transakonto	post	22.021050137442927	female	White	0.9920028448104858	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety

Happened again in 12th grade during another presentation, only this time I had to use a mouse and the cursor shook because my hand did.

My first panic attack. Standing in a crowded school corridor at 14. Alone, waiting for my teacher to arrive as she was making me resit a test by myself. The boy ( my crush) I was talking to online was a couple of metres away and I could feel his eyes on me. There were groups of other school kids talking loudly, I thought they must all be staring and laughing at me. He must have been judging my appearance and regretting talking to me. I felt like I couldn't breathe and I just knew I had to get out. I told myself I'd wait till fifteen minutes had passed and then I'd leave so my teacher didn't think I'd ditched the test. Thank god she turned up, or I would have bolted out there and then had to walk home alone in a state. I don't know how I managed to pass that test after all of that. I feel sad looking back now. I had no idea what was happening to me, even my diagnosed friend at the time said it sounded like a panic attack but I didn't truly believe her.

"I was 4 or 5 years old.

Parents & me were in a restaurant, it was outside. We ate, and then it was time for dessert. Parents asked me ""you want ice cream?"" and I ofc said yes.

They went thru their wallet, gave me some coins and said ""get what you want"". It was an outside ice cream bar thing (idk the name for this, it belonged to the outside part of the restaurant tho) 

I looked over and thought *""I have to speak to this stranger if I want to eat ice cream? Fck the icecream then, aint going over there.""* and gave the coins back to my parents. They were like *""oh, so then no ice cream, ok""*

From that moment on, I avoided almost everything. If it involved talking to people who are not friends/family, I avoided it. And theres no money or other rewards in this world that can change my mind and make me do these things.

5th grade I remember feeling like I never have before(I now know it was bad anxiety/an anxiety attack). The atmosphere at school had been changing as the years went by, I didn’t like it and rejected it but by now my classmates were firmly acting different, it wasn’t so simple and harmonious, they were forming little groups/cliques and were interested in self promotion and impressing people. I had been a target of bullies for a few years, had my teeth kicked in, my head body checked into the concrete wall playing soccer and a classmate threaten to shoot me. I just wanted things to continue being simple, fun and peaceful and suddenly things didn’t feel friendly anymore. Then I was pulled from that school and put into another religious one that I felt was being shoved down my throat too much so I rejected that. It’s taken me decades to learn about myself and teach myself a lot of the things I feel like I didn’t learn growing up. I still struggle a ton but I’m making noticeable improvements too.

"It's been about 5 years since my long-term-relationship ended and even before that I never really went on a date. We met in school and just kinda hit it off from there. 

Been working on myself really hard for the past eight months... I quit tobacco, alcohol and started exercising regularly. I even join my coworkers in the breakroom once or twice a week and try to engage in small talk with them. Overall I feel like I'm doing better than ever, except that I live in pretty much absolute solitude and don't have any social life outside of work/family. I try doing things my instincts tell me to avoid at every opportunity and I feel myself growing exponentionally every time I overcome something that I'd normally avoid.

I made a profile on Hinge about a month ago, got a few matches and then panicked of the thought of actually having to meet someone irl so I deleted the app. Now I've installed it again, but hidden my profile. I'm not sure if I'm actually ready to start seeing people. I'm a 28 year old male and feel like an autistic 14 year old when it comes to socializing. I can't help but fantasize about having a family of my own in the future and fixing the things that were done wrong with me, but I'm still a mess and scared of taking on too much and the backlash that might follow.

Dating apps give me debilitating panic attacks. Even if messaging is going fine and the people seem nice, respectful, attractive, etc, as soon as we start planning a date I'm completely paralyzed. I only managed one date over the course of two years trying (although I cried a lot before they got to my place, was on xanax the whole time, and ghosted them after it was over despite the fact it wasn't a bad date lol). So I deleted all those apps for a while because it just wasn't worth the anxiety. Then about three months later I met someone at a concert that I went to alone and I immediately felt Safe around them. We've been together almost a year now and they make me feel so at peace just by being in the room. Looking back, I think the pressure that dating apps put on me to flirt and try for a relationship made it so much harder ot even start. When I met my current partner there was no unspoken expectation of attraction or affection or any kind of future together, and I think that's part of what felt safe about it. I'm not saying dating apps can't or won't work, but you definitely don't need them to find someone compatible with you if they scare you more than they help you. And there's absolutely no rush or timeline to follow if you're not ready.	Possible-Nebula-947	reply	na	na	na	0.0025422063190490007	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"For me, I used alcohol as medicine. Two or three beers and the anxiety is gone, you can even drink them before the date. Sometimes I go an hour earlier, go to a bar across the street just to have a beer or two to calm down. Thats how I handled it, and we've been together now for about 8 years and got married this year.

If you can't beat the anxiety, just cheat. I use all kinds of medication/drugs to get through this life. If that means I'm still here tomorrow, who cares."	Possible-Nebula-947	reply	na	na	na	0.0025422063190490007	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
Yeah I completely understand, it's a tricky one. I get anxiety before speaking up with a random person or a person I would know so the thought of actually approaching the opposite sex with the intent of dating is even more worrysome. I want to start approaching random women time to time but it is really nerve wracking to say the least lol. I got better over the years to speak my mind despite anxiety but this challenge is a whole new beast for me. I managed to approach a girl first time in my life this year, but to try again atleast for the time being feels like a massive challenge. I talk quite a bit but even nowadays I dont say things to people I want or hesitate and then speak up, so u would probably imagine how hard it is to do such a thing. I'm not even sure what to suggest for u, because my ego tells me I'm being a pussy myself but this is like ur whole life u jumped in swimming pools from 2 meters above and now all of a sudden ur expecting urself to jump from 100 meters above. I believe u should work up towords that 100 meters. So lets say u r really shy right, instead of expecting urself to be able to talk with anyone, start with talking with ur family and cousins. Start talking a little more. So the same principle with anything, u basically work ur way up until u can do more than u could before. It is like a video game, if ur level 10, dont expect to be able to win a 100 level boss fight because ur not quite there yet. I'm not sure, maybe Im just justifying myself why I dont date currently but it seems to me this is the only way forward. I hope this ted talk had any use for u or anyone. This probably could have been summed up in a shorter text lol.	Possible-Nebula-947	reply	na	na	na	0.0025422063190490007	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"First of all, congratulations on the incredible personal growth you've achieved so far. Quitting tobacco and alcohol, exercising, and engaging with coworkers are massive steps, and it's inspiring to see your dedication to self-improvement.  
  
Dating, especially when dealing with SAD, is a deeply personal and often frightening step. But please know that your feelings are valid and you're not alone in this. It's okay to feel like you're a 14-year-old when it comes to socializing; many adults feel that way, particularly when stepping back into the dating world after a long absence.  
  
It might be helpful to start slow and set small, achievable goals. Instead of jumping straight into dating, maybe join some local groups or online forums that align with your interests. This could provide a low-pressure way to meet new people and build confidence in social settings.  
  
If you feel a longing for a relationship and family, those are beautiful goals to have. It's clear that you're thoughtful and considerate about your own needs and those of potential partners. That said, it's okay to seek professional guidance like therapy, where a professional can help you navigate these feelings and create a tailored plan for easing into dating.  
  
Remember, there's no ""right"" timeline for these things. Your journey is yours alone, and it's okay to take as much time as you need to feel comfortable and ready. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family, and don't be too hard on yourself. You're doing incredibly well, and your awareness and thoughtfulness are qualities that will surely be appreciated by others when you do decide to date.

I don't like self-promotion, but in this case, I can suggest you check my book ""Dancing with the Beast."" It provides tools and insights that might resonate with your journey [here](https://www.alistairmcleod.com/books/dancing-with-the-beast/).

"Hey, I'm not sure if it's sa or ocd. But I learned something to help myself with negative thinking. If there's a thought that's causing me stress instead of forcing myself to think the opposite, the negative thought can be stretched to just a little bit more positive, and that will give relief.

""Everyone will be watching me"" 
Stretch = ""Most people will be watching"" 
Stretch more = ""Some people might be watching me, but not everyone will have the same judgmental thoughts bc all people are different with different thoughts""

But obviously that doesn't stop me from looking nervous and being shy.

I literally can't control it. I've always had it for my whole life. It's part of who I am. No amount of ""exposure therapy"" has changed it. No amount of drugs or alcohol truly helps it.

Therapist here. In therapy, we explore the differences between mental health conditions (ex. social anxiety) and personality traits (ex. shyness, introversion). Though shyness, introversion, and social anxiety are nothing to be ashamed of, you should first check in with yourself and ask why you feel a need to share that info. It sounds like you're looking to explain or justify your quiet behaviour, and our mental health is only one layer of that. How we show up depends on the situation, the context, the people we're around, and how safe we feel to express ourselves. Therefore, citing social anxiety as a reason for quietness might not do your circumstance justice and might reduce your character to one trait-- one that changes based on the situation and conditions we're in! :)	hsisnsjs	reply	na	na	na	0.9944483041763306	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

It's completely natural to feel unsure about disclosing something as personal as social anxiety. The decision to share really depends on the situation and your comfort level with the person you're talking to. If it's someone you trust and feel close to, opening up about your social anxiety might deepen the connection and understanding between you two. However, if it's a casual acquaintance or someone you don't feel entirely comfortable with, a simple response like 'I'm just more of a listener' might feel more appropriate. Trust your instincts, and remember, you're never obligated to share more than you're comfortable with.

Social anxiety is very misunderstood and it is often confused for personality traits such as nervousness, shyness, and introversion. Feeling unsafe with others doesn’t inherently indicate the presence of social anxiety, so respectfully, social anxiety is more nuanced than how safe we feel.

"Vulnerability and opening up takes practice. If someone said to you “I’m quiet in certain situations and it takes time for me to get to know people,” it doesn’t make them weak, it makes them human.

These terms are often used interchangably by some people. My understanding is that introversion is a personality trait, whereas shyness and social anxiety are both an irrational fear, but with different level of severity. So SA is a severe form of shyness/shyness is a mild form of SA. Is that correct?	elektricar_	post	36.18912661293233	male	White	0.013719023205339909	na	na	na	3	socialanxiety

"introversion is a different thing! introverts enjoy being alone and ""recharge"" by spending time in isolation. they're happy with their own company. :)

i'm actually an extrovert with social anxiety. i \*want\* to be around other people; i \*want\* to have lots of friendships and social interactions, but i have frequent panic attacks before and after talking to other people. before social events, i obsess over my appearance, personal hygiene, posture, and other stupid ""appearance""-based things (because they feel like the only things i'm able to control before a social situation--i can't predict what the conversations will be), and then afterwards, i feel sick over all of the things that i've said and done ""wrong."" i'm pathologically terrified of other people disliking me and of being rude, annoying, or gross.

""shy"" is a word used to informally describe people who are afraid of talking to other people, for whatever reason. someone who's shy might be diagnosed with social anxiety, or they might have a different reason for not wanting to be super social. being ""shy"" is also usually associated with children who are hesitant about playing with or talking to their peers. ie. they might not have social anxiety; they might just be nervous about being separated from their parents, be scared of bullies, etc."	elektricar_	reply	na	na	na	0.013719023205339909	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

I see another commenter talking about cognitive behavioural therapy, currently I’m waiting 3 months for a spot to open up in the public care. The wait time is quite a long and I gotta head back to college in the fall so that really wasn’t an ideal option.

"My love life is hopeless and it recently just hit me that this might just be the way things will be for the rest of my life. I was always able to tell myself things like “that girl liked you at one point” you know to convince myself that I’ll change and maybe not fuck things up the next time.

The problem is I have so much anxiety with dating apps that it really does feel hopeless. I try it for a few days, get ghosted a few times and then give up. It feels like just getting a date is impossible now where it wasn’t before. It just destroys my ego. 

My first therapist (who I hated btw) would tell me that many of his clients don’t mind being alone. It always struck me as odd and like he had already given up on me. I’m not okay with being alone and I really don’t think I ever will be. This was back when I had no job with little prospects and no friends. I have a career and friends now and had always assumed that the dating part would just click at this point.

It kind of feels like this forgotten mental health issue in my opinion.. with that being said, I hope u can take some of the blame off yourself.

I still use it, I just don’t use it as much and get my fyp to be less harmful. I use it for entertainment, even though it doesn’t work to entertain me for more than two hours most of the time.

I prefer YouTube heavily with video content, it gives me more valuable information and more control over what I watch. I rarely ever comment, though. I’m probably most active comment-wise on Reddit."	kjwhimsical-91	reply	na	na	na	0.9969452023506165	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

This has to be my mind playing with me and making me feel down but no matter how many groups I hang with there’s always these moments where I feel like nobody  talks to me or I feel alone while everyone else is deep in conversation. Everybody I met in life seems to have their favourite person and I honestly  feel like I’m nobody’s. I just find myself the person who nobody wants to talk to and it makes me honestly feel like I have the worst personality in the world and recently I’ve just been questioning myself a lot.

And I kind of feel this strong sense of isolation and jealousy that I just have to fight off this urge to just start crying because I hate that it’s so hard for me to be like that. I often feel so out of place. And then I get more anxious and self-loathing because I don’t want to make a scene and I just have to breathe through it to not start crying.

Any advice/reassurance for this sort of thing?

"Hi, I just got diagnosed with SAD a couple days ago.  
One thing I'm wondering about is the fact that I find structured social events to be easier than unstructured ones. By which I mean: something like a team lunch or a dinner party is super stressful for me; I never know what to say or how to engage with people and worry that I'm being super awkward. But something more structured like playing board games or seeing a movie or a team-building exercise like a scavenger hunt is a lot easier, because I can focus on the task and I feel like it's not as noticeable that I have trouble with general conversation. In fact I kind that opportunity to interact with people in a way that feels safer/lower-pressure.  
Is that a typical thing with SAD? Or does it maybe indicate that I have some other kind of communication disorder underneath? (e.g., I have considered I might be on the autism spectrum due to some other details as well, but my psychiatrist said I should try to manage my anxiety itself first before exploring that deeper.)"

Yes, I find the same, that doing activities is better. Things not focused on conversation/ eye contact. These things are naturally going to feel a bit less stressful since there is less pressure to constantly interact.	Chickadove	reply	na	na	na	0.013602213002741337	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
I also find structured events easier because you know what you're getting into. You can mentally prepare for the event beforehand at least to some extent, which you can't in the case of a unstructured event. You never know what conversations will be had at a dinner party for example, but if you got to a movie, youll likely be discussing the movie.

Social anxiety has both biological and psychological components. While it may be true that some of it can't go away through psychotherapy alone, it's possible to improve at least a bit. My SA also worsened a lot through the pandemic, but one of my old friends reached out to me and got me out of my shell, and for the first time in like 2 years I felt normal (at least when I was with them).

(from personal experiences of being given non-medicine help, my problem is i feel like im frozen. no matter what, its like i cant make the effort to do something different or take small steps to try to become more comfortable with myself. like trying to calm down before ordering food, or attempting to talk to someone without my voice getting quiet and high pitched. the discomfort comes so fast and it feels like i have no control, and that kills my motivation yet deep down inside i really do wish i didnt have to live like that anymore.) that aside, i hope you can find something that will help you, even if its only a little. stay strong 🙂💪	meydan_larousse	reply	na	na	na	0.008057661354541779	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

I said that it's like being forced to act in a play where you don't fully understand the plot and no one gave you the script but you're still expected to know what's going on and perform accordingly.

"I’d also add: if you make a mistake with your lines or acting(offend someone, say something dumb or weird, responding with an inappropriate reaction), people will throw tomatoes at you for poor performances (criticize, judge, dislike). Or at least that’s what someone with SAD will think. When in reality, some people might not even notice, or even care to throw a tomato, but still some might whether it’s justified or not. But we’ll never know.

Sure they may throw flowers (compliment, relate, laugh, be attracted) to you for good performances too, but the idea that someone has the chance to throw a tomato at you gives debilitating anxiety and so much dread, to the point it’s safer that you don’t participate to avoid as much of the tomato throwing as possible.

Personally I wouldn’t say the play is always difficult to understand or that the script isn’t present. It could be in some cases, but I’ve been through enough interactions to at least repeat what has worked in the past, like an algorithm, but in the end, the play tends to be lacklustre with the amount of npc responses given.

But I still want to be a part of the play, despite having such an intense fear for tomatoes. I think a lot of people do too, but it’s just because of the tomatoes that we feel it’s gonna be too energy draining to try to say the right lines and act properly while in our fight/flight mode."	samathee1218	reply	na	na	na	0.029865415766835213	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

I had this happen to me twice. I gave my number the first time but realistically would not have known who was calling or probably gone out. The other I blurted 'No, thank you.'

But to answer your question, I have done it twice. I am a girl though, but I also like girls.

Both were in the same situation (Daily commute), and both were a couple of weeks of a polite smile and recognition before I approached her.

Yes, you will fail often with cold approach unless you're just that clever, good looking, or both but not doing it at all will mean less opportunities. As long as you do it respectfully you should definitely try to get out of your comfort zone. Don't listen to these people lol. Try to look for signs if the woman might be interested.

"here's my take on cold approach. if you have to cold approach, most likely, you got underlying problems. all the guys i know who do cold approach either come from a broken home, have depresion, anxiety, low self esteem, autism, or all of the above. so you've got all these mental illnesses, and that's why you cant meet people through normal chanels such as school, work, church, gym, etc. if you were a likable person, you woulda found someone through normal chanels. since youre either not likable, or have handicaps, you have no other choice other than doing cold approaches. but here's the thing, because you've got all these problems, you're fragile. you come off as wierd to women, and get rejected. instead of building up your confidence, your self esteem lowers from being rejected. in fact, it's normal to have low self esteem due to rejection. think about it. when youre accepted by your peers, your self esteem grows. naturally, rejection lowers our self esteem. if your self esteem doesnt lower as a result of rejection, then there's something wrong with you. this is why alot of men who do cold approaches end up retreating, and become isolated. there are some men who end up with the ""i don't care attitude"". you go up to women with an i dont care attitude and neither will the women you approach. guys who go around with a who cares attitude will usually alienate everyone around them. men who are good with people are usually very in tune with what others like and don't like. they will exhibit behaviors others like and therefore gain acceptance. with pick up artists, they seek to desensitize themselves in order to keep approaching random women, but what ends up hapening is they bcome detached, and disasociated with their surroundings. this obstructs their ability to relate to others which is essential to cold, and warm approach. because they don't care what anyone thinks, they never actually improve. not caring usually means they will never figure out what people like and dont like. they just want to throw out their pick up lines and move on. it's funny how pick up artists always say they want to improve themselves, but they're more likely to be stagnant than anything else, and are unlikely to be appealing even after years of doing pick up, ignorant of their own mistakes. because pick up is primarily a money making scheme. men with autism, depresion, etc are told they can get any girl they want if they apply some tactics while mostly ignoring their mental illnesses. either way, you're going home empty handed. now there are definitely men who have a who cares attitude who are married, or dating, but they are unlikely to have met their spouse through cold approach."	jamesthedean1	reply	na	na	na	0.9995005130767822	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"I agree. It’s great to get yourself out of your shell. But as a woman I’m gonna say this isn’t a good way to do it. Even if a man is great looking, charming, and social, most of us will be on edge. We’re approached by random men all the time and it often escalates to danger. We can’t tell who has good intentions and who doesn’t. So no matter how well you approach us we will probably be scared. Even if you get their number etc, it might be out of fear, not success. It’s setting yourself up for failure

Meeting in a group setting is definitely a better option. That way the women aren’t alone and feel safer. You’ll also know they’re open to meeting people because they’re there, as opposed to women going about their day in public. You’ll get more positive experiences with people with common interests and be more likely to meet someone you vibe with. The common interests give you something to talk about. Also just practice making conversation without any goal or expectation. Something might come naturally from that and it’ll build your skills for the future

If you do do weekly groups, it also gives you the benefit of them seeing you often, getting to know you, and possibly liking you more by exposure. And if not it’s still good experience"	jamesthedean1	reply	na	na	na	0.9995005130767822	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"Lol, I'll be the butthurt one to bite on this. Because to be frank, you also give no reason why cold approach IS weak sauce. 

Cold approach has changed my life for the better personally. It's made me a lot more confident and more comfortable with uncomfortable situations. Plus, it's also made it much easier to find women I'm compatible with. And I've made great friends from it too. 

It's probably 10 - 20x'd the amount of people I'd normally interact with... giving me way more chances to meet someone who I actually connect with well. 

And in my experience, as long as you're not extremely creepy about it, most women will appreciate the approach done well. Because the fact is, the vast majority of women are not actually being approached regularly. And many will say they never have.

Have some self-awareness and be straightforward... a simple ""Hey, I know this is a bit weird for me to randomly approach you... but I find you quite attractive and I would be upset with myself if I didn't at least come say hi"" will do.

Sure, some will just immediately reject and say no thanks, and you just move on. Others will immediately tell you how you just made their day and will be extremely receptive. Humans are human and will react all sorts of ways.

And then from there you find out if you actually have chemistry with the person. I don't see how any way is quicker and simpler than that.

I'm convinced people that talk down on cold approach either are too uncomfortable doing it themselves so just decide its easier to bring that group of people down, or their idea of cold approach is just some pick up guru walking around a park hitting on 20 girls an hour. 

There's nothing wrong with seeing someone you genuinely believe is attractive, and respectfully shooting your shot. You'll never see them again so you might as well."	jamesthedean1	reply	na	na	na	0.9995005130767822	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"right.. also OP's post read kind of sad to me.. Like why does it have to be with the hopes of getting a girl to date? Girls/Women are humans. Can't it be a good thing to just have a friendly conversation, without this goal in mind? (At least in my opinion I'd be immediately turned off if it shined through that was the intention of approaching, but then again... guys are weird.) And why do it ""consistently"" until you've achieved that goal? If the reasoning was ""I greet 10 people every day to better my social anxiety"" I could understand, but ""I'll approach 10 women every week until I get gf"", nah..

Also won't one just wind up being known as the ""creepy dude"" around the whole area?

ALSO also, it most likely won't be a good ""training"" to gain confidence, cause you're setting yourself up for failure. The reactions predictably won't be super positive ones, just based on the mere situation you're creating. Cause like many people here pointed out, 1. people are usually busy on their way somewhere, 2. women are approached constantly and most will be either very frightened, or annoyed, most will be uncomfortable.

(It's true, some of the best little social interactions can happen spontaneously, waiting next to someone for a bus or whatever. But thats the thing. It just happens and you can't force that. And these moments are precious in themselves (at least nowadays, where every bit of communication or even an acknowledgement or a little joke with a stranger is almost unthinkable, especially where I'm from), but they usually won't turn into relationships.)

OP. Imo you should ask yourself the question: Do you really want a relationship and why do you want one? What do you hope to gain from a partner at this stage in life?

Because we often fall into the trap of thinking we need something because ""that's how it's done"", but eventually, you realize it is not all it's made out to be or what *you* wanted or needed at that time after all. Especially not forcing something like this. (To me it kinda sounds like you want one for the sake of ""having a gf"". Might be the wrong impression but thats just based off the info given. But that aside..)

What do you think about making self-improvement the main goal for now? Could you also enjoy just simple friendships and interactions? Or try routes that are more promising of a successful outcome.

If I learned one thing with social anxiety, it is that any kind of ""training"" (or ""confronting your fear"") has to have a almost guaranteed positive outcome! Otherwise it'll just continue the cycle and reinforce your anxiety and carve these neural pathways even deeper in yo brain.

I mean it depends on the person how ""far along"" they are, but seeing as this is a social anxiety sub, I feel it is most important that these opportunities for getting out of comfort zone and improving have to be ones with good chances at positive feedback.

"At last. A rebuttal!

I respect this response. It’s well thought out and put together.

In this case I like how you used cold approach as a means to an end to help your self esteem with dealing with uncomfortable situations and that you discovered an outlet that helped with that.

I have no problem with that. More power to you.

What I _do_ have an issue with is the powerful PUA culture that preys on desperate men and has them aimlessly wander city streets for attractive looking women in the hopes that they’ll land a date. Now _that’s_ weak sauce.

A lot of these guys don’t see cold approach as a confidence boost, they see it as as numbers game to get women with the hopes of doing the complete bare minimum of effort imaginable thus, fuels the stigma.

Unfortunately that may lead to other parties being uncomfortable as well, due to him being nervous .

"Hello,

You could try writing a letter to your supervisor and let them know about how the  inappropriate comments make you feel uncomfortable and that you are letting them know of it so they can take action because you are trying to avoid that the harassment escalates to something else.

"I really think that I did my best to accommodate him and keep him company before the neighbor came to open the door. I tried to be as nice as possible and sympathetic and even offered them to sleep at my place, offer them food, offered them to use my phone, hell - I even offered them alcohol. They only accepted the latter two. I enjoyed his company. I was able to talk with him for hours. 

I really was nice to him. Now, he's talking with me after the fact. We talk about stuff we like, ideas, politics, morals, whatever. I enjoy it a lot. I still think that I'm in the wrong.

I feel like he's only doing this because he wants to pay me back. I don't feel that's fair. I feel I put him in a position where he'd have to ""pay the debt back"". I feel terrible whenever he has to interact with me because I really feel like I'm forcing him to put on a happy face and talk to me.

Is this a social anxiety thing? Is this a low self-esteem thing? Am I simply wrong in indulging with his company? Help me out please."	_Meisteri	post	27.01829399830986	female	White	0.9808667898178101	na	na	na	11	socialanxiety

"I haven’t talked to my online friend in months even though he’s messaged me a ton of memes and I feel awful. I posted about this another day on Reddit on a different sub but im incredibly avoidant and im trying to change. I get nervous that people are mad at me for not responding so I avoid it even more also I avoid it cause I don’t know what to say. I’m not sure if my response is good enough so I wanted to ask what other people might think. So how is this?

 “Hi, I’m sorry it’s been a long time since we talked and I want you to know that I’m not trying to ignore you or anything, it’s just that I’ve been struggling a lot with social anxiety stuff. How have you been lately?” 

I don’t know I think it sounds really bad. :/ I was like maybe I should just be honest but now I’m thinking it sounds to annoying and all about me but I want him to know it’s not personal that I haven’t responded. Ugh

Maybe I should just say like “hi, I’m sorry it’s been a long time since we’ve talked. I got a bit busy with things at work and with life. How have you been lately?” 

But I don’t know cause that seems kinda like I just didn’t care when I’m reality I’ve been anxious over this situation for months, and I definitely haven’t forgotten about him."	Yoshineedshelp	post	16.749683573490397	male	White	0.9990134239196777	na	na	na	12	socialanxiety

"The first option is the best. It sounds genuine (not strange or weird at all imo)! And you place yourself in a vulnerable position. If your friend has sympathy he will definitely understand your situation, and he might even give you some heads up/support that will boost your self-esteem for the upcoming days or weeks.

I wouldn't send the second option, because it sounds a bit too neutral/cold. It leaves more room for misinterpretation."	Yoshineedshelp	reply	na	na	na	0.9990134239196777	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety
Definitely try to be as honest as you're comfortable with.

"You're welcome. I've been the one to disappear, and I don't blame people for not wanting to be around that kind of consistency. Right now, I have a friend who'll disappear and I'll check in on her. Sometimes, it's hard when she doesn't get back to me, but at the end of the day I'm choosing to reach out and check in, and it's up to me to back off if I'm feeling like I'm not getting the same kind of energy back.

I think it's often useful to reframe this as, “What kind of message would I like?” And, I think most people would prefer some kind of acknowledgement of the situation (accountability) and simple honesty.

I'm glad you're talking again! The worst thing that could've happened is he would've ended the friendship, but then at least you could walk away with closure. Life is frail and brittle.

Hey there! You're definitely not alone in feeling that way. For some with social anxiety, talking on the phone can indeed feel more intimidating than speaking face-to-face. It might be because phone conversations lack visual cues, so we can't gauge the other person's reactions, body language, or expressions. Plus, the immediacy of a phone call leaves less time to think about what you're going to say next. What helps me is to remind myself that it's okay to take a moment to think, and that the person on the other end likely doesn't notice the pauses as much as I do. Also, practice can make it more comfortable over time. Hang in there! You're not alone in this.	SPMD90	reply	na	na	na	0.9978277087211609	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"I constantly feel sad and unwanted. I have never been confident nor so had any form of self esteem. I feel like you could erase me from any social situation going on in a room and it would not make a difference because I do not bring anything to the table and is just a waste of space. I don´t mean to be that way, so quiet, but my social anxiety shuts me off and my mind is constantly blank. I don´t mean to be reserved and standoffish. I wish that I was a social butterfly who was chill and relaxed but I´m not. My shield is so thick due to my anxiety that I am not my true weird and funny self.  
  
It is a constant feeling that I am not enough as I am when comparing interactions with another coworker that started at the same time as me. She is very relaxed and chill, and just says what is on her mind without overthinking. The opposite of me. When comparing us and how the staff is with both of us, it just feels like they like her more since they laugh and smile more. And why wouldn´t they? I´m just a blank boring wall. A waste of space that does not matter.  
  
I try to be friendly (I smile, hello, thank you) and I am very polite, but perhaps to the point of being formal and boring. Apart of it, or a rather large part of it is my social anxiety, but also because it is my dream job so I don´t want to mess it up. But I am anyway.. There is also a constant battle in me of ´´Did I give to much of myself so I am annoying people, do they think I´m self centred´´ and ´´I am so boring and quiet, I am giving nothing of myself at all´´. My self hatred is so deep and it is making me suicidal thinking about it. I´m never gonna stop feeling like this."

"You can absolutely change these things if you work at them! Confidence is BUILT by doing things that you fear. When you do enough things that build confidence, eventually you won't need validation from the outside world because YOU yourself know what you've done and what you're capable of.

A common vehicle for this process is going to the gym/fitness. You build confidence and discipline while simultaneously improving your health and looks.

Another approach I did to tackle my social anxiety was adding a habit tracker to improve socially wherever I was struggling. I'd try to make good eye contact with one person a day, and eventually eye contact became second nature for me.

I also realized that I had waaay too much anxious energy in my body that I was bringing around with me, and it was hindering my social interactions. I meditate daily and do a daily gratitude practice, they have made me much more relaxed and positive. 

When I have a ""full cup"", only then can I truly focus on others. I get genuinely curious about others when I'm not so caught up in myself.

"First don’t ever do comparisons. It will destroy you inside. That coworker doesn’t have SA so it would be like asking how come you with only one hand can’t do surgery as a 2 handed person. Accept you’re not holding a full deck of cards and comparing yourself to someone that is, isn’t fair to yourself. I used to see kids half my age go up on stage and teach group fitness classes with the most confidence ever. Yet I beat myself up because I’m double their age and shaking like a leaf up there. Than the self doubt and loathing started creeping in. Don’t do that, make comparisons.

If you’re able to see a doctor, maybe some anxiety meds will help ease some of your symptoms. Than the next step would try to come to a place of making effort to feeling uncomfortable and pushing against your own boundaries you’ve set within yourself. It can get better.

"Instead of viewing yourself as either a ""social butterfly"" or ""reserved and standoffish,"" recognize that social behavior exists on a spectrum. It's possible to find a balance between being outgoing and being more introverted.

Avoid assuming that negative experiences in some social situations apply to all social situations. Recognize that each interaction is unique and that people's perceptions can vary.

Make an effort to acknowledge positive aspects of your interactions. Focus on any moments where you felt comfortable, connected, or received positive feedback, rather than solely dwelling on negative aspects.

Understand that feelings are not always an accurate reflection of reality. Just because you feel sad, unwanted, or lacking in self-esteem does not mean that these feelings are an accurate representation of your worth or the reality of your social interactions.

Remember that people's reactions and behaviors are influenced by their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. It's not solely your responsibility to control how others perceive you or to assume blame for their reactions.

Recognize that social anxiety does not define your entire life or determine your ability to be happy. It's possible to manage and overcome social anxiety with the right support and strategies.

Give yourself credit for the efforts you make in social situations, such as smiling, saying hello, and being polite. These actions contribute to creating a positive social environment, even if you perceive them as formal or boring.

Avoid using harsh and negative labels to describe yourself. Recognize that you have unique qualities, interests, and potential for growth. Embrace your true self and allow yourself to express your personality in your own way."	EnergyCorrect	reply	na	na	na	0.99904865026474	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

 (I'm 15F, also mentions of self harm) So I go on walks every day, like a couple minutes, to a little river bridge thing and I then I come back. So there's one last house before a tiny path to the river, and in this house there are two dogs. I don't see these dogs every time I walk but when I do they are behind a little gate and they bark at me. Also I'm pretty sure this guy has a beware of dog sign. So anyway today I was walking to the house and the two like medium sized dogs ( I'm clueless on breeds, they were like    really short haired.) run up to me and start barking, like an idiot I panicked and started to scream and run away. Like a couple seconds later the owner walks out and calls the dogs to him. He tells me that you shouldn't run from dogs, but he's very nice and apologizes and says they're just excited the ,dogs didn't hurt me at all btw. I apologize too and basically speed walk back to my house. And once I got to my room I start crying , panicking and I cut/ scratch at my arms to relieve stress.I know this is stupid and no one is in the wrong but it's little stupid stuff I do that embarrass me that make me so self conscious and anxious. Of course I can always walk in the other direction, I know my life isn't over but I hate how small mistakes like this are so big to me . Sorry this is long but thanks for reading, I'm not great at talking to others so this is a good way to get my feelings out. Have a good one and don't run away from dogs.

"That was totally inappropriate to turn that on you as if it was your fault that you ran away. Most people will instinctively run even if they know better and some dogs will attack even if you hold still. Not running only works if the dog otherwise wouldn’t have bit but gets excited by the chase.

He needs to keep his dogs under control. I would report it to animal control. The phrase you need is “charged and menaced” not attacked.

Also get an airhorn. They are cheap and the noise is unbearable for dogs. We use them at the shelter when there is an attack."	Tiny-Birthday2923	reply	na	na	na	0.0727224200963974	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

He said it was friendly but it was still rlly scary for a few seconds there because from my POV I could only see the dog and not the owner.

Hello so to start I do not go to very many social events EVER. I just moved schools and only have like 3 friends and I’m not a very social person. I don’t know if I should force myself to go to a football game tonight because everyone is going- but the problem is I just don’t feel up to it. This is where I’m stuck because I NEVER feel up to it so when is it going to stop? A couple of my friends are going I’m just so anxious about finding them, getting there, paying by myself etc. (yes I have social anxiety). I really just want to stay home and do nothing but I don’t want to miss out because I’ve a been feeling like I’m wasting my teenage years. So should I suck it up and go, or just stay home and watch everyone’s instagram stories about it.	Familiar_Sir8937	post	21.62854462895099	female	White	0.998145580291748	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety
"Option 1: Decide to go, and make going there your only standard of success. No matter how it goes, you decided to do something hard and followed through. That’s a success of your own making. Plenty of people don’t enjoy that kind of thing, so it’s fine just to try it out.

Then make bonus goals that may not work out but would feel good if they did:
- for example, tell a friend you’re nervous and ask for support. Decide you’ll leave by half-time if you’re miserable. Imagine specifically how going might be enjoyable, and look for those opportunities - doing origami and listening to your friends chat? Watching the game from the top of the bleachers and eating comfort food? If there’s really not any part of the night that would be enjoyable, consider option 2:

Make plans for something you enjoy at home. Just because you’re doing something different than the Insta-stream doesn’t mean you’re wasting your time. Maybe you could ask a friend over to work on a hobby, or arrange to watch an old favorite with someone in your family, complete with banana splits. Watch the stars come out with some hot cocoa.

I know the feeling. I guess that for a start, as you are not really used to go to such places, you can start small, going to a less crowded place with your close friends, then hopefully, after getting more used to these enviroments, you can feel less anxious about going to these big events. The fear of missing out on life is real, but dont force yourself all of a sudden, it works for some people but for others it ends up being traumatic, and might make you refrain from triying to go out in the future. My tip is: baby steps and you'll get there.	Familiar_Sir8937	reply	na	na	na	0.998145580291748	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety

I feel awkward sat there in silence and don’t want to come across as rude to the hairdresser but sometimes it’s just so hard to know what to say to help the time go by…it’s such a minor thing I know but to me it’s a huge anxious situation to go through.

"I know it sounds odd but I was a hairdresser for 8 years with social anxiety. 😂 I finally quit the job because I was on the verge of burnout. (In some ways it helped me to deal with my anxiety but it was extremely exhausting to do)

What I can tell you is if you feel uncomfortable talking, just bring either your phone, e-reader or a magazine. Explain what you want with your hair ofc and tell the hairdresser that this is finally the time you can catch up with some reading and relaxing time. If you have the same hairdresser every time, the next time you come in you don't even have to tell them that anymore as the hairdresser understands you are not the type who wants to have a therapy or gossip session in the salon. I have had many customers who didn't want to chat and just needed some ""zen"" time. There is no shame in that and if you have a good hairdresser, she or he will respect that."	laraandellie	reply	na	na	na	0.9936216473579407	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"Something that helps me that might work for others when they’re out in public.I’d like a therapist’s take if possible. Putting on a persona. For me when I’m at work I wear the persona of the gentleman. While I’m still quiet when I do interact with people I can get through the interaction relatively painlessly. I’ve never been a theater kid but learning to act like a gentleman in those contexts help.

In the store just doing my deal it’s speed. In and out don’t dither or dawdle. Get what you came for and leave. If you’re there 20 minutes you failed.

When I do my thing in the army reserves I act like a soldier or at least what I think a soldier should act like.

Problem with personas is I can only keep them up for a limited time before the scared anxious me comes out. 3 days tops."	Glum-Square3500	post	28.14931413161119	male	White	0.004642736166715622	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety
"I tend to put on somewhat of a persona while working at an ice cream shop. One that is superficially positive because generally people are positive when they are getting ice cream.

I say superficial as in, I care about other people’s life and they don’t care about mine, I’m just there to put on a positive attitude and serve ice cream.

But that in my opinion is masking. In the sense that I am putting something im not out on display. Now im not sure that this is a bad thing yet for me because on one hand, I get more tired, but on the other hand, I appear positive and likeable. 

I save my true self for myself, closest friends and family, but this persons is usually what customers will know me by. 

Lately I have been trying to integrate a bit of some desire of knowing other people into my positive persona: asking where someone’s from, whether it is their first time in town, what ice cream flavour do they like and maybe we could pick something from our selection that best suit their taste. Starting off little by little like this to give more depth to that persona seems to be heading in a right direction I believe and I’ll continue to try."

I am female and slightly overweight. While I am far from obese and am not even really fat by American standards, my flabbiness has always been a source of shame for me. To combat this, I have tried many times over the years to start going to the gym. However, I’ve found myself too anxious and self-conscious to do anything except for the small handful of exercises I am confident in my ability to do. This has led to gaps in my training, ultimately really stunting my progress. I am scared to run on the treadmill faster than a jog because I’m afraid of others hearing me breathing heavy. I can’t bring myself to even touch a barbell, even though I know I can easily squat more than the weight of the bar. My anxiety has honestly really made the gym a place of constant stress. Does anyone have any advice on how to overcome this?	Sensitive_Tune3301	post	26.349454213804457	female	White	0.9987205266952515	na	na	na	4	socialanxiety
"I felt like that too in the beginning! Im now going for a year and the anxiety is much better and the gym has become one of my biggest hobbies. 

What helped me was going at times when the gym is very empty. I also realised that almost everyone is using headphones, so nobody even hears you breathing. If I didn't know how a machine works, I would try to find the name of the brand, google the specific machine and watch a video about how that specific machine work. Also don't put pressure on yourself. If you don't want to be there, just go home and try again another day:)"	Sensitive_Tune3301	reply	na	na	na	0.9987205266952515	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
Just wear headphones and avoid eye contact with people. Your health is more important than what your perception of what other people think about you is.. which I can tell you probably isn't much at all. People go to the gym to do their own thing.

"I know how you feel and can really relate. I was so obsessed with what other people in the gym may or may not think about me….it was exhausting.
I finally learned over time that pretty much everyone in the gym, regardless of their level of fitness, is in their own head and often comparing themselves to the fittest person in the gym. The truth is that no one  cares about the “normal” people like us. When I see an “overweight” person working out, my first thought is usually something more like “yes! Kick some ass!”.  And then I go back to my workout. It’s all a head game and  I promise you that most of the people in that gym are too focused on themselves to worry about anyone else.

"Exposure seems great if you are someone who constantly avoids things out of fear. The problem is, there isn't much I avoid, even if there is a lot I fear. Going to the store is torturous for me. But I do it multiple times a week because I have to. It hasn't really become any less anxiety inducing to me. I leave the house practically every day, yet I'm still ridiculously uncomfortable just walking down the street, no matter how much I try to encourage and assure myself I'm doing fine. 

I see creating a hierarchy of fears recommended quite a lot. Stuff I regularly have to do, I'd put pretty high up in that hierarchy. But I haven't gotten any more comfortable.

It's recommended that you should be taking baby steps in controlled and positive situations. But life dictates I have to be constantly taking big steps in uncontrolled and scary situations. Whether that's school or work or buying groceries. 

I don't totally get how to practice exposure? Like does going to work not count as exposure? What's the difference between going for a walk and going for a walk for the purpose of practicing exposure? 

Say I go and order a coffee. What would I be doing to make that experience count as exposure therapy?"	DaftGuard7	post	21.720927181259356	female	White	0.9975630044937134	na	na	na	3	socialanxiety
"The key difference is if it’s exposure done voluntarily or involuntarily. If there’s outside pressures making you do things that inside you can feel yourself resisting and not wanting to do, it’s effect will be limited. You might become more desensitized if you do these things enough times, but fundamentally you’ll still be afraid.

Also, there’s multiple levels of avoidance. You may not be avoiding the outer situation, but you’re probably avoiding the feelings that come to surface in these situations. 

If you can, try to go into these situations voluntarily and try to allow what you’re feeling. Don’t run from it or fight it because that just fuels it. Feel it more and try to make peace with it. And that’s how it will pass."	DaftGuard7	reply	na	na	na	0.9975630044937134	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"I was sitting at a table with some family members I hadn't seen in a long time, with a cake on the table.
I wanted to take a piece of the cake, but each time I attempted to pick up the knife to cut myself a slice, I would stop myself because of everybody looking at me, idk I was afraid they'd judge me for taking a piece of the cake or say something about it like ""getting yourself a slice, huh ?"" or something stupid, the kind of remarks to which I don't know how to respond to. 

Anyway, I finally decided to do it, after all, it's a piece of cake, how woukd getting myself a piece of cake annoy anyone ? So I cut it, and tried to put it on my plate, but because of all the cups and other stuff on the table, which was very small, I struggled with getting that stupid piece of cake onto my plate. It took maybe 20 seconds before I got it, but of COURSE, there had to be someone who HAD to say one of those remarks, like ""c'mon, you can do it !"", which made everybody stare at what I was doing, making me super uncomfortable.

I ended up getting that stupid slice of cake onto my dumb plate, but as I felt that I just couldn't take it anymore, and was gonna end up in tears because of a panic attack, I immediately ran away from the living room, hid in a corner to calm down, and started writing this post.

Like WTF ? I can't even cut myself a piece of cake without it ending in a panic attack ! I worried it would end like this, convinced myself nothing would go wrong, and it fucking happened anyway ! I can't stand this constant feeling of uneasiness whenever I'm with people, no matter who they are ! There's no way for me to get better if everything I do just ends in me running away and tearing up !

you said you do not know what do to when someone makes a “funny” remark about your behavior and the truth is you don’t actually have to do anything, just laugh and continue doing whatever you are doing, this will make you look charming and a calm person, which is a great thing, and the person who tried to be funny will just feel ignored because you weren’t affected by what they were saying	HeyHoCharlie	reply	na	na	na	0.9992807507514954	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"Hey man, I think you're taking it way too hard and maybe misinterpreted. First of all, even socially adept people struggle with getting a piece of cake (trust me, I've seen it at work lol). There's seriously nothing weird about it. Unless your family member is generally a dick and has something against you, I think he/she was actually trying not to ridicule you but saw an opportunity to defuse an awkward struggle and have a laugh with you and some light conversation. A conversation opener, an ice breaker. As in it's not you, but the situation they want to laugh of - and they wanted/expected you to laugh with them. Stupid piece of cake! Lol.

It's ok, no big deal. I think the problem with SA is that we try to think too much about saying or doing the right thing, when really, we need to just... think less. Care less. Normal people fuck up too, they just shrug and move on without obsessing over it like we've somehow conditioned our brains to."

"Did you ever get a piece of cake? I know you really wanted a piece and you absolutely deserved to grab a piece. 

Have you ever heard of LOOP earplugs? They sell them on Amazon. If you had them in this moment, I wished you could’ve put them in before getting a slice of cake and then when someone said something to you the words would have been barely audible to you and maybe — I’m not positive here — but maybe the noise of someone talking to you wouldn’t have bothered so much. Maybe you wouldn’t have been able to make out what they were saying or even that they were talking to you. 

I suggest this because I have severe social anxiety and LOOP earplugs, wearing them in public, helps with it. It’s almost mentally when I put them on, I’m not actually in the world, I’m just observing it with my eyes and can only hear muffled sound. 

Can you see if they help you? Get the ones that are labeled as “Quiet” and not the “Experience” ones — more sound is muffled out. Then when I want to increase my level of “challenge” - just to test myself when in a public setting - I will take out just one earplug to see if I can handle it.

"You have to train your brain to think differently. Do the things that cause you anxiety and tell yourself that it’s okay. Our brains don’t know any better (it communicates in behavior/patterns) and we confrim our fears by submitting.

Literally a few hours ago, I was anxiously contemplating whether to speak up in a room full of people and my heart was damn near beating out of my chest (actually moving my body). I did it anyway. And then afterwards I told myself that I’m proud for not agreeing that I had a reason to be afraid. And it felt satisfying. If you have to speak a little slower to gain breath control then do that!

Also try to be more present. If you were focusing in on the conversations that they were having at the table (don’t even have to actively participate, but just actively listen), you wouldn’t allow yourself to get caught up in whether or not everyone is worrying about what you’re doing.

"There are some tasks that we perform better with an audience, like music or sports, where our actions are practiced and there's no need for distraction, and some tasks we do better without attention as we adapt and let go of our immediate expectations quite often. For example, getting a stupid piece of cake to balance on a knife long enough to get it over onto your plate in some semblance of one piece as it tries everything to tip over and crumb apart and what the hell are all these cups and why didn't anybody realize this would happen and now my wrist's not working right, I mean it's fine but it's like cramping almost and now I've got to pay attention to that and try to scoop with a stupid knife and - yeah, it's a lot. It's a perfectly valid reason to have a panic attack, not that panic attacks care if they're valid or not when they show up.

Anxiety is excitement. Cake is exciting, social situations are exciting. Using all your willpower and coordination and senses of perception to move a stupid piece of cake while everybody is watching is the opposite of exciting. It takes a lot of energy to do a simple thing, and it disrupts and distracts with its intensity. Some people play into this, narrating as they go ""well don't I feel stupid, no no, keep watching - otherwise I'll cry and won't have any cake to soak up my tears"" some people are sarcastic ""I feel like I need to put on a show"" some people lean into it ""yknow I couldn't do this without all your support"". You don't have to say anything, you can even take a victory lap when done, no matter your actual degree of success. 

These things are just little distractions, letting attention go for a second so maybe you're not trying so hard and things can fall into place. Maybe do jumping jacks first, to warm up. Ultimately, whatever awkward thing you go through is hardest on you and nobody should be judging you for it because it could happen to anybody - and the point is you got relief and the cake! And cake is worth it, but I'm sorry you had to go through this to get there. It will be at least a little easier next time, for having gone through this, and also next time there will be more cake."

"I remember the moment my SA got the worst. 

I was in my mid 20s and I wanted to buy something from a gas station - like a pre-made sandwich or something. There was some dumb 16 year old kid manning the register and all I had to do was hand her the cash and take some change, but my hands were shaking so badly that I could barely do it. And knowing I looked so stupid made me spiral even harder. 

I mean I couldn't even hand a 16 year old gas station cashier a $5 bill without breaking down. This disease sucks!

Fortunately I got better. I was on Ativan for years which really helped, even after I got off of it. Then I did some exposure therapy and actually got really great at social situations. 

Lately it has come back though, due to being isolated for years. It's still nowhere near as bad as it was back then though. 

I feel for you OP. If you haven't talked to a doctor, I would try it and see if you can get on some kind of benzos that will make your anxiety melt away.

With time and practice, you wont dealing with this senario as much.

But its ok, these are the types of things youll burn into your own brain bc you 100% feel you messed it up, but in reality people forget afterwhile.

"i feel you, i went through a similar experience, also at family gatherings.
But i told my dad about the fact that i makes me feel very very uncomfortable when somebody of the family gathering speaks to me or watches me how i perform basic tasks, and he said that my thoughts are way too strict, i should get more into a “i don’t care” or “it doesn’t matter” mindset when things like these happen, especially when mistakes happen, since everyone is doing mistakes (it’s just human) and that sometimes only because of mistakes you are able to learn. 
He also told me that i see these situations way too seriously, like if i did a mistake and for example everyone at the family gathering stated laughing at me, it would normally affect me very very hard because i keep thinking of what the others think of me now or how they see me. He explained that sometimes stuff like this happens and that everyone at this family gathering forgets it happened maybe 45sec after the incident, that’s why i should stop caring that much.

Hmm classic social anxiety. I know how horrible this feels. For some reason I can’t read the other responses so I might just be repeating what others have said but, aside from obviously speaking to a doctor or other mental health professional, here’s some things you could try: make other people the centre of attention. As soon as you start worrying about how you appear to other people, flip your thoughts and, instead, put your focus on the other people instead of yourself. You could say “does anyone want some of this cake?” or even make the cake the focal point: “that cake looks amazing! I’m going in for the kill!” Anything that takes YOUR focus off what people may or may not be thinking about you and onto what people are thinking about ANYTHING ELSE. If the table’s too small and if feels like you are going to knock something over, just say it out loud. If you call attention to it out loud instead of internalising it you’ll worry a lot less because the focus is on the situation rather than your thoughts. Social anxiety is very good at creating a wall between you and other people, making you feel like an outsider. Talking about it is like kryptonite to superman - it’s the one thing that kills it because as soon as we tell others about it we put ourselves back in control and not an outsider anymore, “At the risk of drawing attention to myself, I’m going to cut into this cake first before it gets eaten!” Also, anyone that makes any comments most likely are not trying to make you feel awkward or negative, they’re just trying to be funny or make light of an awkward family gathering. They’re actually trying to connect with you by making a joke. They probably feel just as bad when they see their comment not go down well. Don’t let social anxiety make you think others are out to attack or judge you. Most people are not trying to harm you but actually connect with you. It could be that they’re just not very good socially either. Another thing you could do is research how many people in your country have experienced anxiety or suffer from social anxiety this year or some point in their lifetime. If you work that out as a percentage you can see on average how many people in the room are feeling anxious too. Somethings it helps to know that there maybe be 2 or 3 others in the room feeling the same or worse or suffering from another kind of mental health issue. You are not alone. Social anxiety is A LOT more common than your brain tells you while it’s happening. Social anxiety is a disease I have lost decades to but I’m starting to beat it. Just keep being social and keep calling your anxiety out and laughing at it. That way it doesn’t feel like part of your personality so much and it can help you bond with others who feel the same. We are all human but some people like to appear superhuman by hiding their problems. Be proud to be a human, don’t be cool. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)	HeyHoCharlie	reply	na	na	na	0.9992807507514954	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety

Family gatherings just suck for people with SA lol. I have a huge family and I always feel like I'm the center of attention when I'm at these gatherings with 60+ people for every holiday. I know I'm not actually, but everyone seems to want to make small talk and stuff with me and I'd rather just talk to nobody. I don't wanna seem rude by being one of the only few people in my family not going, so I usually go but then just leave early . I wish literally anyone in my family understood, but they're all so outgoing that I'm just the black sheep and they think I'm weird because I'm bad at talking to people lol. In reality I'm not bad at talking to people when I'm comfortable, it's just that when I'm around so many people (even those I've known my entire life) my anxiety is on 10 so it's stressful to even have a conversation.

Why should I enter into relationships (too early), if I can get broken by the other anytime?

Aren't we supposed to be ambitious, driven, responsible in life, instead of being reckless, erratic and boasting about just enjoying life?

This may sound over-cautiousness. My statements may even be contradictory to each other. But, what's the point of being silly in life and term it enjoyment, when life is already so complex? 

Why can't I enjoy life in other people's ways and get labelled as socially inept or soft-natured, when I have my own ways to enjoy life?"	futile_but_alive	post	20.252629318560093	female	White	0.9987074136734009	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety

"Tl;dr- I (22m) always had horrible experiences with narcissistic friends before and I'm slowly being drawn into another one who is (18m) please guide me on how to not get caught again. 

Some background, I (22m) always and I mean ALWAYS ended up becoming ""friends"" with narcissists. I guess its because of the way I was raised where it was literally a ""bad thing"" to do to stand up for myself. My sister has faced the same issue as well, so it's definitely not a me thing. Both of us have had trouble standing up for ourselves because we were forced to be ""good"" and ""kind."" And I think my dad is the primary reason why, but that's another story for another time. 

(You can ignore this part where I'm basically gonna talk about my past being friends with narcissists. 

7th grade this kid who I knew, but never talked to got transferred to my school van and we became friends very quickly. I had a large friend group and was in good terms with most guys my age, but after becoming friends with him, idk how it happened but i slowly started to hang out with him more and less with my actual good friends. He was also extremely rude and mean to me all the time because of which I began to have trouble sleeping at night. Long story short, I lost all my othe friends and ended up stuck with him. I said enough is enough and left him after which he cried and I out of my sympathy of people pleasing behaviour went back to him. I'm still friends with him and he is a much better person now, but traces of his past behaviour still sometimes come out, but I can deal with that. 

Another ""friend"" I made in 11th was so fucking horrible to me I don't even want to write the accounts of what happened with him, but basically I had to literally leave that school and join another one. He still stalks me to this day 💀. 

Then a I joined the same college as a childhood friend of mine who was a great friend when we were young. He became an asshole during 11th and 12th but I chalked it up to how guy's friendships involve a lot of insults. Fast forward 4 years this man ruined any bit of social skills I had, managed to take out every little bit of confidence I had left within me, and made my social anxiety worse. The shit he did to me got so bad that I literally couldn't continue studies and had to drop out (but there were also other reasons that caused me to drop out of college) i cut him off but he still thinks we are friends, but atleast I don't have to interact with him anymore (I hope😭)

(Now the part where I need help begins)

Now I have joined college again and it's literally been only 1 week and already I have become the target of a textbook narcissist who let's call A.

A ""playfully"" insults me all the time and it's really not helping me with my healing and is really making it hard for me to build confidence. He insults others too, but very rarely. I'm a clear target for his jokes. I sat in a different place yesterday to avoid his bs, but he followed me there as he ""doesn't want to leave me"". Luckily the place I sat I had two other dudes take up the whole bench and he had to sit alone in front of me. But today again I tried to sit in another place, and he followed me as he ""loves me"". 

I have begun to hate the word love because of all of the assholes I have mentioned before have used it to justify their behaviour towards me. Every single one of them have told me that their insults are just ""jokes"" and that they don't have any ""bad intentions."" 

I have atleast improved my confidence to the point where im able to atleast throw some insults back at him even though they are shit. I told him today that he's childish and he's like ""I know. I have no shame."" Which I needn't explain how much of a red flag it is. He keeps saying things like how he's a ""psychopath"" who can go on a ""killing spree"". He keeps saying how he enjoys bullying his friends and knows how to ""torture every type of person"". He shamelessly admits that he's judgmental of everyone. He also has an unhealthy obsession with girls. I could go on about this guy but im honesty tired rn

I want to get away from this guy before it's too late. Please tell me how to avoid this guy, or for him to leave me alone. Coming out of such relationships always involves ugly fights and I'm just really fucking tired of them. It's also kind of embarrassing for me because I'm 4 years older than him and I'm struggling to deal with him. 

My MAIN PROBLEM is that my SOCIAL ANXIETY makes me automatically smile every time he insults me or makes some joke at my expense which I think is the reason he's doesn't seem to understand that I don't want to be his friend. 

I would go into more detail, but don't want to the people I mentioned to figure out who I am. 

My anxiety is back because of this guy and I'm not able to focus on improving my skills and learning new things. PLEASE HELP 😭"	ivent0987	post	17.911560759545118	female	White	0.9980267882347107	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety

For example, I can have a lot of bravado on a date, in a corporate setting, at a networking event, or while presenting on a topic but still be quite insecure. On the other hand, I can accept my flaws and my anxieties, love myself, and just do my best. While I may not be as loud or as overtly confident, my insecurities won't be as loud as the first person, and that speaks a lot louder at the end of the day.

"""Bravado"" and Awkwardness are the two sides of being reactive (consciously or unconsciously seeking approval, reaction of other people).Confidence is something in the middle, when you are unreactive (calm, cold-blooded in any situation) and proactive (oriented to your values and goals)"	AdagioOutrageous3078	reply	na	na	na	0.0014325036900117993	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety
I agree, with a caveat. Feedback from others does play a role; if you know and accept yourself and present that way, but get enough negative feedback (especially if it's more negative than positive), it does wear you down after awhile. It may be as simple as people preferring apple pie over the blueberry pie that you're offering, but it's easier said than done to not wonder after awhile if something's wrong.

"It was always there, but it got so much worse lately. It’s bad, really bad by now. There isn’t a single day this doesn’t cause me major distress.

When around people, I either start sweating profusely or trembling severely, depending on what I do. I generally sweat when talking to people or if I’m even as much as in a room with people. I have a tremor when doing anything where people might look on my hands. Sometimes it was so bad that I couldn’t eat with other people at the same table, as the food would simply fall off the fork/spoon (yes even soup wasn’t safe) and even if some of it arrived at my mouth my tremor would make it difficult to actually put it in.

Additionally to that I’m socially awkward. This leads me to making some weird things and decisions that make me seem even more weird. Even if the symptoms (sweating and trembling) were gone, there would be no cure for this.

I can kind of do some basic conversation, but I can’t look people in the eye and am afraid to take anything a step further, which prevents me from building anything deeper than a superficial connection. Due to this I have never had any romantic interest in anyone and never even as much as held with anyone.

I honestly don’t see a way out of this. I think I won’t last much longer and just want this to end"	FoggsHon	post	18.42964838103046	male	White	0.9993155002593994	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety

"I've been struggling with anxiety for most of my life. I am now 31 and just recently felt I had it, kind of, under control, at least compared to before.   


I've been toying with the idea that I may have ADD for a while. It all started, in honesty, when I did methamphetamine (speed) one evening and noticed I became much calmer, could talk to people easily, and wanted to! I wouldn't advise anyone to go this route, just speaking of what I've experienced.   


Anyway, I used it modestly on 2-3 occassions while on the waitlist to test myself for ADD. The experience was always the same. A year and one diagnosis later (aka 2-days ago), I started taking Concerta.   


So far, the changes in my behavior have been impressive. I can actually hold phone conversations and compose myself enough to clearly communicate with people. I am no longer annoyed if someone breaks my concentration while in the middle of something, as I can easily jump back in. I also don't feel paralyzed with indecision, thinking about worst scenarios fully aware that won't help me. Overall, I think that I am much less reactive and can actually engage in planning my life, while I usually am forgetful, have a brain fog, and couldn't even visualize my future.  


They say that ADD is an executive functioning disorder, and that rings true for me. Note that I DIDN'T HAVE SOME SYMPTOMS PEOPLE USUALLY ASSOCIATE WITH ADD, which is why I hesitated with testing myself. Usually, they say people with ADD are very creative, have trouble standing still, with a mind that constantly jumps from topic to topic.   


However, there are many types of ADD, and I guess mine would classify as inattentive. So, I could pay attention to boring tasks and follow rules, believing I only had SA. Now I think much of my problems were caused by being overly sensitive, as ADD also causes emotional dysregulation.  


My worldview shifted considerably in just these 2 days. I suspect that this honeymoon phase will be over soon, but I'll make the most of it while it lasts. In what seems like years, I actually look forward to the next day...  


  
TLDR: My SA turns out to be mostly caused by ADD, and taking concerta helps me to manage."	Eyedea92	post	27.80470173279928	male	White	0.0025867095682770014	na	na	na	5	socialanxiety

Yeah agreed. Having SA… comes with a lot of baggage. Try to work on yourself first. Pursuing a romantic relationship should be way down the list of importance at 16. Maybe work on trying to be more communicative without the fear of judgement. Go out and try to initiate small talk, etc. That awkwardness will always be there if you don’t try to combat it now. I mean, I can see this same post but your age will be 40 and still don’t have a SO if you don’t gain some control over the effects of your SA.

"You weren’t even born yet when I was in high school lmoa. Trust me, there are men my age who have been terrible with women their entire lives.

Dating and courting as a man is relatively simple. For men, when you date, you have to have a solid plan on what activities you’re going to do together. A lot of men make the mistake of going “so what do like to do for fun?” This is a bore fest to women, and it can be an immediate turn off.

For me, even when I was a rejected, most women responded well to the fact that I asked them out, had a plan and was willing to take them out.

"This is truly sad but I noticed it in my group fitness class. I had 2 friends that came in together at the uni. One was majoring in engineering and the other accounting so careers that lend themselves to more introverted personalities.

I try to do a lot of engagement in class. Ask questions. Often times I would be met with silence which sometimes you just have to move on. Out of the 2 friends, one would seem to always engage with a response back and the other one was always much quieter like I didn’t hear much from her.

Well if I had to pick myself out of those 2 friends…. I would be the quieter one because I have SA. But I would say seeing it from the other side of the fence, the one that was more social/talkative and engaging left the better impression. She was so much more positively memorable. So this encourages me that I should just try to put myself more out there (ah SA just sux sometimes when it silences me so unnecessarily even though I’m an extrovert) because otherwise I’ll be easily forgotten/left with very little positive impact on someone."	sunnyflorida2000	post	24.12884849521941	male	White	0.025323478505015373	na	na	na	5	socialanxiety
"I relate. I’m an extrovert with social anxiety but I’m a high schooler right now. Being an extrovert really doesn’t mix well with social anxiety. I almost cry during class because I don’t socialize enough sometimes. I do have two friends, but I don’t really get much time to talk to them. 

But today I did make somewhat of an accomplishment. I asked a kid for his phone number! He is a awkward and nerdy kid. Maybe even has social anxiety. I have been trying to text him several times, but he has given me really dry responses. I’m not sure how to talk to him if he doesn’t talk more than what I ask him for.

See being extroverted does for sure give you an edge with having SA since your personality naturally derives energy from social interactions. It’s like a cheerleader! So way to go for asking him for his number. It’s almost like an enigma of being extroverted but having SA, it forces you to mask at times like an introvert.

Yeah I know! I had one friend make the comment that I seem to know everyone (I’m actually kinda nosy and will put in the effort to get to know someone) but another gym goer made the comment that I seemed very shy when I came into class (yeah that’s my SA and not me IRL). So it’s trying to live with these dual complexes. I do still think it’s better than struggling with SA as an introvert. As an extrovert, you can put more into the fight.

"I am sad. I am angry. I'm a broken and traumatized individual. I really want to fix myself, I'm doing so many efforts, but I feel so mentally tired because of that. But please let me know what you think about this, if you'll be patient enough to read it all. 

I have crippling social anxiety, but I'm also a vulnerable narcissist. Let me clarify, I'm not that kind of narcissist that doesn't own up to their mistakes shifting the blame on others, nor do I have issues accepting constructive criticisms. I find it easy to admit defeat, as I know it would be stupid not to, people catch up anyway and we all make mistakes. 

I feel extremely inadequate, very competitive but always at the bottom of said competition, I don't know how to love myself but I'm self-obssessed. The topic I can talk about the easiest is myself. Sad reality but I hate lying. I'm grateful when people help me, but I'm afraid they're doing it out of pity. I find it easy to love others, to forgive them if needed, to see  the best in them, but not when it comes to myself. Who the f-k said you can't love others if you don't love yourself? That's BS, IMO. 

I just want to be normal. I want to be able to have real connections with friends. I want to stop feeling the dumbest person in the room. I want to stop the brain fog, that blank, that chain that doesn't let me act like a regular human being.

"For context I'm 15 and today I went to the grocery store all alone for the second time (first time went well, luckily) and I feel so embarrassed even though a normal person wouldn't even give a second thought to this:


I entered the store (it's a tiny mom and pop store) and there was the clerk chatting with his buddy, and the second I entered they went silent and I started looking at the prices nervously bc I didn't know what snack to buy. 

Then I picked a bag of chips, but the price wasn't exact (imagine it was 6 dollars and I just had one 10$ bill with me) and I asked the guy if I could just give him the 10$ bill. He said yes, but the moment I tried taking the bill out of my wallet I grabbed it too hard and ripped it.
Then I started getting red and the guy just looked at me with a pity face and said ""oops, I can't take a torn bill... sorry""
And I said ""it's ok, I'll guess I won't take anything, thank you anyway"" then walked out.

I don't understand, whenever I have a mild inconvenience in a public space I get so embarrassed and can't stop thinking about the situation even tho it's the most insignificant stuff ever!!!
As I said, a normal person wouldn't care and go on with their life, but I just can't stop thinking about how much of a dumbass I must've looked like!! Anyways that was my story, is there any way I can get used to it so it's not as embarrassing anymore?"

"Yeah, I also feel humiliated about things that I think other people wouldn't normally get embarrassed about. I spoke up abruptly in class a week ago and I've thought about it everyday since then, I think I almost even cried over it. I've seen people do much worse things in class and as the outsider I didn't care-I can't even think of specific examples right now because that's how little importance the interactions had!
I think this happens because we've often been criticised about things by others and it's made us sensitive to criticism. In a way you're shielding yourself; if you think of everything as a threat and mentally beat yourself up over potential mistakes you've made then you're already preparing yourself for the perceived inevitable time you do actually get criticised/rejected. Your brain wants to protect you from harm by identifying everything it considers a potential threat and ultimately trying to dissuade you from going near it, except none of those things are *actually* harmful to you. We're not cavemen living in herds so a little social rejection won't leave stranded having to fend for ourselves. I'm sure you know that you didn't do anything wrong in the store, but your brain is so active and on the go that it perceives everything as a threat(what I've just said is content I remember from a video I watched ages ago so apologies if it sounds vague and unscientific). 

To be honest, I think the only thing I've found that has helped me with this type of thinking is building up my confidence. I'm still in the process it, of course, but I've found that being sure of yourself and and your behaviour generally has me being able to move on from painful mistakes quicker. Hell, sometimes I think to myself about my day and realise that I didn't even think twice when I did something I would've, in the past, beat myself up over. Recognising your negative thoughts and trying to think of them as a normal experience that people go through also really helps. Try doing some mindfulness techniques(esp ones for social anxiety havers) and look up unhelpful thinking styles. Doing those things will eventually help you cope better.

Also, to cheer you up a bit if you're still ruminating, 
I work in a relatively small grocery store and I think your interaction was beyond okay, really. I've had people come in doing and saying actually strange things and as a shop attendant, I do not care. We don't even remember someone unless they're overly kind or overly rude, I've noticed. I've had people trying to pay for things with foreign currency which I think is far more amusing than ripping your bill haha. 
I've had more socially anxious people come in, too, and I think they're completely fine, it's usually their overly self-conscious behaviour having them apologise for mistakes they didn't make, that has me realising how overly conscious of other people and themselves they are. But even still, people, myself included, don't mind, they will think you're shy, or really considerate because you're apologising to them for something that wasn't even all that bad. There could also have been a thousand reasons why the shop attendant stopped talking-they could've been gossiping so they didn't want another person to hear, or they could've just wanted to keep it professional by not looking idle and talking, I guess. It's totally fine and normal, so if you felt out of place or anything at the store, don't. You had a right to be there.

 This was really long and I rambled but I hope you manage to be kinder to yourself. You've recognised that you're humiliated over things that aren't that bad, which is great because that's a step toward being able to change your way of thinking one day."

Putting it off, ofc, then adds to my stress about not being able to get stuff done that needs to be done, which then just makes the whole thing worse.  


And whenever I'm at work and the phone rings (I work in a restaurant), I immediately distance myself as far as possible, so that I'm not the one responsible for picking it up since I'm not even close to it. Whoever's closest is expected to pick it up, so I just run away before anyone realizes I should've been the one to do it. I get anxious about a customer having a question that I don't know how to answer, especially if it's something that should be totally obvious and common sense and yet, for some reason, I just don't know it."

Basically trial and errors, and also the luck factor. The first few interviews went afwul (nervous, not making eye contact, insecure, difficulty speaking, forgetting things etc.), and I would get the rejection by phone or mail the next day.

"So I'm not a very talkative guy. You ask me about pretty much anything and I'll be able to give a few (humbly) very educated opinions. Talk to me about wood, I got you. Talk to me about grass, I got you. Talk to me about blueprinting and creating manuals, I got you. Talk to me about sports, I got you. Talk to me about computers, software, plastic, the environment, physics, whatever, I got you. It's still a small, few sentences long, discussion. It's not that much. If you talked to many people, I'd be forgotten. 

However, when I'm drunk and someone mentions my special interests, I'm going to talk them to death. I can talk and talk and talk and talk honestly pretty well and in a neutral and educational way but I'll just talk too much. I yap and yap and yap. It's like I have a body of yapping separated by a floodgate, and alcohol let's it all go.

I’m like that too haha. I stopped drinking though and I’ve found ways to talk to people! It helps to focus on the other person instead of yourself. I like to try and just make the person feel like everything they are saying is interesting. Honestly, usually it is interesting. Ask a lot of follow up questions, relate to them with your own stories if they come up in your head. If no stories come up, that’s okay! Maybe you know a fun fact or something you can share. It’s kind of a game, how many questions can I ask about what they just said? As you get more comfortable, you start to pick questions that you have a story or opinion on and then you’re having a conversation!	_Meisteri	reply	na	na	na	0.9979543685913086	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

It is a lot easier to break the ice when there is a common topic to help carry your conversations. You don’t have to focus on yourself so much, and that always helps a lot with taking away some of the pressure. 

You listed a lot of interests. If you find some local groups to join, it can help you expand your abilities to carry on a conversation with strangers because you will already know they have similar interests.

"I get it but you have to be your own cheerleader to be okay with being uncomfortable! Actually I would encourage you to embrace it. I know it sounds ridiculous. 

I’m an avid gym goer. I love doing dance formats and have been doing them for years. I was always a second row participant. I would never ever stand in the front row. My always front row friend would always try to get me up there. No way, Jose.

So crazy enough I became a group fitness instructor. Been one for about a year. It is still the most horrible mentally draining experience, each and every time. I dread instructing class (even though I absolutely love to dance) because of the effects of having SA and what it does to me. But I can now say, I no longer have that fear of going to the front row because … I’ve been on stage. Lol. So in that sense, I have bettered myself in many ways. I can holler across the room and not feel self conscious. I can talk to an audience and if they don’t say anything back, doesn’t bother me anymore.

If you push yourself to do something uncomfortable, eventually it won’t feel that uncomfortable anymore. You have to believe in the net gains at the end. Trust me, I still think about quitting everyday right before class. But I’m still instructing, to my surprise."	Gloomyou	reply	na	na	na	0.9994683861732483	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"I'm on a 20-year journey with SA. Here's a brief overview:  


1. Teenage Years: I didn't recognize my SA. I thought avoidance was the answer. Looking back, I see how destructive this was.
2. Up to 33: A period of exploration. ""Why me?"", ""What did I do wrong?"". Tried countless remedies: meditation, exercise, diets, cutting alcohol, no caffeine, quitting smoking, self-help books, Toastmasters, psychedelics, etc. The game-changer? A CBT book meant for therapists.
3. The Last 5 Years: Implemented CBT strategies. Massive changes followed. Today, I lead a conscious lifestyle - no social media, exercise, a diet without sugars or sodas, no alcohol/drugs, and a strict sleep schedule. Acceptance, lifestyle changes, and refraining from self-judgment after social encounters were crucial.

  
I wish someone had guided my younger self. I'd have progressed faster. Now, I'm eager to help others. I may not be a writer, but I can code.  
I'm not here for business ideas, but genuinely want to create a tool to help manage SA. I'd appreciate your insights:  


* Have AI therapy chatbots worked for you?
* Have diaries, meditation, or breathing exercises been helpful?
* Would an exposure app in a safe environment be beneficial?
* What about a peer-to-peer chat app moderated by AI?

I went through all that training and then they told us we had to stand up on stage and face the participants. I almost threw up and wanted to quit. But now… it doesn’t matter because if there’s few people in the class I back face them. If there’s a lot in the class, I have to suck it up and forward face. 

Obviously, if you’re not able to bear this, only choice is to leave or get on some meds and try to work through it. Everyday when I have to lead a class, it still sucks so hard mentally for me!

Basically the title. I have one internet friend who I message with most days and we just got into a fight and now I have literally no one to talk to. Which is probably good because all I have the urge to talk about is complaints. I really don’t know what happened to me. I’ve always been rather shy but until like halfway through college I had friends! Never a lot, but I always had several people I felt like I could talk to and have fun with. I was interesting and could have fun. Now I struggle to connect with anyone and am bitter. I have my parents and two siblings I get along with okay but I can actively feel myself annoying them and I don’t know how to change. I get really upset about stupid stuff and they don’t understand. And I’ve tried to put myself out there and make friends and I know it’s hard for a lot of people to do that as an adult but it’s just so stressful and exhausting and doesn’t seem worth it because I have yet to really connect with a single person. I have no one and I don’t know how to dig myself out of this whole. I’ve done therapy before and I recently started going again but honestly I’m not sure how much I can really help.

"Went on a date yesterday, my third first date in a year, felt like we had great rapport, similar interests, but she had to leave early because of a friend, and I noticed I can't see her highlights anymore on insta, and she's gone from my Hinge feed, I had a feeling, so I didn't message, but today she messaged hi and then said that we're not each others types in dating but she said I have a good heart and am a gentleman, and would like to be friends instead of cutting me off..

It's disheartening to hear that I have a good heart and am a gentleman, but still not good enough?

I appreciate her honesty but this is the same thing I always get, because of my SA, and I grew up with a mum and two sisters, I come across as a 'friend' and am not a typical cocky player type of guy.

Yeah I completely agree, but I think a break from the apps and self improvement is needed.

"This is a much better and healthier way of thinking and is totally normal. Almost everyone I know uses them in waves, get burnt out and then go back on.

I've been in burn out for a few months, and was a few months before that. People are exhausting. I wouldn't think to much into the reason she gave, that sounds super generic and a way to try and let down gently.

"Romcoms tend to exegerate ""big gestures"" and send a message that you should persist trying even though you were rejected, this is annoying, they will be a completa by the end of the movie bc is mean to be a romantic movie
But irl this wont happen often, that are social experiments videos on youtube like on CUT channel, were there are a diversity people together talking about their experiences like ""virgins talks to sex workers"" ""couple or friends"", etc
Reality shows might be an option too, from there you can pick a side from what you like or what feels akward
Like trying to flirt although both of you dont have nothing in common seems akward for me (hannah trying to flirt with trey on too hot to handle s5)
Confidence is key, but keep it balanced, not high enoguh, you might sound obnixous, but not low
Crossing arms might be a sign that the person or you is not interested
Dont look down often
Keep eye contact, if the person looks back and stay for while, might be a sign for interest, although you might have to look somewhere to just not be staring the person weirdly, dont do sudden moviments, like a person that quickly turn his vision to a direction of a sound that scared you, this might seem that you are not corresponding to the eye contact that person done to you or your insecure.
There will be times when you might need to talk to get something of someone, in others moments you can objetive
Talking a lot while you dont flirt at all might take you to friendzone
Dont complimment the person that much, might make the person uncomfortable and dont make complimments be the only thing you have to say
The way you talk mathers (T3:E5 of Never Have I Ever 13:34 min) there a lot going on there, there this guy teaching a girl how to invite someone to a date. He used the same words, but demonstrated his interest and confidence ( smilling, getting closer, eye contact, look up and down like he's ""scanning"" her and gently smiling  sending a message that he liked what he sees, he even frowns in a single word) its a short time flirt but slowing it down, you might found it that we might be unexpressive during our flirts or any conversations, so try it out for yourself, try it on the mirror or camera.
Be careful, if you get closer and the person get a step back that might be a signal thats the person is not comfortable with that or not interested.
Theres a lot more like a soft bite on your lips sideways, demonstrates a higher interest, most sexually wise most of the time.
Upright posture, stuffed chest (dont exegerate), looking up sends a confidence vibe, but the inverse might tell you insecure.
Plenty of things, might be a personal thing, ppl like different things, watch something, you might learn a thing or two from ppl that you appreciate their social skills.
Be reasonable, distinguish what is real from whats not from the shows you watch. Watch how other people do it in parties too, IRL might help you distinguish those, if you cant watch other people doing it, you can always try it out by yourself."

"So my family and I moved to this new town and of course I had to move to a new school. Since I won't be with the people that I was already familiar with, my anxiety became worse. I was worried and panicking what would be my classmates and teachers be like for weeks.

Fast forward to our first day, the school decided to call all grade 4 to grade 10 students in one of our campus. I decided to tell my mom that I would just walk to get to school since it's not that far away from us. My mom let me so I went ahead and walked to school, which was a big win for me because I could never walk outside because of my anxiety.

When I got there, everything was going well until my classmates approached me. They weren't the problem... I WAS. They were nice and started to ask questions about myself since they wanted to know more about me. Our little conversation was going fine until they asked me what games do I play and what are my hobbies. Now since they all play games that I don't and can't play and I really didn't know them enough to be able to relate to them, I became frozen and I didn't respond to their questions because I was afraid that they would judge me. 

Since they weren't getting any response from me, they decided to have their own conversation instead. Then I heard one of them say ""This guy is hard to talk to"". I felt so dumb because I wasn't able to answer a question easy as that. I felt like I threw my golden ticket to having some new friends because of that stupid mistake.

Also because of my anxiety, I often make this expression that suggests discomfort, and because of that, my classmates and teachers often asks me if I'm okay or not. I know they are just being nice but for me, I feel like there's something wrong with me and that I don't belong with them.

I was able to walk on my own to school and I was also able to talk to one of classmates so I guess it wasn't all that bad.

I want to actually have new friends this school year, so please give me some advice that can help me. Thank you in advance..."	Bluver30	post	14.399574444413922	female	White	0.9990723133087158	na	na	na	3	socialanxiety

Since I could remember my peers have let it known im not wanted around and I had no friends and I figured out it was my personality and I analyzed my actions and what to do and what not to do.

Im an anxious mess, I get afraid trying anything that isn’t shopping. I don’t talk to people I work with and they don’t know me.

I am not sure how to stop caring but I don’t know what else I care about. I stopped enjoying things because people didn’t like how excited I got about it. I stay quiet because I don’t know what to say. My mind literally goes blank.

Stay in that goddam bathroom as long as you need. As a socially anxious person, you need time away from huge crowds, or at the very least time to prepare for them. There's really nothing except hiding that you can do about this sudden anxiety, unless you're open to SA meds like Xanax which I don't personally recommend.

If the bathroom easily gets crowded full of people waiting, I'd suggest somewhere secluded outside, in your car, or a bathroom that's kinda hidden. There should be little hiding spots, and if worse comes you worse you can let a teacher know and maybe they can help you find an empty classroom to chill in.

"I’m making mistakes still, I’ve had two disasters of performance anxiety, I’m still filled with anxiety, self loathing, depression, body dysmorphia and every other mental illness in the book. Still feel low in moments but…

I didn’t let it stop me.

My weeks filling with plans. I’m talking to people, messaging friends more, planning more. Have dates lined up. Even decided to send a message to a random person to meet for coffee in a Starbucks for 20 mins as he was just wondering about and now we have a proper date lined up Saturday. 

A random person asked for my number a few days ago and old me would have left it at that and not respond out of anxiety… but I did and now I have his Insta and I might even ask to meet soon!

Took a gamble on messaging a random extremely attractive person in another country on a dating app, exchanged pics and info and told him I’m in another country and we’re still talking even talking bout  meeting if I’m there next month. Old me would have said hi and ignored the response being anxious I’d be turned down and nothing would come off of it.

Visited someone in his town today, met at his place, and he’s one of the nicest people I’ve met, confidant and that ticks every relationship box from attraction to personality etc. who wants a relationship… that I turned down! Something I would have jumped at all my life like I had to hold onto the attention that a person like that gave me yet I’m the one that had to say no, little anxious me!

To some people these aren’t major, to some I might be moving too fast given my nature. All this could also implode in my face and I’ll not even be speaking to these people again… but that’s not the point 

In a week I’ve done what me two weeks ago, and the me of all my life, would never have attempted. 

I used to be a hermit for large parts of my life! Sat at home keeping to myself. Gaining weight and wasting away on tv and video games. 

And it’s like I’ve shattered something… discovered something. It’s not a night and day thing. I’m not suddenly fixed. I will still have my lows, I’ll still fuck up. I’m still repulsed by my physical appearance and mind… But I’m learning, I’m moving. I’m trying.

Honestly it’s not going to be easy for you or come naturally but I think having that realization and talk with yourself that yeah putting yourself out there is probably going to be very uncomfortable for you and nerve wracking but you’ll have to kind of force yourself to get out of your comfort zone. The more you put yourself out there even if it doesn’t go as intended the more experience you’ll get and the more comfortable you’ll become over time. It’d be good for you to try to find something to do outside or just dating apps whether that’s going to a gym going some club that you have a hobby in and I recommend that not just for the potential of meeting someone you’d be interested in but it’ll help you develop your social skills which will help your dating life. I can’t really give advice on how to approach or ask someone out as a girl whose never approached anyone but I think you just have to fake it till you make it with confidence and realize that you may get rejected but that that’s okay, there’s only so many people in this world that you’re going to be truly compatible with so you can’t expect it to go well with everyone. Also No’s are free, you might feel why should I they’ll probably say no but the thing is you’ll be in the same position if you didn’t ask at all so you should at least give yourself the chance.

"I finally was brave enough to apply for a job, then pick up the phone to call back  then go on my first day of work and endure the first week.  My coworkers seemed weird to me, some of them seemed hostile. After 2 months we had an after work aktivity..we went bowling and that one hostiöe coworker was nice to me, encouraging me at bowling, making high fives when i did good. Then she got drunk and seriously told me for several times how she's the ""right hand"" of our boss and what i should be doing better at work. Then she asked me if i liked the work i'm doing and i said half concimcingly yes. Next week I resigned frm the job.

I know it's because of that strange coworker and also because I'm scared of my boss because sometimes he has a temper and that reminds me of my father and i just can't stand that.

I feel so weak for resigning and for being so scared of my coworkers. I feel like I'm running away grom conflicts and that one weird coworker. But i know that i also didn't like the tasks i had to do.

"i (17m) barely have any friends and i have a lot of anxiety surrounding friendship and the idea of making friends. this summer i decided to take an art class in order to make friends. it started monday and ends tomorrow. i promised myself i would make friends, but every time i try to talk to someone i get scared because i feel like everyone hates me. so far i’ve spent every day having lunch alone hating myself and trying not to cry. 
today though, one of the other people in the class started talking to me, and it felt so great. i’m mad at myself for not trying to talk to people earlier, because now i’ve wasted almost the entire week. i really want to be friends with him, but i’m scared of seeming desperate. i could ask to have lunch with him tomorrow, but even if that happens, what if i never see him again after the class? i feel like it’s hard to keep up a friendship over only text, and i’d be embarrassed to give him my instagram since i only have one follower and it’s my brother. 
i don’t know what to do, i’m terrified of losing this opportunity. 

i’m sorry if this seems whiny or self-pitying, this is just very difficult for me.

UPDATE
we had lunch together today, and it was really great. however, about halfway through he said he was going to the bathroom and that he’d see me later. i didn’t know if he meant later like after the bathroom or later like when we got back to class, so i just left. i was scared that i messed up, but later on during class we talked more and i got his number and his instagram. overall i think is consider this a win. i really hope we keep in touch."

100%, sometimes I feel like I’m watching a movie where everyone in the world is in it except for me. I think the only way this feeling will go away is by getting out into the world more.

exactly how it is for me. ive never been able to fit in anywhere. i thought maybe its because im fat so i developed anorexia and lost a shit ton of weight, oh but i still dont fit in. maybe its because im bad at makeup, so i was sitting for hours everyday obsessing over makeup to try and look the part and nope still no friends. maybe its my outfit/style, so i would wear the exact same clothes as the other girls at work to look cool like them. to then be 20 and find out i could potentially be autistic. im going to not to hold onto that for too long though, as you never know it might come back as me not having it but completely feel you though ive made posts about this before. everyone has been programmed correctly to say and do the right things at the right time but i havent. i feel like an alien just like you, just watching on the outside how other people communicate and interact. its painful and i have thought about ending it a few times because of this	max1necampb3ll	reply	na	na	na	0.9991642236709595	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

I mean think about our world: we have babies, force them to enter a brainwashing institution called school, then force them to go through the same shit to get a worthless degree only to work a 40h hours a week for no money, to buy a house we can never pay, to pay for the children we cannot afford, and who will die from climate change, only to serve a capitalistic hierarchy of company owners who see us as nothing but slaves...

Sometimes, I wonder if people like us are actually the ""normal ones""....

Sorry, it makes me sound like a crazy rambler, but maybe it gives you a different perspective because I feel what keeps a lot of people with anxiety from getting better is that they feel they need to be like the normal ones, instead of accepting that issue and looking out for yourself and loving yourself despite this issue...only that way can you ever hope to get better...to find a way to cope with it, since neither therapy nor medication can guarantee that everything goes magically away...stop looking at yourself as if you are a freak...you are not at all."	max1necampb3ll	reply	na	na	na	0.9991642236709595	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety

You aren't afraid of the store or the people there. You are afraid of yourself because after you leave the store, you are going to mentally punish yourself for everything you did based on how to you failed to be cool/smooth/ extroverted or whatever personal standard you judge yourself against. Now Everytime you go out in public you are freaking yourself out because later you know the self inflicted mental punishment is coming. In the store, were you kind? Yes? Ok then you did great! No need to punish yourself. You didn't do anything wrong as long as you were kind.

How often do you congratulate or encourage yourself in social situations? I'm guessing you constantly analyze and cringe at every dumb or weird thing you ever did. This will quickly make you associate certain situations with pain. It's easy to reverse. Did you do a weird thing? Great, you were brave! Bravery is good.

"My brain basically tries to paint everything I do in a bad light. For example, I'd been cooped up inside all day yesterday, so I decided to take a night walk around town, I put on a hoodie and some shorts, grabbed some headphones and went out. All I was doing was walking down the street, minding my own business, listening to music. So why does my brain feel the need to tell me that what I was doing was kinda weird and creepy? I will admit, as I was walking, I saw this red thing and I couldn't quite make out what it was, as I got closer, I realised it was a person stood talking to someone in their front garden. I felt really weird about accidentally staring them down. 

If you asked me to describe exactly how I was acting creepy, I couldn't say. ""The vibes were off"" I guess. But my brain just seems to connect me doing anything with being creepy. 

I get stuck in this weird mindset where I can't tell if I'm actually acting weird, it's all in my head or it's a bit of occasionally acting weird and my brain using that as proof to assume I'm always acting weird."

"'Creepy' word itself is not defined properly. How can you determine something is creepy? It's a reflection of your self-worth I think. Let me explain it to you in a organized way:

Your brain is running a bad program:

I_love_myself = False

if I_love_myself:
      my_self_worth = 'High' 

else:
      my_self_worth = 'Zero' 

If my_self_worth == 'Zero':
      Anything_I_do = 'Creepy' 
else:
      Anything_I_do = 'Normal'

Now, ask yourself, do you love yourself? If not, then try to love yourself first and assign a new boolean value True inside I_love_myself. Your program will now give 'Normal' output.

Yeah I know, I am also creepy like you, my explanation was creepy as hell. I used programming language to explain your mindset lmao. If you think creepy, then whole world is creepy. It's all in your head."	DaftGuard7	reply	na	na	na	0.9974938631057739	no	no	strong	na	socialanxiety

"Hello,

I come from a family which values productivity and speed of action, assertiveness, power, dominance.

I guess my anxiety doesn't match up to their values. Due to this anxiety, I can appear hesitant and doubtful during social occasions. I always get called weak, slow and sentimentally silly from my parents, and they compare me with others.

I guess from this is from their POV, I can understand it if I stand in their shoes.

Maybe I should believe in myself more and make more decisive decisions, and my anxiety won't be as bad.

You could either leave it as is, and look at the experience as validation for your anxiety, continuing your self deprecating thoughts - or you could try again. You said yourself that you know how you could have asked, well, that opportunity is still there.

Hearing them laughing in groups while i’m walking alone in a country that isn’t even mine is killing me. help.

"That sounds like a mix of fearing the rude girls and also awkwardness with wanting to look or talk to the pretty girls.

The rude girls might make you anxious because wanting or not, we end up needing some kind of belonging where we are and those girls are pretty much a physical representation of not belonging. 

Their opinions don't speak for everyone so you should try your best to not mind them or anything they say.

About the pretty girls, it's okay to want to look at them or talk to them, but it also can feel very awkward to not be able to, and just keep staring and i think your anxiety comes mostly from this sense of being too ""pushy"" or ""rude"" when wanting to be around them.

I don't think there's much to do other than building the courage to talk to them or try and get used to not minding them too."	Infamous_Olive6627	reply	na	na	na	0.9895966649055481	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

I actually have this friend who tells me he loves it when I ramble bc he loves seeing what I have to say about things, but even with him I still have this habit of apologizing for going so overboard and making him have to read so much.  


The same goes for social media. I just recently joined Reddit and have joined some servers relating to some of my favorite shows. Next to memes and fluff posts, people will often post questions/discussions about our opinions on certain aspects of the show, which is super fun for me! I absolutely love breaking down and analyzing shows, especially when it comes to characterization, so these types of posts are often my favorite to engage with.  


However, I've come to notice that whenever people comment on these posts, their comments tend to be a simple paragraph or even a line that perfectly summarizes their answer, while I often write a few paragraphs worth. I mean, I do try to control myself, bc I know people don't always want to read such lengthy comments, so I try to keep it short as best I can with a cap of about 2 or 3 paragraphs max (And keeping the paragraphs themselves just a few lines each). But I still notice that mine tend to be quite significantly longer than other people's. And in the few occasions that I do write something simple and straightforward, people seem to be much more responsive to it compared to my longer ones.   


It really sucks, bc I never really feel like I have the chance to talk about these things with people. Having those opportunities to actually express what I'm feeling and organize my thoughts on a subject that's very meaningful to me always makes me feel so good and free. I have so much fun when I finally get to express myself. But there's always this part of my mind that feels embarassed and even guilty whenever I start rambling so much to people. I've become a bit convinced that people don't really care about what I'm saying. Or that they don't even understand what I'm saying bc a lot of times, as I write, my perspective morphs into me thinking my rambling is turning into babbling that doesn't even make sense, so I'm just wasting these people's time in making them read something that's just complete word nonsense (it's actually happening rn as I'm typing). And they're probably getting pretty annoyed at seeing such long messages to read in the first place. And I feel like people might think that *I* think I'm some kind of connoisseur on the subject and think I'm smarter than all of them, bc of how long my message is. So, they just end up passing me up and not really giving my thoughts a chance bc they don't want to feed into the ego they think I have. (Which I know is totally not true, I'm not trying antagonize the people who don't read my long messages. This is just one of the perspectives my brain keeps feeding me, that maybe I come off as arrogant with my long posts, when I'm really not trying to be smarter than everyone else).   


Even as I'm writing this post, I'm noticing how long it's getting and am starting to think I'm rambling too much when this could all be summarized in a much simpler way and that isn't such a pain for people to read. Will people actually make it to the end of this post, or will they give up halfway through bc there's just too much? And if they do read it all, did any of it even make sense or is it just a bunch of word salad that doesn't make any sense? Are they annoyed at me bc of this? I don't know and it makes me stressed and also just sad. What's the point of trying to express all of these thoughts I have if no one is there to listen and understand? If all my talking just ends up getting on people's nerves? At that point, I'm just talking to myself, which I already do enough of irl. And it's getting pretty lonely."

You find yourself fully immersed in the moment, as the promise of enjoyment consistently triumphs over anxiety. Personally, I experience this when a new feral cat enters my backyard. Suddenly, I forget that my neighbors might be watching, and I launch into 'Operation Befriend the Cat.' I tend to go overboard, sometimes using up cat treats I actually need for the month, all in my desperate attempts to befriend or pet the cat. Similarly, you tend to overshare and inadvertently disregard people's attention spans. This outcome is a natural result of not having enough opportunities to truly be yourself and be happy in other areas of your life.

"ty for your thoughts and for reading everything lol! Your explanation is really well put and makes a lot of sense. It's true that I often get so hyper focused in the thoughts that I'm writing out that I don't realize how much I've written until I've already gone pretty deep. Then I have to go back and edit to try and trim everything down. 

Your understanding is very comforting, tysm. And also, I really love cats too! When I start living by myself, I'd love to have a cat friend of my own 💕"	Annawings1	follow-up	na	na	na	0.005159799475222826	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

I understand, logically, that a lot of these ideas about what people think are just in my head, but that doesn't stop it from getting to you, you know? Just constantly doubting what the real truth is. So, sometimes, you really just need to hear it straight from someone, so thank you, really! 

Especially the part about how some people not having much to say in response, even if they appreciated the whole of what they're responding to. I do notice that when people respond to my behemoth messages with brief responses that only cover a little of what I was talking out, that it does get to me a little. Like, oh maybe they didn't really care about what I was saying and they're just trying to quickly humor me with a response so we can move on, or something like that. 

So, what you said about that is actually a really great thing to hear. You can appreciate and understand something to the fullest without the need for words. I really like that, tysm!"	Annawings1	follow-up	na	na	na	0.005159799475222826	strong	no	no	na	socialanxiety

I of course like many people come from a troubled background. I have come to the realization that I’ve isolated myself to protect myself from being used or judged. It’s so difficult to make genuine friendships and meet people when I work from home (worked from home as an auditor for 8yrs) coworkers live all over the country and I’m the only one in New York. Family has used me so badly i don’t want anything to do with them. Going out with my husband is also a fail because he too has severe anxiety. What do you guys do to ease this feeling of loneliness and isolation? The only thing that seems to help these days are gardening and coloring but other than that I’m so alone.

Lean on each other to hold the other accountable, and work towards this together. You have both have a very close support person who can empathize with your specific situation - you can use this to your advantage. This is, if your husband also wants to make progress. The things I find I can do a lot easier (with pretty much just pure adrenaline lol) are things that I'm doing for someone else, rather than myself (which I know, I need to work on), but maybe you can use that feeling of accountability to pull each other forward?

I have a hard time with social contacts, which makes my friends and family roll their eyes all the time. I refuse to go out with friends if I know there will be guys I don't know with them. I can't say hello to the neighborhood kids, which makes the neighbors think I'm rude. I can't communicate normally with distant relatives, so when they come to visit us, I always stay in my room. I'm constantly asking for someone to call the delivery line instead of me. And many, many more things that make me constantly stress my significant others out. I don't think they understand me. When I try to explain the reasons for my behavior, it sounds so stupid every time, I'm sure I'm annoying them. My parents seem to think I'm engaging in infantile nonsense.

"Vent about how social and general anxiety trigger my suicidal tendencies, and how it feels impossible to get help: 

I have BPD and being suicidal is a very regular thing for me. I usually feel suicidal when I am triggered by something like a fight with a loved one. But I also feel suicidal when I push myself too hard.. like struggling to write a paper, or failing to do something easy. Pushing myself too hard is where my anxiety and BPD meet. 

I have very extreme social anxiety. I can barely answer the phone. I miss important appointments all the time because I cannot bring myself to interact with others. Every time I talk to ANYONE, even my own friends, I have to hype myself up so much. I almost always have an anxiety attack before any interaction. I push myself too hard, expecting to be a normal person, and then I feel like shit when I can’t do it.. ie talking to people, participating in class. 

My BPD makes me hate myself for it. I’ve run off after class to self harm because I couldn’t bring myself to raise my hand to ask a question. I hate myself intensely after every phone call, every social interaction, every time I fail to be normal. 

I never used to be like this. I’m 22 and my anxieties are only getting worse. I really feel like nobody understands the severity of my social anxiety. And understandably, nobody is willing to go through the the extra effort of  merely helping me make it to my appointments. I can’t force myself through my anxiety because it makes me want to kill myself. 

I can’t get the help I need because I need too much help just to get help. How can I help myself if just making phone calls makes me genuinely want to die? 

Trying to help myself makes me feel suicidal.

Edit: Thank you so so much to everyone for your comments. I’ve never been able to relate to anyone else in this way. I’m not as alone as I thought. I feel such validation. And to everyone in the same boat, let’s keep fighting together. We’re probably more capable than we feel."	gingfreecsisbad	post	16.006249883398034	female	White	0.005259065888822079	na	na	na	54	socialanxiety

"I think you're more capable of helping yourself and being helped than you think. You made this post, after all, asking for help from strangers on a platform that varies anywhere from being incredibly kind to absolutely awful. You replied to a comment from a complete stranger. You took the first necessary steps.

Maybe it's just baby steps, but every step you take is progress to getting better. It doesn't matter if you're taking giant leaps or the smallest of steps. You're making progress, and that's all that matters. Don't worry about rushing it, everyone has their own pace. You'll get there.

At one point, you'll feel confident enough to reach out to a therapist. Or maybe you'll still be terrified, but you'll face it head on. Once you do, you have to do the next most terrifying thing: trusting that someone else can help you, wants to help you, even if they don't fully understand how you're feeling.

I know, it's so hard. The one thing everyone says to do when you're depressed - talk to someone. The one thing people with social anxiety can't do is talk to people so they can't even do that! It's so isolating, the loneliest condition. I know it's so much easier said than done but you need a good therapist that gets it. Even if they don't experience it themselves, someone that understands and is empathic to the condition. You may need to try multiple therapists to find that. And I know, that's so difficult because it involves contact with another human. But the only thing that worked for me was exposure therapy by going to therapy every week and it was painful for so long but now I do with little to no anxiety.

Because one day, you're going to take that step, and it will be difficult and scary, but you'll feel such relief afterwards.

I've had some really dark times. And when my social anxiety, general anxiety and depression has been at its worst, I couldn't make a phone call. I couldn't walk out the door. I couldn't feel anything but despair.

Then one day, I just picked up the phone and made a call. I was shaking. I was crying. I didn't know what to say. So I said that. I told the person on the other end of the phone that I wasn't even sure what to say. And they said ""That's okay"". And it was. They asked questions, they talked to me, I did my best to answer and I got through it. And I felt so much better at the end of the phone call. Not good - good was a ways off. But better. Relieved.

And exhausted. I slept for 12 hours. And when I woke up, I looked at the notes I'd made during that call, and I picked up the phone again. I called my doctor and made an appointment. That was scary and difficult too, but it was another small step. Felt pretty huge, though. I opted for a phone appointment, because it wasn't as scary as going in person. I kept reminding myself of that - talking on the phone will be scary, but not as scary as going in person. And the next day, when my doctor called, I answered. Another small step that felt huge.

It was the beginning. I had a lot of steps ahead of me. But every day I reminded myself of the steps I'd already taken.

You're going to get to that beginning, too. Be patient with yourself. Forgive yourself. When another day has passed and you haven't made that call or taken that first step, tell yourself that it's okay - you'll try again tomorrow. Do that for as many days as it takes until you get to that day where you actually take that step. Because like I said, that day *will* come.

I can't even imagine what it must feel like to have both. I'm really sorry but at least in terms of SA, it is curable. You can try exposure theorepy  where you gradually overcome fears.

Social anxiety is a real struggle I've been dealing with my whole life. It is a nightmare at times. Just know that there are so many people out there struggling and you're not alone. It's sometimes hard to find people who understand or some advice sounds so unhelpful like just be yourself or something like this. In my own journey I've learned that the mind, our human brains are unbelievably powerful and can create the life of our dreams or put us to shambles based on how we learn to use it. I like to think of the mind somewhat as a PS999 or computer so advanced with a million switches and we can learn to use it to benefit our lives tremendously. I can't offer specific advice but just remember that our minds can be amazing if we can dig deep into ourselves or learn how to think in more constructive ways. Never give up. My mom grew up with terrible anxiety in the 60s and she has learned to overcome it and public speaks, got a high education and isn't afraid of anything now it seems. Remember that it is a journey and any little steps or risks you take to boost your social skills add up and create change.

"At least for SA, the exposure therapy helps lesson the fear of being judged. Because you slowly conquer irrational fears once you start to notice while it may be extremely awkward, the outcome is usually less severe than you imagined. 

Another thing that also helps is cognitive behavioral therapy. Because of my trauma from being bullied, I assumed everyone was a bully so I shut down from society. This is actually faulty thinking and I realize it now. It's actually a small percentage of people that are bullies, usually the very vocal ones and even then they are trying to compensate for their own low self esteem by making others feel bad.

"I am not diagnosed by a professional, but I believe I have social anxiety. I have no friends and 0 social skills.

Two months ago, I got a promotion at work and even though I was really happy, it's been quite stressful for me as I have to talk to people on a daily basis and we have to do zoom meetings (which is something I haven't done before).

I get nervious, sweating everywhere and I cannot even talk. I usually write down all I want to say, but today, our boss congratulated me specifically for the way I handled a difficult case. I was speechless. I could not even say thank you and there was a 2 -second silent pause.

I am afraid I might have came off as rude or ungrateful. It was not my intention at all.

"So I teach a group fitness class (cardio dance and hip hop fitness) to both 55+ audience and a 25 and under college kids. I do feel the younger kids are a lot more judgmental. I’m younger than the Senior community but much older than the kids like I can be their mom’s age. Actually I have a daughter who’s going to be a sophomore at the same uni I teach. That was the whole point of doing it was to see her at least once a week. And no, she’s never stepped foot into my hip hop fitness class. Even though we hardly look alike and I told her I wouldn’t even acknowledge her as a relative but, no… she’d rather die than come to my class.

Anyways, today I had the microphone strapped to my head and I was giving verbal cues to my seniors and than I found myself making small critical comments about when I messed up. I had several of the ladies tell me not to vocalize any mistakes, just keep going…. 

Okay. Feeling like I should drink beforehand because it is so hard not to out and judge myself. Any advice on how to stop being so self critical? I grew up in a very demanding, high achieving family. And I feel like I’m so used to hearing some voice judging and criticizing me, but now it’s my own voice since I no longer live with my parents.

"Thanks for your reply but this wasn’t really asking for advice how to instruct the class and how to read the audience to tailor that instruction. I’ve been teaching for almost a year and have had training and mentorship. I’m also a licensed group fitness instructor so I have the basic know how, passing an extremely hard test to be certified in leading a GF class. 

My question again was how NOT to vocalize doubts or self criticism while I’m instructing. For instance, “ok. Opps. Messed up on that move. I guess I need to practice my left side more.” This is something I should not vocalize out loud. And I don’t know how to stop being so self critically especially vocally during class. It prob gives a bad impression of my confidence level. And that’s why my seniors were trying to encourage me just to move on and not bring attention to my mistakes. But isn’t this the crux of SA, the constant doubts and fear of judgement? And I’ve manifested it by vocalizing it for my entire class to see and hear.

"A little context about myself, I was a decently social kid back in elementary and during my first year of middle school. I had friends but of course, I was still a little shy and a bit self-conscious but not to the degree I am now. When the pandemic and quarantine happened, after quarantine, it had been so long since I interacted with any kids my age and I feel like I missed out on a crucial part of my life after completely missing the last quarter of 7th grade and all of 8th grade which caused my social skills to diminish severally. Once quarantine was over I probably would have been fine if I had started interacting with my old friends from middle school again and slowly gotten back into being social but I moved to a different state immediately after once quarantine ended and started at a new school my freshman year with the social skills of a brick wall.

Fast forward to now and I’m currently a junior and I still don’t have friends and I honestly don't know what to do anymore, maybe I’m just being pessimistic since it’s only my first day and i still have the rest of the year but I always think the next year will be different but it always ends the same with me having found zero friends. I know high school is supposed to be a fresh start but most the people at my school already had friends because of middle school or even farther back in elementary school. Originally back in my freshman year, I got lucky and somehow made two friends and we mainly hung out as just the three of us during the first semester of the year but they both were really extroverted and got popular fast so they both found their own group of friends and we kinda never really hung out as just the three of us after that. One of my two friends is really nice and offered to me multiple times for me to just hang out with her and her friends during lunch and I originally tried that but I always felt awkward and out of place and never really knew what to talk about with her or her friends since I didn't even have classes with any of them so I kinda gave up on doing that and mainly just sat alone the year after that.

Anyways I’ve tried to make friends by joining clubs at my school but the only club that I liked was art club and even then people already had their own friends there or were too shy to talk, like me. The club also only met up once a month so it didn’t give that much time to really get to know anyone. I kinda talked to a few of my classmates during my sophomore year but I never really clicked with anyone. There was only one girl I genuinely liked talking with my freshman year but we only ever talked in class since we didn’t have the same lunch period or other shared classes and by the end of the school year we didn’t really talk anymore and I feel stupid for not pushing myself out my comfort zone to get to know her more when I couldn’ve became friends with her.

It just makes school so much more miserable going the entire day not speaking more than 5 words to anyone and on top of that the phone policy this year is even stricter so I can’t use my phone at all during any class besides lunch so i can barley text my online friends even just a little bit through out the day. I just don’t want to miss out on the fun things in high school like literally just interacting with other people or going to dances and stuff but my social anxiety keeps stopping me from actually trying to change something about it. I made it a goal that I want to at least go to prom my senior year because I’d regret it if I didn't go but I also don’t want to do it alone so i’m trying to at least find one friend to go with by my senior year but I’m finding it harder to make that actually happen. 

I’ve sometimes contemplated just moving back to my original state and going to the same high school where my old friends are at because my father still lives there so i could just move in with him but even then my old friends already have their own friends and it’d just be the same situation with feeling out of place with my friend from freshman year and her friends but it probably wouldn't be the same regardless since i haven’t seen my old friends since 2021. Anyways this is really long I’m just tired of being alone and wanted to rant😭"	Head-Ad-6343	post	16.78541039812188	female	White	0.9991101622581482	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety
Hey man first off like you said this was only the first day and that’s the hardest one. There was a lot to your post so I’ll just give you some tips as someone who survived high school while being overly anxious. 1. Initiate conversations with the people around you. Ask someone their name, make jokes/comments about the class, answer a question in front of the class, or even ask someone for a pencil. The key is to establish a line of communication so that person your talking to and others around you feel familiar with you which will eventually lead to them including you in future conversations. 2. Remember that high school cliques and groups constantly change. I didn’t meet my friend group until Junior year and we’re still close now so don’t think it’s too late. 3. Join in on conversations around you. Now of course don’t invade in a private conversation but if people around you are talking about something your interested in, current events, sports, anything that you have an opinion about you should include yourself. The key with high school is to just remain open to new people and experiences. A lot of students are feeling the same way you do so by making it easier for them your making it easier for yourself in the long run. Hope it goes well!

"What I hate the most about my social anxiety is the nervous feeling in my stomach that ruins my whole day if I pay too much attention to it. I recently found out that the feeling is caused by a response from the brain activating the flight or fight response (or freeze). Your body will go in stress mode and pumps more blood to the heart, brain and muscles and less to the stomach which leads to this feeling. 

Knowing this already helps me but there are periods when I have this feeling for weeks and usually before a stressful meeting/presentation. I usually meditate and tell myself that the feeling is caused by my brain and that I have nothing to worry about. I really try to just sith with it and accept that it is there. It helps a bit but the best solution is having that meeting.

Does anyone have other tips to deal with this physical symptom?

Keep up with the meditation! Roughly 90% of serotonin is produced in the gut, which is the chemical responsible for long term satisfaction. Meditation helps to boost serotonin and boosts in serotonin help boost mood. You mentioned that paying attention to it makes the feeling more uncomfortable, so it could also be helpful to practice mindfulness alongside your meditation practice-- go for a mindfulness meditation or a breath meditation rather than a body scan meditation.

"That's your perspective man. 
It's not entirely true.
You said that you have a lot to offer, let that spirit remain in you!

It's okay if you don't find yourself attractive and annoying because these are very subject terms. Something that you find unattractive might be the most beautiful thing for someone else. 
I m also a very awkward and anxious person. So I get where you're coming from. it feels that people are judging you all the time for your behaviour and almost hating you for it. But that's so not true and you will never realise that unless you communicate with people. And not all people are as bad as they wud seem.

Also, you just suspected that you have BPD. Have you even consulted an actual doc for the same? You're just assuming things and it's not what you think it is all the time. 
When people date each other, it is important to understand each other's differences and the ones who truly love you will!
People in a relationship co-exist. They accept each other the way they are. 
And honestly if a person asks you to change yourself for who you really are they don't even deserve you in the first place. 
Yeah, as people in a relationship co-exist it's important to adjust to each other's likes and dislikes but entirely as a person? Never. 
So be yourself and love yourself for the way you are and try to become a better version of yourself every day!

Now mention some positives about yourself.
Even if slightly positive, mention it.

Or better yet if you can't do that, you know what you feel your issues, your struggles are.

You think you're unattractive and annoying and awkward.

How can you fix that? Try thinking of them one at a time.

How can you fix your ""unattractiveness"". Are you really unattractive or do you simply feel that way because you resent yourself and if so, where does this resentment come from?

Ask yourself the questions that hurt cause you're the one who needs to hear it. If you want to change and develop, grow even somewhat, you have to change how you view yourself.

Me personally it seems like you dislike yourself. Who you are. Which is understandable because most of us here do, I included. But most consider their social anxiety as apart of them. So by extension, if they dislike their social anxiety they inadvertently dislike themselves as well. 

You're not your anxiety. Without your anxiety, who do you see yourself as? That individual is what you need to envision, and think. What would they do? What would they say to these things? And then do as they do, because that person is you.

Sorry I'm rambling, the main message is this.

Stop loathing yourself so much and confront what it is that makes you feel how you do about yourself. Your anxiety is not you, nor is it apart of you.

The person you wish to be and the person you currently are are the same individual. The only difference is one of them must be let go in order for the other to be embraced, and in order for you to let go of that other guy is to start giving the other one your attention which rough translation, prioritize yourself and what you want. Your true feelings, your goal of who you wish to be.Then you can become that.

"I'm glad my words have helped.

If you would like more help, I suggest you read a book.

The book specifically is The Power of Awareness, by Neville Goddard.

That will help you understand what I mean a lot more about envisioning the life you want for yourself.

Your reality is your reality, what you make of it.

If you want a better reality it all starts in the mind.
So with that in mind, wouldn't envisioning a better reality improve the one you currently exist in?
I know it may seem like I'm just talking a bunch of fake mess, but it's similar to when people say don't go thinking negative things, or think positive thoughts. Usually your day goes better,even if a little when you do that right?

It's because of the energy you're putting out and searching to find is now finding you.
That better person you want to be is always there, and it's searching for you as you are looking for it. And how do two people who don't know where the other is find each other? By grabbing their attention. Calling out to them. 

I'm barely a ways into my journey of embracing who I want to be, but this is so far what I've gotten from it.

If I want to be the individual I would like to, all I have to do is align my mind and body with that individual. I am that individual. The only difference between me and a better self is environment. Mindset.
If I can dream, I can change my present.
 But dreams will remain dreams if I do not seek further than that."	Honest-Cellist-6455	reply	na	na	na	0.9967346787452698	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety

I've heard of Neville Goddard :) from what I know he wrote about what we nowadays call manifestation? I think yes there is truth to that, some people misunderstand it and think it's all thought and no action, and I have been skeptical about it but yes visualising does help, even imagining how you'd feel if what you aim for has already happened... I will add that book to my to read list. Thank you 🙏	Honest-Cellist-6455	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9967346787452698	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

Sometimes just putting periods at the end of my sentences makes me feel like I'm being rude.

I'm trying to care less. People might be offended but they will move on. I think a lot of people come across as rude when they don't mean to be. I'm currently working a contract job for a few months. There's this man who works for another division. I was introduced to him when I started and sometimes when I see him in the lunch area I will say hi. Yesterday as I was walking upstairs to the lunch area he was walking towards it as well but a bit of a distance away. I saw him when I turned my head but kept on walking and quickly went up the stairs. I have sleep issues and my head tend to be foggy and sometimes I'm quite loopy. I think he thinks I hate him. Because later on in the day when I went to get water in the downstairs lunch area he was there with two of my colleagues. When my colleague asked me if I had lunch I responded normally and confidently. I think he scoffed, because of how I reacted to him and how different I was with my colleague.	rainbowtoucan1992	reply	na	na	na	0.9994432330131531	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"True, but the OP could be perceived as rude from another perspective.  I actually find that if I push myself a bit and explain myself more I generally get a better reaction, as people have less chance to misinterpret my intentions. Easier said than done thoug.

However, sometimes it turns out I was unconsciously rude. No one is perfect, so I just try to accept that that may happen and learn from it.

I still struggle with it nowadays, too. I don't wanna be rude, but I just feel so weird and awkward looking people in the eye for (seemingly) too long.

(Male) I feel so fucked up, people dislike the look on my face and always get repulsed by my natural face, always judging, laughing and disrespecting the way I look, I struggle to land good jobs through interviews, forget making friends let alone relationships, I feel so downgraded in my life so much pain that it's torture to leave the house anywhere I go I get challenged, laughed at and mocked. I'm fucking sick of it i dont feel human anymore every interaction I have leads with the utmost negative reaction towards me. I have been respectful to everyone, tried smiling improving myself physically and mentally but nothing works. People mean mug me when I smile in public. It's like I ain't allowed to exist or be happy. And on top of all this I struggle with social anxiety symptoms because of this daily trauma I'm thinking of checking out of life. My friends that I had were fake behind my back so I cut them out so I have no one to turn to. I don't know what to do anymore. I am 22 and feel like everything is against me. I am sick of walking in public places and people start mean mugging and being repulsed by me when I don't make a slight interaction with them.

People are like rare gems, it's hard to find someone that is worth it and it's mostly up to luck. You can spend years looking and not finding a friend and then one day you just bump into your future best friend.

Please hang on and try be open about other people, even if most people you meet are going to be rude to you, there are people that won't.

You just have to try and find ways to make it easier to meet those people, like going to events of things you like or trying to talk to people online.

Specially now that we are older, talking to new people can be pretty tough, we all have our own things going on our own lives, so please don't be too hard on yourself when you or someone else doesn't give the best first impression, and keep trying."

Lol, I belly laughed at the thought of having to chew gum 24/7 just to get through the day.

"Ok so I’m going to preface this by saying when I tell people I have social anxiety everyone is stunned because I’ve been told I come across as very outgoing and confident, and this honestly couldn’t be further from the truth.

The thing is I’ve had social anxiety since I was a child, and I think I have got so used to using avoidance of things I’m anxious about. I remember all through Secondary school I skipped lunch because that would require me having to go to the school canteen and that was a huge no for my anxiety.

I’m rapidly approaching 29 and I’m starting to realise how much avoidance has played in  Examples of this would be I have never dated or been in a relationship, as someone who is hyper self critical rejection is the worst feeling in the world because I always try to find fault in myself. 

Another example, is I live in a flat and we have communal bins, and I went through a long period of not taking the rubbish down because of the potential of having an unplanned social interaction. 

To avoid this turning into a list lol, there are many other examples but I hope this is sufficient to give y’all an idea,

Has anyone gone through similar experiences and managed to come out the other side?? I’m stuck on what to do and know that If I don’t at least find a way to manage this, it’s gonna to be hugely detrimental to my life .

It sounds like you're describing anxiety with a shame component. Symptomatically, anxiety and shame are nearly identical-- feeling not good enough, embarrassed, worried, and discomfort which results in avoidance. A deep sense of shame can sometimes get mislabelled as social anxiety too. Shame, at its core, is a fear of rejection. It's often referred to as the poison fruit emotion because of how uncomfortable it makes us feel; one taste and we never want to feel it again. It might be helpful to look into the shame aspect.

"I've read that active listening is a good way to help more comfortable in social situations. It's also sort of a necessary skill for my career field (medicine) which I want to get better for the sake of my future patients. 

I've been told I'm a good listener, but I feel that it's because I use some basic ""tricks"" like nodding my head, rephrasing their comments, etc.. However, in my head I'm panicking about *what the hell am I going to say next?!, when should I start speaking, how do I make sure they think I'm listening and care what they say?, how do I not look stupid?""*

"As a late bloomer in life I can confidently say life is a journey that will continue to surprise you no matter how old you are. 

If you smile and nod at people or add a simple ""Good morning (afternoon)"" or ""How are you?"" it can make all the difference. Even if you technically aren't saying this to initiate a conversation you're making the environment more inviting and hospitable to others.   


Confidence comes from repetition, this is especially true of social anxiety. Whether I made a fool of myself or made someone feel more welcome, the experiences I gained helped build my confidence. I used to have panic attacks every time I had to socialize and now I don't bat an eye at socializing. I even do public speaking!   


Start small and focus on how you want to be perceived. Do you want to be the friendly welcoming presence in the office or something else? Start observing people who exhibit the traits you want to build for yourself and add those behaviors into your own day.

Working with social anxiety is really hard. Although I don't agree that you should have to smile and nod at people you don't know, that is the expectation in most working environments. Most working environments want extroverted, social people. When you're not, it can cause a lot of problems, like big problems. What has been really  bad in my experience is the extroverts don't have to say hi because everyone likes them and feels a way about them. If they know you are more introverted, awkward, they come down on you for not saying hi. Again, I don't agree with this at all. Work places often talk about diversity, but they only mean the color of someone's skin and nothing else. I mean that literally. There is so much more that goes into that including personality. Until the working world realizes that, smile and nod. Remote work may also be a good idea. Less socializing.	Honest-Cellist-6455	reply	na	na	na	0.9981203675270081	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
I used to feel the need to smile and nod at EVERYONEEE. Just became a weird habit. I’m finally learning to pretend people don’t exist at all, it’s quite empowering.

Sometimes I got told rules explicitly, but generally people don't pull me aside to tell me them - they usually expect me to just know them. So, I've resorted to observation (eg how does a conversation in a group flow?), careful listening (what behaviours do people complain about others doing?), and reflecting (if someone did that to me, how would I feel?) to try to figure out what people expect.

There's a paradox with anxiety. The more you resist it the worse it gets sometimes? So it's important to ACCEPT that yes, you will get nervous and anxious, just go into situations while knowing you will be nervous and when it comes up don't fight it...like don't go ""oh god it's happening, what should i do?"" Treat it more like, ""oop. Yes, as expected."" Give it some attention, acknowledge it, like a panicked friend who's panicking for nothing, acknowledge it but say, we're going to do this even though we feel anxious, then paradoxically when you accept it the anxiety lessens."

"I dont really understand when the shift happened.  
  
When I was young I was super loud, talkative, hyper, had los of friends and acquaintances.  
  
In highschool I had a decent group of friends but wasn't a popular kid. I felt like I wasn't cool enough to fit in with them.  
  
During college I was super reserved and only talked to like1 or 2 friends.  
  
After graduating I became a hermit. The covid hit, even more isolation…  
  
I recently got a job and the people are really nice. There are a few that dont care for me but MOST of them are super nice and reach out to talk to me.  
  
I dont know why I forced myself to believe that I'm this like stain that deserves to be avoided at all cost.  
  
People dont seem to hate me or be disgusted by me. Im getting praise for my work, Im always improving, and even getting offered promotions.  
  
Theres like 3 types of interactions. The people that obviously dont care much for me, the people that are just being decent humans, and those few that actually seem somewhat drawn to me and go out of their way to talk or interact with me.  
  
I know im being almost rude by isolating myself from those that reach out to me but I cant help it. I simply cannot accept that there are people that naturally like me. I feel like im just waiting for the moment they finally stop reaching out to me because I cant accept them.  
  
I hate that I feel this way.  
  
I dont know when this shift happened in my life.  
  
Like I said at the start, I was a rowdy ass kid growing up. My mom keeps saying she remembers how I was the loudest kid at the playground, funny enough my dad says HIS dad told him the same thing growing up. Right now my dad is more or less the same as before. Super hyper and talkative.  
  
He did have a shy phase in his teen years but somehow beat it. Hes back to being super chatty and energetic and borderline annoying.  
I cant seem to beat this tho.  
  
Im always depressed, always anxious, always scanning peoples reactions to me, always doubting myself, always overthinking peoples interactions with me.

"My job doesn’t requiere me to speak to anyone unless there’s a emergency. However I’m expected to at least check in with the store manager so they know I’m here which triggers my anxiety for me. 

Almost everyday it is extremely difficult for me to even say good morning, so when I see coworkers walking towards me I avert eye contact and pretend that I don’t notice them even if they are right in front of me and it’s impossible to miss them which I know can come off as super cold and awkward. I also leave on my break without letting the manager know which is a no no and when it’s time to shutdown I just leave without saying goodbye even if I’m expected to notify the manager I’m leaving.

There was a case happened recently where I was expected to let the manager know I’m leaving so they could lock up behind me but I was so nervous that I just left and hoped they figured out the door was still unlocked, which obviously could’ve led the store being robbed, but it’s a example of how difficult it is for me sometimes to even speak up.

"You could try hand gestures instead? Obviously, there's the stress of explaining your idea - you could do that on a paper note. But it'd be sort of like sign language - certain hand gestures refer to specific questions. That way, you're still communicating, but you don't actually have to talk.

Ex. Tapping on your manager's shoulder to get their attention, then pointing and looking toward an exit with a questioning look to indicate you want to know if it's okay for you to leave- for break, for end of shift, etc.

As for greeting your coworkers, could you maybe look in their general direction and just smile and wave? Or just wave/just smile? That way, you're still acknowledging them, and it doesn't cause you the stress of eye contact and a verbal greeting.

Basically, you'd focus on nonverbal communication to start with. You could move up to one-word sentences once you could manage your anxiety with looks and hand gestures, and then full (but short) sentences."	Interesting_Cat6184	reply	na	na	na	0.9990756511688232	no	no	strong	na	socialanxiety

If it's awkward, so what, better than not saying anything (in this circumstance).

"I let my social anxiety control me for so long. I avoided normal jobs, I even went so far as to avoid my dream job. The second I felt like I didn't want to go that dream path I told myself ""become an influencer, you can work from home"".   


I recently have been wanting to follow my dream career again. So I went to a subreddit on this app and asked a question which ultimately led me to realize that I need to follow my heart and I found out that becoming an influencer could seriously harm the goals I have for the career I want.  I need to go for the career I want.   


Which means also overcoming the obstacles I need to. Right now, I'm looking for a ""normal"" job so that I can afford lessons in what I want to do. I can't help but feel that I wasted a year or two but at the same time maybe it was time I needed to take.

"I'm about to post another rant in r/fitness but i think twice about it. I had been posting about getting annoyed at people talking to me at the gym quite often. But after giving it a few thoughts, maybe they are not the problem, maybe I am. 

I'm just really bad at handling any conversation. My brain overclocks and immediately assume the other person is making fun of me. It runs a lots of scenario, trying to read what the other person is thinking. It even tries to interpret every word that comes of their mouth and put dozens of meanings. Dwelling particularly more on negative ones. I get so insecure and i lose my words. I either stutter or croak and turn it into an awkward and embarassing situtation that I'll eventually add to the pile of never-do-it-again that my brain likes to playsback over and over whenever I'm alone in my thoughts. It keeps me up at night.

So whenever someone tries to talk to me, I keep my words to a minimum and answer with gestures instead like nodding or shaking my head. 

Anyway, there was a guy at the gym who likes talking to me while I'm doing my workout and giving out advice. I try to keep my interaction to a minimum praying he just leave me alone. But he likes to stand by and watch. Sometimes even cheer. It always makes me so anxious I almost lose focus and injure myself. So I just keep away to avoid him. 

Today, he tried again to be friendly but I was on my last few set, tired and just not in the mood to entertain. So I just completely ignored him by pretending I'm too engrossed in my music, even though I could definitely hear him thru my headset. Does not seem to bother him at all and just keep on talking to me, one-sidedly, even trying to catch my gaze on my reflection in the mirror. I turned my head away but he's still talking, so I just left to use a different machine. 

It felt so rude, I hated myself. So I tried to watch him secretly from afar just to see if my behavior upset him. But he just went talking to some other guy like nothing happened and they just talk for a while like normal people do. 

I hated myself. I don't even have to approach people. Random stranger on the street, my neighbors, or anyone else often try to talk to me or break the ice. They were the ones approaching me, I don't even need to start the conversation. Yet I can't reciprocate the kind gesture or even be polite about it.

"I’m from a culture where small talk isn’t really a thing and when I first got expose to it on a daily basis, it was rough. Was also annoyed and nervous and didn’t know how to respond. It will take a long time to get used to so take your time.

If you still feel awful about it, you can always bring it up with him the next time when you are ready and in the mood to talk. He will appreciate it, I’m sure. He sounds like a really nice gym bro! 

Socializing shouldn’t be a chore, talk when you feel like it. If you don’t, people will know it’s not the right time and talk to you some other time. Also, some people just like to talk without needing much responses XD"	rednryt	reply	na	na	na	0.9991281628608704	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
You absolutely should not feel bad about this. Like at all. You are at the gym for yourself. Not to make friends with the other gym-goers. It’s “me-time” and sacred. This guy is not picking up the signals that you’re laying down it seems, which are messages saying, “leave me alone” “I’m not interested in conversation.” This is serious, your loss of focus could result in injury and then you’d really be hating yourself.

This used to happen to me a lot, when I was at school I would ignore whenever someone spoke to me or simply respond short, it was a way to avoid when someone was rude to me, which happened a lot because of my bad appearance.

"I have zero friends or even acquaintances. Due to other types of anxiety and OCD, I don’t really get out of the house for anything other than medical appointments. I’m very isolated and lonely and have been long before Covid even happened.

I’ve heard many other people talk about how socializing on the internet(Forums, Reddit, Facebook, etc.) is easier for them. But for me, in person and online socializing is just as difficult.

I also have very noticeable Autism, so I literally don’t understand the process of making a friend(online or otherwise). To me, trying to make a friend, feels like I have to do complex math that I never learned, while someone is berating me while I fail.

I have always been a lurker. How do I break this pattern? If I’m ever to get decent at in person socializing I need to at least learn to do it online."	PoolLongjumping9562	post	19.98661952376007	male	White	0.9987554550170898	na	na	na	4	socialanxiety
My anxiety about socializing on the Internet is actually worse that socializing IRL. I think it stems from the fact that when I speak to someone face to face I get instant feedback and have more control over how I will be received.  But online all you can use is words so the side of nonverbal communication such as tone of voice, facial expressions,  etc. is completely lost, which means I can't read other people very well and I worry that without those cues they might misinterpret what I'm saying.

Keep practicing whatever you do and don’t give up on it. I don’t have autism so I can’t give you advice on that side, but finding friends is extremely important. I’m sure it’s frustrating right now but if you can just keep practicing you will find someone or even a group of people you fit in with. I find talking one on one with someone online to be a difficult as well as it’s hard to get a full understanding of the other person. I suggest group chats or in person conversations, even simple greetings at the store asking the cashier how their day is good practice.

"Did possibly the most counter-intuitive thing: took a step back from a friendship.

Because of some interactions, I thought the friendship was strong and meaningful to both of us. Slowly it started to become clear how my anxiety and those interactions had made me put more importance into the person+friendship than I should have. We weren't on the same page. 

It was causing me to feel hurt, more anxious, confused, envious, and overall it led to increased feelings of attachment and dependency.

At this point, it seemed like the therapy was just emotional support instead of CBT, but a lot of times the topics I brought up could be linked back to my social anxiety issues and cognitive distortions.

hi I just graduated few weeks ago from college and now I'm unemployed. I am pressured and anxious to apply because i don't know what will happen during the job interview. I feel sick whenever I think about me being interviewed with a random stranger to check my abilities and speaking skills. I know I will stutter and worst will be mental block so I am a bit hesitant to make a first move in applying. I know some might feel the same, it's not easy but I really want to try. :(( I'm so anxious what should I do???	_emptycan	post	19.104541054347404	female	White	0.9715577960014343	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety
i know how you feel im 20 worked several jobs lots of interviews, it gets better as time goes on. your basically repeating the same thing you wrote in ur cv so like ur hobbies interests, why you want the job and your availability. ive only failed one interview out of the 6 jobs ive worked at but it just doesnt help that i end up getting fired or just quitting when it all wears off and everyone is quickly sick of me as they figure out how weird i am	_emptycan	reply	na	na	na	0.9715577960014343	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"In a coupleof days, im going to start my new school year and i'm so anxious and stressed. it doesnt help for the past 3 years I have been learning online and ive been constantly cooped up at home except for a few family gatherings, going to the mall and vacations etc. I have no friends and I don't even have a relationship with any of my relatives. the only person i can comfortably speak to is my brother. For the past 1-2 months of summer break, i had been incessantly anxious about going back to  onsite school. Im so afraid of embarrassing myself, being scrutinized and i dont think i can do it idk i just want to become numb to all this anxiety and not be in constant misery anymore. I cant see anything good about going back to onsite school. i feel like all my bad memories in my various school years pre pandemic has come to haunt me  saying all of this and more will happen to you. I am so tired, i dont know if i can do this but i know i have to and i will. its not i can say this to my parents  hoping theyll understand me  help me on this (well, i can buti know them, ive been this this situation before, they dont understand me.)

&#x200B;

Anyways since going to school is inevitable, ill probably have to face the dreadful introduce yourself to the class experience. I was wondering what is the most boring thing i can say that will not give me any attention. I would like it to be vague and you cant really say much to it and it just fades in the background. i always used ""Hi my name is Silje and I like drawing"" (bc lots of children my age that time always also used that intro & saying my actual hobbies/something about myself makes me feel conceited) but bc of personal reasons i dont like that introduction anymore. any suggestion is appreciated! :) "	Siljeeee	post	19.158570930983004	male	White	0.9985260963439941	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety
Hey just wanted to say back to school nerves, especially a new school, is completely normal. Online school the past 3 years really screwed me over too so I know how you feel but trust me in person is so much better. The first few days will be the hardest part so just get through them. This might be challenge but I suggest you talk to the people you sit with in each class just to get the ball rolling on people recognizing you and making potential friends. Either introduce yourself, make a joke or comment about the class, or even ask someone for a pencil. Just make sure to get that practice in and have the people around you be aware of you because that will help spark more conversations in the future. Anyways good luck you got this!

"> Literally one of my dreams as a kid was to be able to walk up to strangers & start a conversation with 0 anxiety or hesitation. 

Can relate, I too envy people who can easily approach and talk to anyone ever since I was a kid. 

But sadly, I just got even worse as an adult. At least when I was younger I can force myself to try to talk to my peers due to some school activity or work stuff. 

Nowadays that i don't have any excuse to talk to people I don't even bother anymore. Worst, I often find myself in situations where I avoid anyone who try to talk to me. And I just hate myself more."	rosegold___21	reply	na	na	na	0.002060123486444354	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
It was four apprentices and my boss, we were all taking turns practicing selling a product and on my turn I (physically) could not get a word out. Felt like I was going to contort into my body until I disappeared, and on top of that, I was so embarrassed that I was throwing such a tantrum over it!!! After contorcing for a while and being increasingly and visibly more uncomfortable, my boss was pretty understanding but at that point I was pretty much already crying.

I had an interview today for a position in what is pretty much my dream job. I somehow managed to score an internship prior to this, so I have been already working at this institution for the last 3 months. They told me to apply, but in my mind I know how competitive this position is and during my interview this knowledge made me so incredibly nervous and I rushed through my answers. I feel like I’m even more embarrassed because I know and really like all of the people that were interviewing me, and I’m worried I came across like a bumbling anxious idiot and I messed up a chance I’m probably not going to get again.

"Whomever (friends/family) I meet has this question: do you know bike riding/car driving? I'm just not that much into them, unless it's an emergency. But I just nod or respond with a simple 'yes', to avoid unnecessary follow-up questions. But they come up with follow-up questions like 'how far you have ridden/driven', 'how do you commute to office' etc., which is none of their business. People just put you down and make you feel bad as if you are unfit for life, if you unknowingly say you don't know/are not much interested in driving/riding or don't go long rides/drives. 

Why are these shitty people so much obsessed with this bike/car thing? And this question often comes to me and not others. Is it a crime to simply use taxi/public transport? Or is being nerdish and confident in career and money brings such questions? Or are people insecure about your success in your niche? Or is being an introvert brings up such questions? Sometimes I go to the extent of totally avoiding socialization with people, just to avoid such questions.

I guess you wait until something you can relate to/can talk about is brought up and enter the conversation from there. Idk I've been trying to do this as a part of exposure therapy and I've gotten mixed results. Sometimes I'm outright ignored and other times people respond normally and I feel more included in the conversation. Part of it depends on how you present yourself and the people you're with, though it's hard to tell which factors are at play (some people are mean, others will try to include you even if you look like you're shitting bricks). So if your attempt goes awry, recognize that it may not be because you're creepy or awkward but because you don't fit in with that particular group.

Hi!! I have a question about anxiety that I'd really like to get a therapists opinion on. Is this a commonly known phenomenon and does it have a name: I personally realized my anxiety was coming from judging myself too harshly after any social interactions. I didn't know exactly how I should behave, so I was easily able to nitpick every little thing I did. Over time, I developed an association between socializing and torturing myself afterwords (no wonder I got anxiety). I'm fascinated by this because my wife has absolutely zero social anxiety and it's a bizarre concept for her. After a social interaction, she would only judge her behavior based on pretty forgiving standards like 'was I rude', and I think this might be a key factor for social anxiety. She never seems to judge herself on standards like 'was I in confident, was I funny, was I cool, was I smooth and clever' ect.	strawbreekay	reply	na	na	na	0.0018986525246873498	weak	strong	strong	na	socialanxiety
"Hey there. Not a therapist yet, but I'm on training. Actually, I was diagnosed AvPD after being on social anxiety treatment for a year. Some times it still escapes my control and I spiral in sadness and loneliness. It's hard... I don't feel confident at all for many reasons. We all know there's always a way out and we also know what's like being hopeless. It's freacking hard and painful. Seems like it never will end, but there's always an end. 

I'm actually in a very vulnerable situation, dealing with a long recidive crisis of depression. Sometimes I feel ashamed to be so fragile for a caretaker and lost my confidence even more.

I work as a front end cashier at my local store. Most of the times, it’s a back of forth game of being fine and on the edge of crying. I usually overthink smalls things like whether or not, a customer likes me based on their tone and forgetting to say hello because I’m afraid the other person doesn’t want me to. Basically, making my own assumptions giving into my social anxiety. Even though I’ve been doing this for months, I still have issues with it. Today was a really bad day. Im being told I have to advertise to customers about donating to a local charity. I felt like crying tbh. I have trouble even starting and finishing conversations customers start with me. How can I even ask customers to donate when I can barely say hello and make eye contact? I’ve been getting at it sure, but I feel like the customers will hate me for asking them to donate. Small struggles like this always happen but this recent one is the worst I’ve encountered. Any tips on going about my recent situation? What can I do to make sure I don’t start crying at work thinking about asking people to do that?	Zimzalabimcult	post	23.985422088048253	female	White	0.9994773268699646	na	na	na	3	socialanxiety
"Alright, i think you can start a ""script"" about the donations whenever someone comes to pay their products. 

If the person looks like they are in a rush, just do your thing, but if they are not, give a brief explanation about the charity while handling the money. Something like ""Hey, that place is having a charity, would you mind donating or sharing the message with a friend?"".

Something short that you can repeat with every client won't be as heavy for you and you'll still get the job done. Just don't forget that a ""No"" means no and you shouldn't force anything past a no."	Zimzalabimcult	reply	na	na	na	0.9994773268699646	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"Don't pay attention to the quota, you don't need that extra pressure. Just try and focus on getting the script going. More people are willing to donate than you'd expect and those who don't, usually will just refuse and not bother much.

If someone asks why are you asking for donations, then just tell them about what the donations are for. After that they will accept or refuse and that's it.

Just try and avoid the whole deal if you see someone rushing through their shopping list.

So today at work I went to the restroom and it was being cleaned by the housekeeping staff. So, me being the idiot I am, I stood there and waited like five minutes while they finished up cleaning. I’m a male and the housekeepers were female so I didn’t feel comfortable going in with them in there and didn’t want to make them feel uncomfortable either. When they were walking out they gave me weird looks. I went in, did my business and as I was leaving it dawned on me. I should’ve just went to another bathroom. (There’s multiple as I work in a large factory) Now I keep asking myself why I wasn’t smart enough to automatically think to go find another bathroom that wasn’t being cleaned. I probably made them uncomfortable anyways because I stood and waited.	ExistingAlbatross32	post	21.034858303570015	female	White	0.9994706511497498	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety

I really want to be alone. I feel like I can't even try something new in my own house because I am so afraid of my family judging me. What if I do it wrong and they see? I want the whole world to disappear. I want to be alone and to try everything without feeling this fear.
I really want to try and have more confidence. I want to motivate myself and become better and learn how to love and accept myself. Everything was going so great... Today, I saw my old friends' account. They are having fun. They are having so much fun with their new friends, in their new school. I am here. In my room. Crying. I skipped school for a whole year. The only 3 days I assisted I hid in the bathroom for hours. I want to cry. I can't believe it. They all look so good, so pretty, so confident. I don't feel like that. I don't feel I can do this. I don't want to go back to school and see all of those good-looking students. I am so damn scared. And it hurts how no one seems to understand or to at least try. My family keeps repeating, ""Just go and talk, is not that hard."" I can't. I feel like I'm broken. Why can't I be like the others? Why are other kids my age able to walk into the classroom? I can't. I couldn't. I had to spend the whole day in the bathroom while having panic attacks, thinking about what would I say if I got caught. 

I know this frustrates my mom so much. We have argued so much because of me and this anxiety. I really feel horrible.

I had to stop seeing my psychologist because I felt too anxious. I haven't taken my antidepressants in weeks.

I'm really tired of feeling so scared of doing anything around people. I want to be alone. I'd do so many things if I could be totally alone. Just me. I could learn so many things without being afraid of others. I really want this to end.

this has been brought up on this sub before but i just wanted to vent. after therapy i feel like shit. its funny how im doing the very things my therapist tells me to stop doing (ex: ruminating). but i cant because im so accustomed to ruminating and a simple breathing technique won’t help. i keep going over everything she and i said. I told her how im anxious about how no college will accept me with low tier extracurriculars and I told her my dream schools since she asked.  And basically she replied “well *insert school* accepted me and i wasn’t a very good student at that point. WHICH MADE ME internalize this interaction such as her saying “oh you are not getting into those schools sweety 🫣💀” i know shes trying to help and its just my mental illness fueling these thoughts but 👁️💋👁️. I feel like non socially anxious people will never understand because I told her how I feel very stupid and different from other people since I cant articulate a sentence without scripting what I am going to say beforehand and if i dont script ill pause during the interaction or my mind goes blank. She asked for a example of this occuring, i said “when ordering food” and she replied oh i do that too. It makes me feel invalidated like..I cant stop ruminating …….idk whether to bring this up in the next therapy session because i dont want to make her feel bad	wurtheringheight	post	14.212943932940922	male	White	0.9994730353355408	na	na	na	3	socialanxiety

Well this was actually the first session and i feel like this sort of way with every therapist i’ve ever been put with so i’ve just grown accustomed to this feeling. This is actually a form of therapy my school offers, where they give you free 5 sessions then give you resources to send you off to more liscensed practioners for long term therapy. So I’ll just wait these 5 free sessions out and see🫶🏻. Tysm though	wurtheringheight	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9994730353355408	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"I have agoraphobia because of my social anxiety. I'm F24, unemployed, no friends and I'm at home 24/7 because I literally have no reason to go out. I haven't left my home in 2 weeks now and I feel so guilty.

Yk, I have this side of me, that has the urge to be productive, go out, have fun etc. but my agoraphobia and depression is so bad, I just can't do any of this. So the guilt starts to get insaneeee. I feel like I'm totally wasting my life but there's nothing I can do about it. It's a really hard situation to deal with.

I basically rot in my room, have pain from laying around all day, binge eat, binge watch netflix, watch other people on social media having their best life and cry, cry, cry and cry.

I'm always like: tomorrow will be different, I will face my fears, go out at least to get some groceries. But I fail again. I maybe manage to have 1-2 productive days, and then I'm so knocked out, I lock myself in my room again.

Whatever you do you cannot let that voice telling you to do more die out. It sounds like you have trouble with building momentum day to day, which I do as well but the best advice I can give is to acknowledge and reward that part of you that wants to do more. Start with baby steps like going to the grocery store, looking online for jobs, or whatever you want those steps to be as long as it’s you pushing that boundary. Or if you want to keep your love for Netflix alive go to a gym and watch Netflix on the treadmill or while you work that way you can still have that while also being productive. Just know it is possible and you are capable of great things you just need to give yourself the chance	saracnsss	reply	na	na	na	0.9984843134880066	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety
Life is not wasted if you are happy. Maybe you could find some hobbies that help you focus yourself on yourself, like an art or skill.

Im so sorry you are experiencing this. Do you have family that you trust to help you with this? I think you should pray and ask God to help you. He did me, in so many ways. Btw try not to beat yourself up too much, sometimes our bodies really do need the rest. Try going outside if you can, can you take walks at all? Where do you feel the most peace? Since your situation is making you feel shame and so sad is there anyway possible you can do something to make you happy even for a moment then keep adding those things that make you happy every single day? I know how you feel btw it was very hard for me at one point to drive anywhere. It will get easier and better.

Accurate. My therapist actually told me that fear of judgement is a foundational component of SAD. We develop this fear in different ways, during childhood development or traumatic incidents, etc, but our fear of social situations is about how we feel we will be treated and perceived when interacting with others. Knowing this really helps me be more confident in certain situations because I can quickly assess when I should care  what someone thinks and my fear has some validity (and how much, ex. work events vs friend/family gatherings) and when I can be myself and not care at all because my fear isn't rational ex. concerts.	davididp	reply	na	na	na	0.9991635084152222	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

they put me on edge, they are always annoyed, upset, and angry, with every day tasks like driving, minimum wage workers, and overall minor inconveniences that could be solved if they put a little more thought into what they do. they get upset or say something that upsets me for what feels like every hour and im around for it all.

they discourage and mock me. my dad gaslights me and is deffinently a narcissist. my mom acts brain dead, trusts only her own opinion, and comments on my insecurities (even though i told her what she does and to stop) and is inconsiderate of the people around her. they both act like children 

ive been reacting more to how they react, but i still do try my best to contain myself and not to take advantage of them for what good they do for me because they deffinently do alot of good for me but i have built alot of discontempt for them over the things i have explained and have gained little to no tolerance for them even though im not allowed to show the full extent of how i feel. i know they have good hearts (kindof) but the way I have been treated is unexceptable and i have gained alot of issues from what i belive to be them. im very upset."	tirewaist	post	25.90337078184069	male	White	0.9993869066238403	na	na	na	3	socialanxiety

Glad to hear you have a sense of humor about it but to be honest it is going to come back. It’s not going to be as bad as it was at your worst I promise you that, but you will be challenged with that feeling of hiding away and not talking to anyone again. The key is to refuse it and fight it. The great thing about your situation is you already have that momentum going and are doing great so it won’t be as easy to fall into it.

"I completely resonate with your feelings! I used to grapple with the exact same struggle. There were times when anxiety seemed absent, but then a nagging thought would creep in: ""What if anxiety returns and this good feeling vanishes?"" It led to anxiety about anxiety, quite the ironic loop.

The monumental shift for me occurred when I started embracing the present moment. I understand it's a common piece of advice, easier said than done, yet when those negative thoughts arise, making an effort to dismiss and release them has been a game-changer.

Interestingly, the paradox lies in trying to disregard anxiety, as the act itself reminds you of it, fueling more unease. Rather, focusing on positive thoughts can truly redirect your mindset. For instance, relishing being alive for a new day or savoring the beautiful weather can push the negativity aside.

Over time, reshaping your thought patterns gradually diminishes room for negativity. It's like retraining your mind to not lean into those detrimental paths.

I'm 14, and I can't believe how much my social anxiety has increased lately, especially now that I'm in high school. I don't even know why it's happening. For example, I struggle to talk to anyone, even kids I've known for years. I have to mentally prepare myself just to ask a teacher for help. I don't have any friends, even though I could easily make them. All the students and teachers at my school are friendly and laid-back. It's even more challenging for me because I'm a big guy, standing at 5'11. Having social anxiety really affects my self-image. Honestly, I want to make friends. I want to feel comfortable during class projects and not be lonely. But no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to overcome it. Everyone around me dismisses it as just a part of my personality, but deep down, I'm suffering from this loneliness. Asking for help only adds to my anxiety, and right now, I'm starting to despise myself for being so fearful. All I want is to have at least one friend, but that hope is slowly fading away. 	bobmynameisbobim68	post	18.01480666410181	female	White	0.9986684322357178	na	na	na	16	socialanxiety
I can understand what you are going through rn. I also had SA for most of my school life and I know how it ruins the best phase of your life. But remember one thing that you are not alone, many people feel the way you feel. And there is no reason to hate yourself for it. Most probably it's not even your fault you feel this way. Just try and talk to people and find common interests to make friends. Once you do that you will become desensitised to the extreme horror you feel now.

"It is so hard. Do you have anyone you might trust to tell you are struggling with this and get some help? A parent, older sibling, teacher, doctor? You are old enough now that you can talk to your doctor without your parents in the room, I would let them know you are struggling with this. I am 26 now but started struggling when I was younger than you. I wish I had asked for help at that age, because the sooner you address these things the sooner you’ll feel better. 

Also- are there any activities you could join? Joining a recurring social activity helped me make friends just out of being in repeated proximity with the same kids with similar interests. You could try looking into activities not associated with the school as well if you need a fresh start with new people.

Also look into Teen Line or other peer support lines. It could be helpful to just get some practice talking and opening up to other teens."	bobmynameisbobim68	reply	na	na	na	0.9986684322357178	weak	no	strong	na	socialanxiety

"Are you receiving help like medications, therapy and psychiatrist? If not, you should tell your parents about how much you’re struggling and how you need help. We all know that this ain’t a thing that will go away on its own. At least to most people it doesn’t go away like that. 

That is what I did. My social anxiety started when I was at the end of 6th grade, when I was 12 because of obvious traumatising reasons. Now I’m also 14, nothing has changed, but I managed to prove my parents that it’s nothing like shyness and/or a complex. Then I got signed to 2 psychologists which then sent me to a clinical psychologist which is then got me, finally, for my help - a good, experienced psychiatrist. Since my case of social anxiety is definitely a very serious one, I can tell that I went through a lot to get just a psychiatrist. I hope that you will receive your help faster than me.

"This might sound weird, but I would try using visualization to help.  You could visualize yourself doing everything you want to do, and imagine it feeling good and being easy.  In this case, just imagine yourself easily approaching people and feeling good about it, etc.  This is a powerful technique that athletes and business people do to help achieve top performance.  I use visualization sometimes before a big event or even a small social interaction to help me feel prepared and comfortable, and it is neat to see how it helps shift my internal world to align with what I want to experience.

Also, it's normal to feel afraid and it is also normal to feel like you despise yourself for those fears.   I think a lot of people go through similar feelings.  It might be helpful to really hone in on what exactly you are afraid of through some introspection.  A lot of times if I take time to understand my fears, I see how they might be trying to protect me or keep me safe, and it helps me feel more compassionate towards myself.   

I also try to just accept and go with my anxieties rather than fight against them.  For example, if approaching people is making me feel anxious, I might instead sit by myself until I feel more balanced.  Often people end up approaching me and it is less anxiety-inducing this way.

As far as loneliness goes, I have made an effort to be my own best friend and to be as kind to myself as I can.  I have had many friends come and go through life, and so it made me suffer to feel like there was no one I could completely count on to be there for me.  So I do my best to treat myself very lovingly and kindly, because ultimately friendships may not last even when they seem good.  I also think it is even possible to be surrounded by people and still feel lonely, so I figured connecting to myself might be helpful.  Being in nature also really helps me feel less lonely."	bobmynameisbobim68	reply	na	na	na	0.9986684322357178	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

I feel lonely even when I'm with people or my friends. I know they are all nice and kind hearted but I just don't have the desire or energy to live this life in a fun way. It's like I'm just alive. I miss being a kid because back then life was so full of enjoyment even over little things but now there's no interest or will. It's like I have to force myself to enjoy life in a fake way. This is different from social anxiety I can tell. I think it's depression.	bobmynameisbobim68	reply	na	na	na	0.9986684322357178	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"For context my social anxiety is strongly linked and started with me working at my current company, although we are always joking around and they say i’m very energetic i don’t actually get along so much with my colleagues, they mostly make fun of each other, make jokes or talk about partying, i am more of a deep conversation type of person which make us not vibe that much and makes me feel so alone all the time.
I am fairly funny when i’m with people from my home country for example but when it comes to work my jokes often lay flat or awkward.

Yesterday i was having bad anxiety triggered by me feeling left out at work so i spent the shift being calm and quiet but they all kept asking if i’m ok which worsened my state, i decided today to put up a front and act as energetic as they are used to while still overthinking every little thing, however at one point my colleague asked a question i answered and the exchange was a bit weird then my other colleague said “stop with your embarrassing air” i said what? and he said “you’re embarrassing/awkward” in front of 6 other colleagues, i didn’t know what to reply to that and it confirmed all of those negative thoughts i’ve been having.
This was my last straw and i got quiet after that and was so afraid to be judged that i wasn’t able to utter a word even when spoken to, then my anxiety worsened so much that i stormed out of the office and had a very bad anxiety attack that lasted for 50 minutes and only went away with medication.
i am so scared to go to work again tomorrow knowing that it isn’t just in my head, that my worst nightmare wasn’t just in my imagination.
And i also can’t believe people can say something so hurtful cause i could never do that"	learning-and-stuff	post	29.165395140549265	male	White	0.9992901086807251	na	na	na	9	socialanxiety

I think it’s a lot about accepting that we might be judged by some people indeed. But I think there’s always those people who will find us endearing or even ‘cool’ despite our ‘awkwardness.’

Great to hear that you’re feeling more confident! I think it’s a combination of trying to do the things you fear and also trying to accept yourself.

Right! I agree… and oftentimes the people who judge us are left with nothing to say eventually or are even flabbergasted when they realize that we are actually a good person, or smart, or even cool. I feel like it can turn around, without us having to try. Just being ourselves and being authentic. Or at the very least, we can attract people who like us for who we are.

People judge too fast (I include myself in this too) and we can only ignore it.

Ah yes and another thing that also helped me a lot and kinda goes into the same spectrum: when someone has a problem with you, like a stranger thinking that your outfit is ugly, then that is their problem. Do you know what I mean? It doesn't/ shouldn't concern you wheter a stranger, who you see once in your life, or another person, who you might not even like or care about, has a problem with something on or about you.

First off you are going to make it through Uni, now the question is how do you want to spend Uni? If I had any advice for my first year college self it would be to make an effort to be social. It’s hard I know but trust me you don’t want to end up like me and many others in this sub who regret hiding away during their university years.

Eating alone in dining halls, no one to talk to during lectures, always the last person to find a group/partner in projects/labs, staying in my room while everyone is having party during weekends...

The key is to not let those thoughts become obsessions it’s much easier said than done but you need to realize they’re just synapses in your brain firing off and only mean something if you pay attention to them. We have millions of thoughts a day some that are dumb, some that make no sense, and some that are cruel or crazy and guess what your anxiety comes from the same place as those. If you just let those thoughts pass and choose to focus on more positive or productive ones it really will help your situation	Putrid_Steak	reply	na	na	na	0.9990432858467102	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"My (M39) social anxiety presents as feelings of inferiority, paranoia that people are judging me negatively, and that I’m being perceived in different negative ways depending on what is bothering me at the time. This leads me to avoid groups pretty much full stop, gatherings, and places where I’ll have to return to repeatedly. For example picking up my children from the school gate.  I absolutely hate that, and these days I get my kids to walk across the road to a car park and I meet them there. So there is a lot of avoidance happening. 

However what really gets me are the moments, hours after the event where I tend to ruminate. My mind is like a virus that attacks my soul, continually finding new stories to tell me about what a failure I am. My thinking is totally irrational, to the point where if another person was there with me and I give my version of events, they can’t believe that I see it that way. But it happens over and over again. Who would want to put themselves through that? So I avoid.

I realise that therapy is my best option. CBT, ACT. Ive tried these but struggle to stick to them to the point where I make lasting change. I also have chronic depression and ADHD. 

Can anyone relate? Does anyone have any suggestions? It has well and truly taken over my life."	redpath88	post	24.95767056423047	female	White	0.9982513785362244	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety

Anyways, i ended up getting shoved in the middle with barely any arm space (we didnt get arranged we just had to brawl for dominance) between two dudes who had very tanned skin (at the time i had very pale skin). We had to hold books that they gifted us and because i got anxious i was the only one holding it wrong. Then, because i had a slight texting neck i tried to corecct it by moving my head back as far as i could and squaring up my shoulders and puffing up my chest while my legs were positioned as if i was about to fall down and refusing to smile because i knew i would just make it worse if i tried.I was holding on to that book like my life depended on it.

When I try to do any generic physical work/chore by myself (in a way to help people), people just see, interrupt me and do that by themselves as if they know it all, instead of teaching the 'how-to' to us. Even though I'm not anxious, people's eyes around and reluctant attitude towards me make me anxious. Why am I judged, just because I learn stuff a little slower (or in few attempts instead of just one or two attempts) than others? How can I learn to do stuff? Am I just surrounded by impatient people?	futile_but_alive	post	5.372967662842527	female	White	0.9978576302528381	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety

I didn't know other people had this experience. I'd say im fairly attractive even if people didn't like me i was never told i was unattractive. This lead me to be so cocky and feel like im better looking than everyone else this affected me way more in high school where I had social anxiety but thought I was better than everyone else except when I was alone. I was fairly nice to everyone but my SA did lead a girl to call me stuck up once in High school. Im not as arrogant and cocky anymore id say im more humble but i do mess around with my girlfriend by saying how amazing and perfect i am as a joke although typing that right now made me think maybe im not joking i might think. serisously thought just looking people in the eye and smiling and just making small talk really helped me. making fun of yourself or mistakes really helps aswell because it makes you seem human and relatable.	hsisnsjs	reply	na	na	na	0.9985840320587158	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"When I used to have social anxiety the same thing happened to me. I’d say I’m decently attractive, I’ve never had any problems with being rejected by girls I’ve been interested in. However, a good girl friend of mine (platonic) randomly told me one day that before she met me I appeared very unapproachable and standoffish.

This took me by surprise because I never considered myself unapproachable even though I now realize I was a 6’4 male who was considerable attractive and on top of that had debilitating anxiety. 

After that day, even thought I still had anxiety, I tried my best to counter my standoffish persona by forcing myself to smile at people more (even if it was fake) and making more eye contact. That way people feel “seen” by me, and I don’t come across rude.

Since you're new, ask as many questions as you want/can. It's important that you know how to do stuff plus you'll feel better yourself when you know what to do/how to do it. I mean it will take you some time to get used to the job but try to push through. Also idk what your position is exactly but if it's a customer service role at the store, you will encounter lots of kinds of people. Good ones and bad ones. Please keep in mind the assholes you'll have to serve are assholes themselves, don't take it personally if they start pulling shit. I don't wanna scare you, I just wanna give you a heads up cause when I first worked in retail, I took things personally. Remember it's got nothing to do with you. Assholes are assholes to everyone.

"God I'm hating myself lately. I want to be confident but it feels like I'll never be. I'm too grown now, 26, feels like if it hasn't happened, despite me working for it, it never will.

It's a company with about 150 employees. 

Right now there are maintenance works going on so I don't know if it's an employee or contractor sometimes.

So of course I see people I don't know and I feel awkward and don't know if I will look dumb if I smile or nod at them.

Also often I hate how every fibre of my being wants to walk looking down and slightly hunched.

I'm a woman with PCOS and my skin looks horrible with a lot of acne and scalp hair loss and facial hair (I always shave but constantly worry that it's visible still).

So I always hate walking in those bright lights and having someone see me up close.

hello. i have done loads of presentations since high school and it's now my second year of uni and still, nobody can hear me. the feedbacks for my presentation is always try speak louder next time. whenever it is a group task a group member would always tell me to 'speak louder' before my part, and i try my best and i thought i was literally shouting, but i would still get same feedback that my voice was too small, and i would feel so bad because it's a group task. i do get super nervous and my heart would beat really fast before i have to present so could it possibly be a biological thing? also, i used to have selective mutism in middle school and only started talking at school since high school so maybe that is also part of the reason. does anyone have the same problem. can you guys give me some tips on how to speak louder in public? thank you so much <3	omonayoudidnt	post	5.44740691073234	female	White	0.9899779558181763	na	na	na	3	socialanxiety
Practice! Practice! Practice! I used to be horrible at presenting until this year at university I went out of my way to practice as many times as possible then I actually did great! My advice is to try speaking at different audio levels try shouting your whole presentation, funny voices, Etc. Anything it takes to make you feel comfortable with the material your presenting and stretch out your voice. Confidence plays a big portion in our tone of speech so if you are more confident in your material you’ll be more confident speaking as well.	omonayoudidnt	reply	na	na	na	0.9899779558181763	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"Does anyone have any tricks? I’ve paid for a gym membership for the past 2 months hoping I’d get the courage to go. I went ONE time and all I did was go in a make sure my barcode could scan and lied to the front desk and said that I was only there bc I wanted to make sure it would scan so I could go to a different gym location and workout. I got the membership to a gym with multiple locations that are all 24 hours. I was hoping to go late at night when no one was there but I always make excuses for myself. 

I just weighed myself and I’m the most I’ve ever weighed in my life, i.e. 128.4. I’m 5’5’’ for reference. It might not seem like a lot to people but its a lot to me and I feel really insecure about my body in particular with my stomach and lower back which has been accumulating visceral fat. Every time I walk past mirrors in my home I think negative things about myself and its serves as a reminder of what I’m not doing. If I’m lying down I look down at my stomach and giggle it or squeeze it together to make a donut with it with my belly button as the hole. Lol It’s really not a healthy practice, I know.

In attempt to get myself to exercise I spent around $400 on exercise equipment for home use but of course I never use it because my apartment is too small and also the longer I go the harder it becomes to do anything. I know. I’m full of excuses. 

Sorry for the long rant about this… its been over a year now since I’ve been to the gym. Just looking to see if anyone has any ideas about what I can do to get myself back in the gym. 

Historically I realize now the only reason I was ever really able to get active in the gym is because I went with a partner or paid for a personal trainer. I REALLY don’t want to do that at this point though because my SA is worse than its ever been and I’m looking for things I can do that only involve me… and the SA subreddit lol"	peki-pom	post	25.622870344699006	female	White	0.9989253878593445	na	na	na	4	socialanxiety
Since your gym is 24 hours maybe go during “less busy” hours like early in the morning, mid-day, or at night. I’ve been in your exact situation of procrastinating and I promise you the only way to change that is to start now. Your brain doesn’t believe in itself because you haven’t done what it wants to do, which is fine that’s fixable but you have to change. I also like listening to albums, podcasts or even watch Netflix while I run. It gives me something to keep my mind on and even helps when my motivation to hit the gym is low. I’m sure you’ve heard it a thousand times but people at the gym really don’t pay attention to other people and if they read that post they would probably encourage you to go like I am now. Once you start building discipline and get your groove on things you’ll be happier, more confident, and you’ll be in better shape.

"I am the same way and from your weight & height I can say I started at a much larger BMI than your at. I didn’t let myself buy any workout clothes or exercise equipment until I was consistently working out. I downloaded the app Body by Blogilates and YouTube on my phone then started doing 20 minute workouts in the comfort of my home everyday. I was very deconditioned so I could hide how much I struggled and how I had to modify every single move. I kept with it tho because no social anxiety inside the home, started to buy myself nice exercise clothes, started to become in better shape, and gained more confidence to workout in front of others. I’d also recommend you try not to tug and pull or play with the fat on your body. That fat is there to protect and nourish you, your body is your best friend and will be with you every second of your life. Try to create a loving relationship with your body, don’t poke at it or make fun, treat it like it’s the body of somebody you love dearly. Working out because you know your body deserves movement will be a much more positive journey for you than working out because you dislike the way your body looks.

I hope this doesn’t sound preachy this is what I am always telling myself. I too used to make donuts with my belly fat anytime I sat down.

Much of the progress individuals achieve in managing anxiety depends on how others react to them. When interacting with new people, it's important to note that more often than not, they approach the situation with benevolence, as we are essentially both blank slates. Consequently, after creating a positive impression, the intention is to maintain that image. This explains why self-doubt often arises before seeking help; the aim is to avoid jeopardizing the favorable impression that has been established.

"(Not a native english speaker so please don't be harsh because of spelling/grammar mistakes)  


I finished my school and was willing to try to something like a high school graduation in my country. So I went to a new school this monday and my anxiety is worse than ever. I sit in my classes and I am almost always at the verge of crying. I can't focus on the lessons because I have the most fear I've ever had. I told my mum that I can't and won't go to school and she understands it. But in my country you are obliged to go to school until a certain age. So we tried going to a psychiatrist because I am already on a waiting list for therapy.  
She said that she won't prescribe any medication and won't set me free from school. I should go to school so I can face my fears to get better. She said that this is the only thing that can work because when you have a sense of achievement after you managed to do something there you will get better. She talked a lot about how I won't be scared after I ""get used to it"" and some other serious bullshit - This anxiety is nothing anyone can get used to. At least I can't. I am so scared that I will try everything to not even get into these situations where I could have that sense of achievement because it could go wrong and then I'll feel a lot worse and I can't do anything about it. I told her many times that I really can't and if it doesn't get better I will seriously consider commiting suicide because I won't be able to go through this especially not for 3 years.  
After that she said that she will write a recommendation for me to try an antidepressant. She said it's the only one that can be prescribed for people under 18 and that she ""doesn't think much of it"". It will take a few weeks until I will be able to get that medication - and (I guess) a few weeks for them to actually affect me? And even if they do I still highly doubt that they will help a lot especially without intense therapy which I will have to wait a long time for. And in this entire time I should go to school. And it's really not just me not liking and feeling uncomfortable being there - I literally can't stand it, it is torture for me.  


I've had that feeling before when I did my Internship which was 3 weeks long. I've fallen into deep depression during that time because of it. In those 3 weeks I already had a lot of suicidal thoughts and a death wish. But the situation wasn't as bad as now because I knew it was only for 3 weeks and not years. When I couldn't even handle 3 weeks of that how am I supposed to do this?? I don't want to commit sucide - I really don't. I have people that love and care for me and I don't want to disappoint them. But I feel like I ran out of options at this point. I'm scared, please help me."	Forsaken_Profile_479	post	13.5239275649831	female	White	0.9993512034416199	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety
"My heart truly aches reading this because to some extent, I really relate deep inside... And thank you for not giving up. The fact that you posted and opened up your heart on here shows tremendous courage and as you already mentioned, never forget that you have people who love and care for you, even the ones who don't even know your name on here online. This might not even help, but I'm honestly going through something similar... To me that source of fear comes from church. I continue to have panic attacks while I'm there, social situations with the people there scare me, I feel so outcasted and misunderstood, and when you said ""I literally can't stand it, it is torture for me"" that's very similar to what I shared with my therapist and how I feel... Although what your psychiatrist shared can be helpful to some, when it's extreme fear and torturous feeling, we just literally can't... 

My therapist told me that my pattern is to avoid uncomfortable and scary situations and that avoidance brings comfort, but in the long run, it might not help especially because I have such ambitious goals, that right now feel impossible to achieve because of my fears... But what I also got out of him is that it's okay to let your heart relax and rest first. Personally, I thought of a bear. In order for a bear to live a healthy and happy life as a bear, in the wintertime they have to sleep, not just for a few hours, but hibernate and literally underground for months! And maybe similarly, what we might need is time away for ourselves. Currently, I choose to only talk to my therapist, parents, boyfriend, and a few friends who understand what I'm going through and decided to stick by. 

I'm not a doctor or a medical professional of any sort so I might be wrong, but I personally think taking a break is okay. And to me, you sound like someone who wants to get better and grow, but just not sure how. You're strong! I believe our natural healing abilities are strong! Maybe I haven't been much of help, but I just wanted to share that you're not alone on this journey and that me, a stranger from online, is truly rooting for you and hoping that we can both grow stronger from this so that one day, we'll laugh about what we once went through that made us stronger.

"I went to a social anxiety support group!!! I only managed to introduce myself, but hopefully will get easier to speak up with time.


One of the topics that came up, was how sometimes we struggle to behave differently, because we feel like people have already an idea in mind of how you are, and you wouldn't be able to change it. Say, you're anxious and only can manage to barely greet your neighbour in passing. But then you're even more anxious about getting out of your comfort zone and starting an actual conversation another time because you've already come across as unfriendly,  and it would come across as weird if you just started having a full blown conversation with them.

"Hello all, unsure to really go to project some fears and worries I'm having recently. With little hope with people to talk to.? Hopefully this will be the place I could get some advice on...

There's been a new Martial Arts Centre that's opened in my area. I've signed up there recently... I know its terrifying and completely nerve racking to start but I'm trying everything that I can to overcome this fear.

I've got my first beginners boxing class today (also picking Jiu-Jitsu) and I'm fucking terrified to go down and get involved. 

Historically, I've always never really fit in... I've been ridiculed and bullied in the past (as close to 13 - 16 years of age, now 28) when I've ventured out and tried new things. 

I'm worried history is going to repeat itself and I'll loose another thing I could potentially enjoy or just remind myself that I might not be good enough.

I'm not worried about keeping active, years of bullying has kept my in the gym since 17.  It's the fear of being left out, embarrassed or not clicking with the social groups.

I'm trying my damn hardest to remain positive, to remind myself that this fear and weakness needs and must be challenged to grow and delvop. Reminding myself that this will be good for Personal development, confidence and overall health.

However, the anxiety is really piling up and its a fucking big wall to climb over to achieve what I need to go do.

Hope there's kind words, support and advice. Thank you for taking the time to read too."	LongjumpingDiver4944	post	24.267676083699957	female	White	0.008243508636951447	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety
"As scary as it may be the first time you show up, the whole thing is gonna be better overtime. 

Since you're going to a martial arts gym, you'll probably meet people who want to be there and have their own reasons to go. If you can start a conversation with someone and get to know what they like about martial arts or what brought them there you might get a buddy there.

Usually every martial art has their own stance and moves, so expect to fall down and fail a lot until you can get the hang of it, but try not to let it embarass you. If you practiced another martial art you would fail anyway because of different stances and moves.

Depending on the instructor, they might preffer to have everyone at the same pace or teach everyone according to their pace, anyway, ask your instructor whenever you're in doubt or just want some feedback. Soon enough you'll get the hang of it.

The best of luck to you man."	LongjumpingDiver4944	reply	na	na	na	0.008243508636951447	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"Hi. The following text may or may not be a super common ""help with self diagnosis"" thing to post, but I can't seem to find an FAQ or posts with a similar case to me, so here goes.

I'm relatively good with keeping up a conversation, I can talk with people for hours on end about a whole range of different topics, and I love doing it, but: 

I still have just one irl friend. And it's only because they approached me first. Yes, that is the thing, I literally physically cannot approach people unless I absolutely need to or they do it first. And they almost never do, even though I'm frequently going outside, making myself available, just like, sitting around in the park with nothing to do. //Idk, maybe I just look like shit or smth.// And when it comes to me being on the opposite end of this, like trying to approach a person I like and would like to talk to, I just die inside. Like, I can't even look in their general direction, not even talking about speaking to them. I just want someone to talk to, why do I have to deal with this shit?

In my current state of life (17, disabled, not the best of parents), I can't get therapy in any way except literally battling for it with my parents. ""You don't need it"", ""It won't help you"", yada yada yada. And also there's a general lack of specialists where I live, which makes it even harder. So because of this I can't get an official confirmation or denial of my suspicion of having SA, nor am I able to get help for it. So I picked the next best thing and at least decided to talk to some people on the internet who may just know a thing or two. I'm open to any further questions btw, for some additional helpful information.

Thanks in advance!"	Daftpunker_	post	14.70947469398268	male	White	0.9947199821472168	na	na	na	3	socialanxiety
"Hmm your situations does seems to be a bit paradoxical indeed... You have lots of trouble starting a conversation but then you can talk for hours on end if someone else starts it.

Just how does these conversations go? Do you just answer people? Do you add new topics or content to the conversation by yourself?

It could be some anxiety mostly focused on starting the conversation or it could be that you have a more severe anxiety but happens to know how to keep a conversation flowing. Maybe your anxiety is about keeping a relationship with people.

I would like to know how you feel when you're talking to people when they approach you first and how you feel about approaching people."	Daftpunker_	reply	na	na	na	0.9947199821472168	no	no	strong	na	socialanxiety
"Oh, when the conversation has already started it's going like with normal people, we both add new topics, discuss them, laugh about stuff, etc. That's why I like it and would like more of it - I like talking but I simply have no one to talk to. I just cannot for the life of me approach them first. I think it stems from a fear of being perceived as weird or creepy. (which my internet-dwelling lifestyle and internalized transphobia seem to reinforce (yes, I forgot to add that I'm MtF trans).) I'm terrified of the person being like ""Ew, weirdo, gtfo"" or something along the lines. Idk, it seems childish maybe, but that's just how it is."

"It's not childish, it can be very difficult to approach someone first, specially if they look busy. But also don't forget that people like being remembered, so even some small talk is welcome.

I think you could try and start your conversations with a question, that way the other person can start a bigger more interesting conversation with an answer.

Maybe asking how an event went or about some recent news around town could be enough to spark a conversation."	Daftpunker_	reply	na	na	na	0.9947199821472168	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety

I don't really know how to get over it, but it usually passes with time. I don't really know what triggers it. I have some idea that because of my anxiety, I don't go out and I don't talk to people, and so my life feels very empty in return, and some days that feeling is more heavy than usual. 

I feel trapped by myself as well. There are so many things I should be able to do that anxiety prevents me from doing and it's like I don't have control over my own free will.

"Okay, so I’ve never been big on parties or gatherings, but my mom arranged a dinner for my birthday. Normally this would be fine, but she invited my brother and his girlfriend, neither of which I’m comfortable around (my brother is one of the reasons I have anxiety, and his girlfriend is too…not friendly, but she’s really out there).

I’d honestly be happier if it were just immediate family, but there’s no changing my mom’s mind. So I need advice on how to act normal, not panic and not stutter or stumble over my words.

Another thing I struggle with is showing emotion in a normal way. I don’t show my excitement because it feels awkward for me, and I don’t want them to give me a gift and me just awkwardly thank them. I want them to feel my excitement and see it, but I don’t know how to do that without overthinking it."

Try and stick with your closest friend or family throughout the birthday and just try and greet everyone with a ""hello"" and ""thanks for coming"" and give them a goodbye when it ends.

When it comes to accepting gifts, you could accept it, thank them for it and give a handshake or a hug with a smile. Since it's a birthday dinner it also sounds a bit formal, so something like this would be nice."	Student_of_Lingling	reply	na	na	na	0.9961191415786743	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"19F. I've had social anxiety for a while, probably since I was 13. I worked at a health clinic for six months last year, and I quit because it was very isolating and I didn't have much to do. Fast forward to now, and I've been working at a local bakery for three months. It was okay, but then the cake icers wanted me to try icing cakes. Icing cakes was a lot of fun for me. I felt really fulfilled and even though I haven't had any prior experience (and they knew that), I thought I was doing a good job.

After 1 1/2 months of icing, I heard the icers asking the front end lady to put me back on the schedule. The front end lady said ""you don't like the way she ices?"" and the icers said ""no."". I didn't really understand why, but I didn't really see the point in asking. I don't expect people to be nice to me, but things like that really crush my confidence and bring on some social anxiety.

I only work 1-2 times a week for five hours, which isn't great. we don't even get the tips we're given either.

I've been working at the front of the bakery since then. I answer phone calls, take cake orders, and all that. It's been a lot for my anxiety, but I've been managing. Last Friday I was doing good, and keeping a positive attitude about work. I started ringing this guy up. He gave me a twenty, so I put it on the touch screen and entered it. After I did it, he gave me some change. The way the register works, you can't go back and put more on the amount. The register does the math for you. Usually I can do it in my head, but there were lots of people in line and my boss was right next to me. My brain just froze, and I was frozen as well.

He told me the change he needed, and said something like ""I'm an educator and I can't believe what they're teaching kids these days, it's crazy."" and my boss said ""Yeah its a huge pet peeve for me, I can't stand it."" they said more but I was too mortified to listen. After they both left, the next lady behind him said ""Oh honey. I'm so sorry, bless your heart."" Afterwards, all I wanted was to sink into the floor and disappear. It made me feel so humiliated. Its like the guy got off on embarrassing a young person.

I'm not sure if stuff like that bothers normal people, but I just wanted to sob in my car. This job has been really difficult on my anxiety. It's custom cakes, so there's lots of things you need to know, and my brain just hasn't been able to keep up and I feel so stupid. I make mistakes a lot, too many to count. All of my mistakes really pile onto my anxiety, and makes me feel like I'm unimportant and not good at my job. I had a late lunch, so I asked if I could go. There was 25 minutes left, and I just didn't go back. I know it was bad, and you can't just leave your job. I just felt like my boss thought I was stupid anyway, so I didn't see the point in staying there.

I came back today because my name was on the schedule, and the front end lady took me and asked what happened, and I just said I was having car problems. She told me I should've called, and that someone had to stay behind and work. My boss took me off the schedule because they thought I quit. She said sometimes people do that because they want to leave, and she asked if I wanted to, and I said no. I'm not sure why I did, probably because I'm terrible at actually telling people things.

I just hate my anxiety and I hate that it causes me to make stupid decisions. I'm really avoidant and once something happens I just disappear. It's not fun."	Intrepid_Chemical_87	post	32.366323909566844	female	White	0.9981037378311157	na	na	na	20	socialanxiety
It sounds like your workplace isn’t healthy. A good manager will try to get you to recognize mistakes and ways you can improve. Not put you down or ignore potential shortfalls. Customers can be downright rude at times. I also had extremely bad anxiety and am just now starting to work through it. If it makes you feel any better, you’ll start to realize that a job is just a way for you to make money. You start to build experiences throughout your daily life and as you get older you’d realize sometimes there’s moments that’s not worth getting anxious about. I know the crushing feeling of embarrassment through anxiety provoking experiences. But honestly you are incredibly young and you’re learning. Be easy on yourself.

Girl, you are not alone!! I’ve had a very similar situation happen to me after I just graduated college. The only job I could get right out of college was at Target (HATED it). I was in the retail part but often they had to call for us to help out with the registers, and our registers were the same where after you punched in the amount, there was no going back. I had people do that to me all the time. It was SO annoying. Like, either get your shit together and give me the exact change, or let me know you have extra change. But don’t hand me a $50 bill and 5 minutes later, hand me your change you want to get rid of after I’ve already closed the register. I had the exact same situation happen to me, except it was the customer who was extremely rude about it. It made me feel really shitty especially knowing I was not dumb as I had just graduated with my bachelors and this guy probably didn’t even graduate high school. Another time I ran out of $10s and $20s and I kept asking my managers for more money, but no one came to give me more money.  a middle aged man YELLED at me because he gave me a $50 and all I could give him back in change was $5s and $1s since that’s all I had left. As he stood there yelling at me, his wife stood next to him smirking at me. It was awful and I burst out crying. Then of course my dumb ass manager happened to finally stop by to give me money for the register. I quit soon after that. It’s been 4 years since that incident and at my time there, I’ve seen at least 3 of my co workers cry because of how shitty retail is. I honestly forgot all about it until I saw this post lol. The point is, two years down the line you’ll forget all about it and also people are just assholes sometimes. Looking back, I wish I would have stood up for myself and told him not to yell at me, or honestly just closed the register and walked away right then and there.

"It's taken me a long time to get used to this as well. I know it's hard, but recognize that your failure to please the icers and their response to that says nothing about you as a person, and everything about them as a coworker and mentor. It takes wayyy more than one month for someone to become extremely competent and self-sufficient at a job they have absolutely no experience in.

I hate how frequently I see someone complaining about someone else's lack of productivity in the workplace, when the reality is THEY are the one that was supposed to train them. It's not about ADHD or autism or this or that mental bottleneck, I honestly do not believe that nearly as many people who are made to think they are slow learners actually are. The fact of the matter is people just really suck at teaching, and love blaming others for it.

That guy said himself that he's an educator. Why isn't he trying to help kids get smarter, rather than making unnecessarily rude comments to some 19 year old girl at her second job of, what, 5 months?

It took me over three months to become comfortable at a job I was just thrown into, and a year later I was the best worker in the building, I was receiving so much praise it was honestly annoying. My boss confided in me that he really didn't have much hope for me when I started. Tell me, do you think that must mean I am utterly stupid? Or maybe I just needed to learn how to do things correctly and time to practice and get familiar with the job. Some people are just impatient and awful at teaching others.

Unfortunately there are some people who also go out of their way to make others feel less than, because it tickles their monkey brain for whatever reason. To me, that proves *they* are stupid. I mean, how dumb is it to expect someone to know everything about something they have no experience in? No one's psychic.

FWIW, if you were financially secure enough to just walk out of that job and never come back, I totally would. That boss obviously does not have any interest in bettering you as an employee, and working there will not get you anywhere. Yes, that's generally bad advice, but I'm not so sure they would have given you a good reference for your next job anyway. I definitely recommend getting the hell out ASAP, that place is not going to do you any favors."	Intrepid_Chemical_87	reply	na	na	na	0.9981037378311157	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"It’s really not professional to just dip out during a shift and tell no one, anxiety or not. It’s hard being an adult, but sometimes you just have to suck it up, get through the shift and apply to other jobs that may suite your personality (something with less social interaction like packaging, mailing, nightshift jobs, door dash) in the meantime. Go to therapy, read therapy books on anxiety if you can’t afford therapy, learn and work through your anxiety, and when you have that handled better, then try a more heavy social interaction job like the bakery or other retail stores. Or just don’t do retail, go find something you like that requires zero or low social interaction. 

Don’t put this bakery job as a reference on any future applications. 
And don’t leave shifts unannounced anymore- it’s letting your anxiety win and crippling your growth.

Having anxiety sucks. But It’s not an excuse to inconvenience others. It’s not your fault either, but it’s your responsibility to take care of.

"Wanna text a ‘love you’ but you’re fearful you’re love bombing them? Do it.

Wanna just randomly call them to hear their voice but too scared you’re coming off as clingy? Do it.

Want to give them space but fear lacking communication is a death sentence? Do it.

Want to randomly hug them or hold their hand but fear you’re being too much? Do it.

So many fears and for so long I waited on what he was going to do. I waited for his cues. Wanted him to text first, the first to say I love you etc. Almost like I didn’t know how to show love.

I manufactured a distance then questioned why my relationship was distant. I made my own demise. I let my anxiety and insecurities rule my mind. I then thought it was him. So I asked for more not knowing I was the one starving my relationship. I overanalysed him to a point he felt like he was under a microscope. Then questioned why he was being distant.

Sometimes you have to let go of that fear, and trust. And do what you want for your partner, to reach inside and be free of worry and learn to love. And most importantly love yourself.

It’s a hard lesson to learn but sometimes you have to question what do I fear doing in this situation? And do it. Learn that you’re worth it. You’re worth the love, from others and yourself."	Fenice101	post	27.320566316347183	female	White	0.001358521869406104	na	na	na	30	socialanxiety

"Anxious Attachment Style Club here. 

As a person who started the journey of conquering my fears, I have to point out how important it is to distinguish between ""facing your fears"" and ""doing compulsions"" to calm your anxiety. 

For example, if you have an anxious attachment style, constant love-bombing, calling, seeking attention, and reassurance is THE COMPULSION. It will temporarily calm your worries, but it will never be enough. Giving someone space is an important skill we need to learn. We also need to work on having a support group outside of the relationship so we won't rely on one person 100%. 

But if you see a knife, and your intrusive thoughts scream at you that you will butcher someone if you grab the knife, then you should know that ""not grabbing the knife"" is the compulsion; avoiding this negative feeling is a compulsion. You should say, ""What happens that happens,"" and take the knife to cook dinner. 

What helped me a lot was learning to recognize anxiety symptoms. Now, when I have intrusive thoughts, I'm not as scared as I used to be; I'm a bit annoyed, as if this thought were a nagging mosquito, but I'm not scared. 

At the end of the day, we are NOT BROKEN, there is NOTHING to fix. Let anxiety have fun because it's learning only when turned on. And ironically, this little bitch really loves us and is worried as hell about us; we should show her that we're safe."	Fenice101	reply	na	na	na	0.001358521869406104	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

Then move up to maybe watching videos of people in elevators, then maybe go an find an elevator and just watch from a distance. Add steps as and when you feel able.

"I just want to start off by saying I'm a 20M and I've had social anxiety probably my whole life. I've tried everything to help. weed made it worse I would just get paranoid. never took pills long enough to see a lasting improvement because it made my head feel like it was full of cement. My SA just got worse After high school because i stopped hanging out with my friends as much and I took all my classes online, it sucked because my friends made my anxiety go down but I just powered through it. I eventually got a job doing Gigs such as Instacart which helped me get out of my comfort zone and talk to more people. Still, there isn't a lot of talking going on but it did help me get better although I wouldn't say significantly. I also stupidly thought once I got a gf my SA would go away since I wouldn't care about what other girls think or what anyone thinks. I was wrong I still care and it's been 3 years. So no matter what anxiety has just stuck with me. I also have really bad phone anxiety and I don't know why I hate making calls. I used to pace around the room for a while before I make a call, it has gotten better over time but making calls in front of people especially family still gives me anxiety. I prefer making calls alone.

  
Anyways, Now that everyone knows how pessimistic I am about getting rid of social anxiety i can get to the good part. I recently got a job doing something similar to what I was doing but at an actual grocery store and I told myself I would try to be more outgoing and talk to people. And it's hard, some days I only feel like saying Hi to certain people some days i don't want o say hi to anyone but I would try to say Hi and make small talk no matter how awkward it was. I hate hearing ""Nobody is going to remember what you said or did it's in your head"" because I know that but it will still bother me all night long thinking about it until 3AM not being able to sleep. but regardless I still keep pushing on. I fake being outgoing at work and every day it gets slightly easier. At least once a week ill do or say something i think is cringe that ill think about all day/night but i still push through. maybe its like exposure therapy, recently I was told by management that I was doing a great job and was asked if i was interested in becoming part of management and managing people under me. And if there's one thing that influences me more than SA its money so I applied and interviewed for the position which i thought i would bomb but i ended up getting it and now im a Manager. I dont think im a leader or someone who would ever be good at management but im going to work my ass off and force myself to do something that frightens me and do something i usually would avoid because of my SA. Since my promotion, I have been talking to all my co-workers a lot more and its getting way easier and im not overthinking and second-guessing myself as much anymore. Although there are times I think to myself ""it's been quiet for too long you need to say something"" its not bother me as much anymore. I also recently did the Closing announcement that can be heard throughout the whole store and i fucking butchered it i sounded like a robot but At the time i didn't care and i still dont! which is crazy I feel like i should be freaking out about it but im not.

  
moral of the story is to get out there and get out of your comfort bubble that's what i did and it helped tremendously. I really hope this helps someone out.

I heard of a study where they got people with SA to talk in a group and one person told their experience of how anxious they were and how they thought everyone was judging them but in reality, everyone else thought he was much calmer than he thought he was. so it makes sense why she thought you were confident and outgoing because that may be how you are as a person, our mind just makes us very insecure.

"Just curious if anyone else is fine talking to strangers/small talk but has trouble forming deeper connections and making friends?

With strangers I can adopt this ""it's not a big deal if I'm awkward since I'm never gonna see them again"" mindset, but with coworkers/classmates I know that I will have to continue interacting and socializing with them and it really gets in the way of me making friends.

Any tips or insight would be appreciated!"	flathead17	post	9.81639855205513	female	White	0.9900272488594055	na	na	na	3	socialanxiety

Exactly same as @zogonzo. It’s the first thing that doctors prescribe you for anxiety and it’s the safest etc. it did absolutely NOTHING for my anxiety, only made me drowsy. If I couldn’t sleep bc of my anxiety I’d take it and I would be extra tired but STILL unable to sleep because I was so anxious. The only med that has ever helped my anxiety is xanax but I only take it in emergencies. Better to take natural approach when it comes to anxiety bc you don’t want to become reliant.

I hope I didn't mess up my career.

We had a huge company party today but I didn't go. My social anxiety has been through the roof since July. I've been really struggling. I had to make so many calls due to issues with my ADHD meds, I was at my wit's end. I really had to push myself to get shit done with various pharmacies and my own provider.

Anyways, I had no energy to go and I said on Friday that I won't be able to. I was actually able to fix issues with my ADHD meds yesterday, so I'm kinda free. Everyone at work was like ""you're the only one not going"" and I feel bad. Everyone tried to get me to go today. I took a shower after work to try to get ready for the party and started having mini panic attacks. I really need to recharge.

I struggle with badly internalised adhd, it’s like all that energy is going on in my head and I can’t even get a word out. It’s exasperates my anxiety symptoms badly, I found since I started on modafinil my adhd is so much more outward. I’ve had some amazing interactions this past week and a lot of the symptoms of anxiety were routed by adhd. I still struggle with SAD but honestly it’s like %50 and I can’t believe it.

"I’ve been experimenting with ADHD meds lately after a recent diagnosis and although still anxious I’ve noticed such a huge difference, I never had the outgoing loud side of ADHD so nobody ever pulled it. It’s like all that adhd energy was internalised in my mind so everyone else is relaxed and having a conversation but my mind was off flapping in 100 directions worrying about judgement what to say and a million other anxious thoughts that result in not being present.

Since I started meds and have become more conscious I’m finding my ADHD is more OUTWARD and it’s been such a breath of fresh air, I feel so different and the more I try to reframe the better I feel like I’m doing.

I guess I posted this because some of you may be similar.

I, on the contrary, get much less anxious during video calls than voice calls. With video, at least I see the other person's emotional expressions and gestures, and they provide a lot of context. Moreover, moments of silence feel less awkward, because the other person sees that I'm still online but just thinking for a moment. I feel also less urgency in video calls than in phone calls, and that's another reason why they stress me less.	YourgirlCarme_n	reply	na	na	na	0.9991967082023621	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"Sometimes very shy people need a loving,  gentle push to socialize. Lots of smiling and reassurance  so she doesn’t get stuck in her ahead assuming that she’s the problem. I would say keep trying to include her, do your best to reassure her and show her that you all like and appreciate her, and most importantly want her to be there. People with SA tend to distort reality, we get stuck in our heads and listen to our warped thoughts (“I don’t belong here, I’m too weird, they hate me, they are just being nice but they secretly regret having me come here, etc”). Hopefully, she’ll warm up to the family as she becomes more comfortable.
Maybe try talking to her in French? You can use a translation app. She may be self conscious of her English.

I say this in attempts to motivate you not insult you: You got two options now and choose wisely because it matters, either succumb to going back to a weak mentality and forfeiting all the progress you made, or choose to be resilient and work towards making *even more* progress towards freedom. Become spiteful of the anxiety and fuel yourself to fight it ten times harder. Harden your mental state and don’t let it rot because of an event that wants to hold you back.

Your communication skills probably *did* improve. Maybe it wasn't “enough” for this place, but that doesn't mean it wasn't enough in general. It's still progress. Mourn the loss and then try to use what you learned here elsewhere. Nobody comes out of the gate swinging, being a master at socializing or communicating. Truth be told, plenty of people suck at communication, but aren't even aware of the problem. The fact that you know you have things to work on is a strength. You managed to keep a job and challenge your social anxiety. Maybe it didn't turn out exactly as you hoped, but I still think that's worth celebrating, don't you? Restaurants can be very fast paced. Maybe something a bit more low key would work better for you? Either way, your feelings are valid, but try to avoid beating yourself up over this. Don't just focus on the negatives.

"Some of the worst settings for my anxiety is being at a family event/birthday or anything similiar. Worst is being at a restaurant. I just can't stand the expectations towards me and being at the mercy of the situation. Nevertheless I just hate restaurants for some reason.

I don't like people to serve me food (which to me is nothing but a slave-like manner) neither do I like to celebrate the act of eating in such a fashion. You sit on your ass for an eternity, much too close to another person face to face and you just can't escape it. The rule is: Sit here for the next 30 Minutes minimum! 
Eat! Drink! Talk! And then after about 2 hours, it's time to piss off!

I also don't really like forced appointments and don't like it when people basically have nothing to say to each other but force some trivial conversation.

Why is this restaurant appointment setting living hell to me? Can someone relate?

It could have to do with the fact that I don't like a lot of my family members to be honest. I find they are narcissistic, jugding and self-absorbed assholes.

"Being in a restaurant with friends, coworkers or acquaintances doesn't stress me much, but eating out alone (which is inevitable when traveling) feels like a bit of horror to me. I feel like I'm bothering the staff and unnecessarily occupying a table that would be used by more people in another case.

It's even worse in countries where there are no clear rules about tipping. Where I live some people tip (although not in every type of restaurant) and some do not, so I'm never sure whether or not I'm perceived as a boor by the staff.

>I don't like people to serve me food (which to me is nothing but a slave-like manner)

"My social anxiety has definitely improved as I’ve gotten older but I still struggle in certain situations. For example if I have to meet people that are important to someone else in my life.

I don’t want them to not like me. So if there’s alcohol I will drink and my confidence soars and I can have a conversation. 

However recently I was out with some girlfriends of my boyfriends friends, only met them a couple of times, I did not feel comfortable, and didn’t felt like I fit in. I drank a lot a mixture of all sorts and I mostly just spoke about things that my boyfriend does which annoy me. I feel like everything I personally was frustrated by or not happy with we’re just projected onto these people I barely new, I’m sure it gave an impression I did not love him which is not true.

I spent 2 days with crippling anxiety and vommiting from this because actually this time I think the alcohol portrayed me as not a nice person which is exactly what I wanted to avoid. I felt like I had betrayed my boyfriend, when I know there’s things about me that annoys him, maybe I just wanted to vent but these people and the time was no appropriate. 

There’s been a few times we’re I’ve lost all sense of boundaries and what’s appropriate.

That's sadly the game you play with alcohol. There was a time when I was close to becoming an alcoholic because of this. Thankfully I avoided that. I still give myself a bit of Dutch courage every now and then but I try not to. I've also found that sometimes the anxiety is too strong. I remember drinking 3-4 half glasses of whiskey ahead of a social once. I felt nothing when I got there. I only felt the effects of the alcohol when I started to relax a bit and boy did it hit me. Alcohol does help with social anxiety. Anybody who says it doesn't is lying. That said, it does nothing to address the underlying problem and has a high risk of causing addiction, so generally I'd say use in moderation or not at all. Be really honest with yourself. If you have an addictive personality or you think you may become reliant on it, then avoid it as much as possible. Alcoholism is absolutely not worth it.

I look at any substance as the rebound effect will be the opposite. I am now addicted to alcohol because I used it for social anxiety and my social anxiety and anxiety in general has skyrocketed since drinking well regularly. The very first benzo barbiturates which now are barely prescribed, mimic alcohol and takes away the inhibition just like alcohol. You really don’t want to be addicted or use benzos or alcohol because it completely messes up your gaba neurotransmitter.

"my best tip is to talk to someone about it!! the struggle is so much harder and lasts so much longer if you’re going through it by yourself. if you have any sort of mental health counselor or therapist at your school, I 100% recommend going to talk to them. if that isn’t possible, try to find someone you can trust to talk to about it.

my other tips are to build up your self esteem and to be patient with yourself. it’s okay to be awkward and to not know how to talk to people. it’s okay to be anxious. what’s not okay is making yourself feel bad about those things. be patient with yourself and build yourself up. 

I know the root of all the anxiety I used to have (and still have sometimes) was low self esteem. I hated how I looked and always felt inferior to other people, so it made it hard to join conversations without feeling like they’re judging me. it was a long process but after I started improving my perception of myself, a lot of the anxiety went away.

it’s always really awkward when you first try to go out and talk to people, but the more you do it, the easier it gets. I know it’s extremely hard, but it is possible for you to get over it. remember to be patient with yourself when you struggle and to replace any negative thoughts in your internal monologue with positive ones.

Basically, whenever people do things that upset me I just ignore it. I can’t handle the fight, and don’t ever feel like the pure anxiety of arguing with someone is worth the energy. From this I have admittedly become a people pleaser, and the past year I’ve been trying to learn to say no.
  
This brings me to tonight. I have had a few things truly bothering me in my relationship (together 10 years). The things aren’t even what’s important. We’re still a happy couple. But tonight was one of the very few times that I started the argument. I wanted to get out my feelings and try to not let myself brush it aside. All in all I think it was fine, it wasn’t like a horrible fight or anything. But now, my husband is asleep. And all I can think is that he hates me. He is probably so mad. I want to wake him up and apologize. I want to take everything back. Does anyone have advice for this? It’s not healthy for me to not express negative emotions but this terrible feeling I have right now is making me want to double down on my silence. If no one reads this it’s fine. It feels good to vent."	BradleyNowellLives	post	21.34383835645371	female	White	0.9923362135887146	na	na	na	5	socialanxiety
"You had been bottling up those things that bother you for likely a long time now. As a people pleaser trying to learn to stand up for herself, you should feel proud for even trying to voice those things to your husband!! Longtime over-ruminated thoughts are what I find the hardest to share. Even small things feel agonizing after having enough time to psych yourself about the act of speaking them.

The quote that stands out to me the most is ""All in all I think it was fine, it wasn’t like a horrible fight or anything."" To me, that is what makes me feel like he definitely DOESN'T hate you. And that he probably ISN'T that mad. That sounds like the anxiety talking.

Give yourself a pat on the back for trying to speak your mind. Don't double down on the silence. Don't take everything back. The bad feeling is temporary, things will probably be just fine!"	BradleyNowellLives	reply	na	na	na	0.9923362135887146	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
I react very similarly. What I think happens is that because I bottle up things so much, they come out like a flood and I need an unhealthy amount of reassurance to know my emotions were valid. I've started journaling to help me in this, I kinda talk to myself like I'm a therapist, like an objective pair of eyes, so maybe you might find this helpful.

"As far back as I can remember I have memories of being ostracized, treated as if there was something wrong with me. Eventually this turned into physical attacks as well, being hit with books, grabbed, kicked in the nuts etc. Everywhere I went I was scoped in as a target to make miserable. This continued from kindergarten to 8th grade it seems, it only stopped in high school when I went to a small charter school that didn't have any bullies. But it was too late by that point, my mind was already ruined.

I'm now 28 years old, I have zero self-esteem and zero friends. I long for friendship and human connection while simultaneously having absolutely no interest in other people. I can never relate to anyone, everyone in the world just seems so different from me that there's no way a connection can happen.

I will never forgive the fucked up piece of shit individuals that raised these kids that tormented me. They got to torment me and stunt my personality so badly to the point it might as well not exist, I don't know how to be a person.

I don't have any social interests and the interests I do have I hold so closely to myself, never showing them to anyone as not to be beaten down again. In the past when I've gone to clubs and events I never got to know anybody or share anything with anybody because my mind doesn't know how.

I fucking hate the people who did this to me so badly, it wasn't fucking fair I was just a kid I didn't do anything to anyone but they picked me and ruined me. Bullying is such a scourge on society the world would be better off if they just all fucking died.

I don't know what to do anymore, no therapist has been able to help me want to be around people and actually be able to do so successfully. I want to be wanted and be part of something, but being around people is just so fucking painful, I basically never go outside anymore.

Edit: Thanks for your comments everyone, I didn't expect to get this much attention with this post, it kinda got overwhelming but I'm not going to delete it, since it's useful."	EnglishInfix	post	23.630788682656956	male	White	0.9968242645263672	na	na	na	81	socialanxiety

"children are brutal. I was bullied by my long time friend group all the way through high school and I'm still so wildly damaged from it. I was in the same situation as you for the longest time and I needed to go through some intense ego death before I could start to rebuild myself. Reading some books on recovering from trauma really helped me get started on that (read ""A History of Present Illness"" by Anna Deforest). What also helped was allowing myself to explore and love things on my own without having to worry about what other people would see/think. I really got into playing guitar and making dumb sounds, making messes with charcoal and ink, just putting my toes in the grass and standing in the rain.

"I know how you feel. I was bullied by my family. So no matter how many times we moved or switched schools I was still being bullied in my own home by my siblings and abusive parents. I couldn't escape. I ended up becoming a hermit. I only went to school and went to my room because that was the only place I felt safe. I ended up joining the marine corps and leaving my family for 5 years and have very minimal contact with them until I got out and they basically begged me to come back home. At this point I had forgotten all about the abuse and torment I endured as a kid there. But as I continued to live there things would trigger certain feelings and I would lash out and hide away. I was so confused as to why I was feeling these feelings and became more and more depressed and anxious around my family to the point where I just never left my room. I began meditating and searching for meaning to my feelings. I started sorting through my feelings and assigned names and time stamps in my head of my life time line as to why I might be feeling depression or random quirks of mine. (Ie. I'm a very quiet person. I never understood why until I remembered how my parents would slap me across the face if i ever annoyed them from talkimg too much, i learned that not talking will keep me from getting hit) Once I felt I had a good grasp on my feelings I tried bringing it up to my family and all I heard was ""I don't even remember that"" that hurt me deeply. So I decided to deal with these emotions myself and let them know slowly but surely to remind them what they did to me. So far they feel horrible cuz I will bring up certain shitty aspects of their behavior that I won't tolerate anymore.

This is what I discovered. 
1. People change. My parents and siblings are different people now. I certainly am not the same scared little boy I was. You will not always be the same either. Change comes whether we like it or not. Actively trying to change may feel hopeless but slowly things will start to feel different and slowly you will start to feel better, only if you work on your self awareness.

2. Holding on to these horrible feelings is like holding on to a sword with no handle and a sharpened tang. The harder you grip onto it the more damage you will cause yourself. Hanging on to these feelings causes you to make you wish that everyone who harmed you would be better off dead. These people have families and people who love them. Instead of wishing death upon people, move on. Let go of revenge and work on yourself. It's long painful process. 

3. This pain you feel right now is temporary. It's also a memory. Keep it as a memory in your head, to not forget the lessons this teaches you. Overcoming your pain and trauma induced personality will make you a much stronger and wiser individual. You will hold yourself with more respect. 

You will be ok, live your life through love and kindness. The bullying I endured only turned me into a resilient and kind person. It's the way you direct that energy of change with in yourself. Be cautious with those dark feelings you have, my friend."	EnglishInfix	reply	na	na	na	0.9968242645263672	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"Same here, I was bullied since kindergarten, all throughout my school years, high school, college, etc, by different people with no connection between them, even at a damn english course I took, I quit college and the course because of it, I have no friends (I stopped talking to some because they also bullied me ""low-key"" and other because I pushed them away), I ended a relationship 4 years ago and I haven't dated anyone since, just hang but nothing that I was interested in or that lasted more than a week, I'm drifting apart from family too because they keep talking about my life like they're lives are better, maybe at some degree they're have better lives but messy, so I talk to my parents, like 2 or 3 cousins and a few aunts and uncles, I barely talk to my brother or his wife because they like to talk shit about others including me so, I don't need that, I don't have a stable job, just sell stuff independently but it's not really good and also that because I have social anxiety and it come back again to bullying, so shit sucks rn.

"this is exactly how it is for me but i’m 20. no friends, no social life. i cant relate to anyone and i’m so behind. never had a partner mainly because no one has ever loved me, not sure how to talk to socialise anymore. i find it hard to pick up social cues and tell if someone is flirting with me, i’m extremely awkward too. it doesn’t help with the anxiety getting way worse now that i’m older and me being more isolated. i’ve never felt more depressed

i also got bullied during school for my appearance and personality, everyone called me annoying. everyone hated me. it’s really changed the way i see myself. i feel so much more insecure. i developed an eating disorder because of it all and 5 years later still struggling. genuinely hate life so much"	EnglishInfix	reply	na	na	na	0.9968242645263672	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"I had a similar experience. Horrendous bullying, absolutely no-one in my life to turn to, completely alone, believing what they said; absolutely worthless.  Chronic social anxiety for most of my life, and still now it's there.

The first step for me was learning to love myself again.  Maybe that's not been a problem for you; in which case I'm not sure what the followup step is.  But all the shit they made me believe; I go through it - and try to get perspective on it.  Is it true? Is it real?  If it's not real, then I have to remind myself that, any time the thought crosses my mind.  If it is a real thing; then no matter how bad it is: then I learn to accept that about myself, and see it as a unique part of myself, and something that I shouldn't hate.

Imagine your younger self had you from today around back then.  What would you say to your younger self? How would you treat them, how would you make them feel better, about all the bad things you think about yourself?

I don't think it's possible to be around other people successfully, if you can't connect with yourself, or want yourself.  Put all your effort there.  For some people, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy helps with that kind of negative self image.  


Whoever you are, there is value there. Even if it's not of the type that conforms to being a social person.  You have gone through trauma, and bad things.  You know what you needed there: you probably have some tools to help others in that scenario (whether that's through mentoring, or a youth group).  Perhaps it's too early for that - and you need to focus on yourself first. But find that value which you already have.  However small you decide that is; focus on the areas you believe you have value, and cherish that - love that. If you don't think you have any; then try to recognise that you're wrong (that's not true for anyone); meditate on it, search out the areas you have value; try to look at it objectively.  Build yourself up.  Talk to yourself in your head, how you wish someone would have talked to you when you were young.

It took me years of work to build up some esteem & love for myself.  It came in time.

If connection with people is what you want, then that will come too.  Work on yourself, and put yourself in situations where you're more likely to meet the kind of people you'd get on with.   Perhaps that's in a situation where the social-pressure is low (where there's an activity / distraction)."	EnglishInfix	reply	na	na	na	0.9968242645263672	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
I hear you OP 😢what you described sounds like something much bigger than social anxiety— could even be some form of PTSD…	EnglishInfix	reply	na	na	na	0.9968242645263672	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"  I hear ya. Nothing but empathy for you, I feel that pain. I got bullied right around that time when you become self-aware. Like 10-12. I spent the next several years trying so hard to be cool and have friends and be popular and all that shit, I ended up making choices that completely fucked my life off and I am still getting right. I thought about how they treated me everyday for years. I didn’t know who I was. I had hella bad social anxiety and still do (but it’s gotten better). Terrified of the opposite sex. I really just hated myself for being so awkward and I blamed my parents for not teaching me to be more confident. I still deal w all this stuff btw but this last year or so has kind of helped me begin reframing all this shit.

   So on one hand, some people did something to put a dent in your life, a real injury, and I have nothing but compassion for you and whatever you went through. The biggest shock for me into my 20s is the amount of pain. I thought I’d have my childhood trauma in order by now. I thought I would have had countless sexual escapades, I thought I would be so self sufficient and confident and life would be like a 90’s teen movie. But for the most part it has been really depressing and lonely and stressful. 

   What I have discovered in the last 6 months is that you gotta learn to be okay with yourself, and life will not go the way it should, but it can still be worthwhile, and it will get better. 

  You have value. You have likable qualities. You have interests. You’re obviously smart going off how you composed your post. Everyone has reasons to be confident. I don’t care who it is. Stand on that. There is more to life than the things that happened in the past. I am not telling you to “just get over it” as if thats just something we do in an instant. But I am sure that there is choice involved in moving forward, but not in the same sense as choosing to open a door and walk outside. It’s more like saying “yes” to whatever may be required in the coming months/years in order to grow.

  Idk if this is applicable to your situation, but I had some of relief over a traumatic event in my life because the person called me after years of silence, unaware that I was so affected by what they did and I basically said “fuck you” and sat on the phone for 3 hours explaining to them how their actions fucked me up and changed the way I look at life and i’ve never been the same again and I realized that they had no idea and I hated somebody for something they did when they were 18 and it tortured me for 7 years. And I am still mad at them, honestly. But there’s a lot of relief there compared to before that.

  You said you’re never going to forgive these people. And I understand that. But for me, not forgiving people that wronged me made me an hateful ass person and I woke up miserable every single day and on the inside I had a big anger and jealousy problem and everything made me hate everyone else. 

    My life was hard, I was treated unfairly, it wasn’t resolved, I had a low self esteem, I felt like I missed out on my teenage/adult life because I got traumatized from bullying, all of that is true, but I grew up and became a complete piece of shit because I was so hateful over it. 

   If you aren’t willing or ready to forgive, find a way to gain a new perspective so you aren’t crushed by it, but one day forgiveness will be necessary for YOUR maximum benefit.

  Also, if your outlook is not serving it’s purpose anymore than change everything. Anything and everything. 


TLDR: Nurture yourself. Its not too late. Not one bit. Completely change everything if your outlook is a crux. You’re gonna have to soul search. Find more ways to look at your life, with someone who was there if practical. Get these thoughts out. I am so sorry that this happened to you I have nothing but love for you and your situation this is just some of what helped me the last 6 months.

i’m so so sorry that you had to go through that. i went through something similar. when i was younger i was bullied by my best friends bc of my social and generalized anxiety (i didn’t know that i had anxiety disorders then). ofc it just had to escalate from emotional abuse to physical abuse, and after that i had to go to therapy and i still do. i don’t remember it that well bc my mind blocked it out and i was pretty young. but, i still very much feel the pain from it. some things that have helped me cope with it, even if it’s just a little, are writing (specifically poems bc you can write them in a few minutes) and helping others (probably online tho bc people irl terrify my). i hope you find a way to cope/overcome your trauma in any way. but, remember that healing can take a long time, so please try to take care of yourself. idk if that helps at all, alas, i wish you the best of luck! 💕💕	EnglishInfix	reply	na	na	na	0.9968242645263672	strong	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

Getting new friends on my college course helped until they became more distant, then my gf left and now I have a mediocre job, 2 or 3 good friends, a girl I like but can't talk to and a severely crippled social life(non existent)

I feel very similar to you. I was bullied for a variety of reasons growing up and I have such an intense hatred now for bullying and any form of emotional abuse. It got worse when I was about 25 in the workplace where I was being berated and harassed by my coworkers. Management did nothing about the abusive behavior which reminded me of the helplessness I felt about my teachers who also did nothing about bullying. There was always an audience to my bullying and the people in charge did nothing. I now do not trust authority figures, groups of any kind, or even my own family.

"Hi, I was bullied a lot from ages 11 to 31 for being ""ugly"".  The bullying was mostly insults (public humiliation) from strangers.  As a result, I didn't progress much in my career field, and I have few friends because of my poor self esteem and social skills.  (When many, many people treat you like you're worthless, you will eventually believe them, and it takes a long, long time to get past that feeling.)  Also, years later, I would randomly have flashbacks of some of the bullying incidents, and because of my anxiety, I would obsess over a flashback until it ruined my whole day.

Finally in my 40s, I decided to address my social anxiety.  For two years, I saw a therapist whose preferred technique was CBT.  It helped somewhat, but the results seemed limited because the threrapy didn't address the source of the social anxiety (past bullying), and I was still susceptible to flashbacks sinking my mood for a whole day or two.  Now I'm seeing a therapist who specializes in trauma.  We're using the EMDR technique to reprocess some of my most hurtful memories.  It has taken the pain out of the memories we've discussed.  The therapist says we won't have to process all the bad memories; after we process a few of them, it might change how much the other similar memories are able to affect me.

"I'm sorry for what happened to you. Bullying destroys people. I fortunately got bullied to a much lesser degree in my life (getting cast out, made fun of, etc.). It was still a painful experience for me though and, as you also mentioned made my self esteem be at rock bottom. But eventually I overcame it by doing something so absurd and irrational that I never even thought about it before. I forgave them. I forgave everyone who called me names, cast me out and made me feel lonely. Not for their sake but for my own. If you keep that hate inside of yourself you will always be thinking about your bullys and they will live in your head rent free. Chances are most of these bullys don't ever remember that fondly what they did and have realized that they were just a bunch of insecure assholes. Even if they didn't you should let go because they are no longer part of your life. Once I let go of that anger and hate I could focus on what was in front of me and became a lot more positive and productive.

I feel like when you get excluded to a certain point it has basically the same effects of bullying because you can't really fully develop social skills properly when most interactions go negatively - whether that's being ignored or someone being an asshole doesn't really matter, if every social interaction is bad when you're a kid it's hard to improve anything, and then it feels like you're constantly trying to catch up but you can't really unless you get lucky with that group of super accepting chill friends which is pretty rare.

"Oh god, we had the same childhood. I grew up in a tiny-ass Texas town where the only things that mattered were football, Jesus, conformity, and more football. I wasn't cut out for any of those things. I was a little shrimp of a kid throughout elementary and most of junior high and a complete nerd. I got bullied relentlessly by those backward fuckwits. Even teachers, coaches, MY OWN DAD, and other random adults piled on.

I'm almost twice as old as you OP and don't want you to make the same mistake I did. Don't wait until your 50 before you start getting therapy and taking meds for it.

seek therapy specifically with a trauma specialist or look into healing from c-ptsd. i relate to you a lot and it took literal years with my therapist to unravel the fact that i have trauma and my inner child needed healing. it's been so fucking difficult to even realize that bullying is traumatic to this extent. you have the ability to heal from this. you have the ability to feel confident and secure in yourself and others. you have the ability to make genuine connections. there are people out there that will love you for yourself. pls dont give up on yourself. ♡	EnglishInfix	reply	na	na	na	0.9968242645263672	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"I feel like I could have written this if it wasn't for some minor differences.

As far back as I can remember I was always ""that weird kid"" but to me everyone was weird so I didn't and still don't understand how exactly I am different I just know I am.
Every school I went to I was bullied at, even in college I was bullied, there always seems to be a reason for people to be arseholes to me and I've never understood what I do wrong.

This has resulted in me being just awful at socializing most of the time, there are times where I feel like I'm doing it right but most of the time I'm just kicking myself after the interaction because I said some stupid shit in an attempt to fill the silence.

I like to get out of my flat and go for walks and whatnot but every time I go out I end up feeling depressed because I see people talking and spending time with other people and it seems to effortless to them when I struggle to even strike up a conversation with people let alone develop any form of relationship.

I just feel so broken, I want to be with people but i find it so stressful to be around people because I just don't know what to say most of the time and I always feel like it's up to me to lead a conversation, no one ever seems interested in talking to me and getting to know me, I was once told that my conversational tactic of asking questions to prompt conversations comes across as robotic and I don't know how to handle that.

"You're not alone <3

I was bullied from K-10 and it only stopped because I changed schools/school districts. 

I'm 34 now and I still have nearly an impossible time simply talking to others. Im convinced everyone hates me or thinks I'm stupid. Rejection is damn near a death sentence for my motivations to socialize or make friends, and making friends is difficult because I just want so badly to belong that I'm easily manipulated even after all these years. 

I take solace in knowing that human beings suck and humanity is a cancer that consumes anything different and unique and shits it out ""normal"".

I'll play no part in such machinations and you should have pride in knowing you're one of the few human beings on this planet who possess empathy while so many others go around consuming and destroying for their own petty selfish gains or just for dark entertainment. 

You are 1000x better than the bullies, even it doesn't feel like it. You're likely someone who sees the world differently and you live in a world of average people happy with mediocrity and so controlled by their definition of normal that they stifle themselves and their happiness and who they really are, sacrificing it all for image and status, ending up alone and suicidal and divorced wondering what went wrong, in a society that encourages making stupid fucking decisions for the worst reasons. 

You may not feel it now, but you're above all that shit, especially since you've witnessed just how pointlessly cruel our beastial species is its vast majority. In a world where people only think of themselves, you asked why and the world didn't like it. 

My recommendation as someone who survived bullying and suicide attempts; do what makes you happy. Fuck what everyone else says and do the things that make your life worth living, most people are too miserable to live the lives they truly want. 

For what it's worth, talk therapy didn't work for me either - therapist literally told me ""idk how to help you"" which essentially killed my trust in talk therapy. However, I will say that bullying results in a lot of mental dilemmas that can develop, and sometimes it can help to just treat those feelings.

I still struggle with self worth issues and self loathing because of bullying but I take meds to help balance the imbalance caused by a mood disorder caused by years of trauma, abuse and bullying. Not saying it's the be all end all, but at least it helps me think rationally or clearly and keeps me from jumping to extreme conclusions like ""I deserve to die because I have no friends."" Not saying it'll be 100% what you need because everyone is different.. but I spent like 25 years not wanting medication, believing that meds were not going to change the fact that I'm a loser. But it does because it makes you realize you're not a loser, people are just bad and you were caught in the middle, at no fault of your own.

I'd also recommend finding support groups because you can talk to others who experienced the same rather than some medical professional who likely may never have experienced bullying in their entire lives. Whatever you do, just keep on living. Prove all those mother fuckers wrong and turn yourself into an unstoppable force fueled by your struggle."

"I get the urge every so often to go outside a bit. I can't walk properly and have a hard time relaxing, and I limit my ""walk"" to just going from A to B then back home after an hour or so.

Too scared to look people passing by in the eyes, very anxious of people judging what I wear, how I walk, what I'm doing, where I'm going. I hate passing by groups of friends because I'm jelous and intimidated (and they're most likely to laugh at something my mind thinks is about me).

Listening to earphones makes it better but if someone is curious to what I'm listening I'll be anxious they judge my music taste, and I can't just constantly listen to music.

Going out with a friend makes me more confident and it feels like a real walk but I'm really awkward in talking and easily run out of subjects (then it's silent and cringe).

"I'm a socially anxious person, and the thought of interviews and public speaking scares me to death. I get so nervous and my brain turns into survival mode when I'm under people's judging eyes and attention. By survival mode i mean that incase i do work up the courage to speak instead of staying frozen, i put on this facade. I try to say and be what they expect me to say and be...in a way. 

And that is the worst thing you could do for an interview. Because they want you to be real. They want to see how your approach and attitude is. I want myself to be real as well. So badly. Yet under pressure, i put up a front. I'm both too honest (because im a fair person, i find it hard to lie with many things) and dishonest (because im an anxious people-pleaser who fears judgement) at the same time. And the way to get better at things is to practice, but you dont get to practice interviews like that. Its a tight spot you can only be in when you are there. 

I recently blew an interview and has lost my confidence. I have confidence in my own abilities for the course yet I'm unable to show it through an my words and body language in an interview.

I hate how unfair it all is. 
Interviews are supposed to be a pressure test. I get that. Yet the pressure test affects different people differently and hence isnt fair. Some people are naturally confident, some are not. And that confidence says about their confidence only (and definitely thats a good thing) , and not their depth of talent for that course/job (if they can communicate that well and truthfully too, thats great).

"At least you made it to the interview. Don’t be so hard on yourself. That takes a lot of guts and determination for anyone let alone us.

Some people literally couldn’t open their mouth to utter a few words out at all. 

You seem very insightful and aware. That’s key. Rather be you than the ignorant home body that doesn’t try.

Listen: think through where you went wrong, what triggered it. and a few things you can do to help work on avoiding that recurring. Some really useful and easy to remember CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy):

- When you enter a room look left to right and examine the whole room. Don’t be afraid to look at them or whatever it is, first. It’s okay it’s not like you’re gonna mean mug them for an hour even if they do look at you that very same moment. While you’re doing this it’s imperative to do some deep breathing. That way you know what’s there and kind of take the wrapper off the present. I’m having a hard time wording it but do you know that feels that you (us freaks hah) always get after social gatherings or whatever events that you were killing yourself thinking about and imagining every last thing that could go wrong? What do you remember feeling after nearly every single one? Lot of relief. Realizing wow this isn’t so bad after all. Yet somehow you still have the same feelings over and over and over again. I feel like the full 180 degree turn with a deep breath or two is kind of like reverse engineering that feeling while you’re in the moment. You know what to say. You know how to say it. You know what’s right and what’s wrong. You understand very well that your mind is playing tricks on you and you almost know how too. Yet you continue to let it happen. Intercept those intrusive thoughts. You can do this don’t give up. Not for another 100 interviews you better not. You owe yourself that much. You seem very well spoken among a handful of other very desirable properties. You can and you WILL get better. Whatever it didn’t go your way this time - their loss. They didn’t see past what they needed very much so.

- Also another good one, is doing mental math. Idk what your mental math capacity is like but essentially any time at all that you’re not talking, and during any time where you can just smell those thoughts brewing in your mind : start multiplying numbers by themselves. It’s very easy and keeps your brain distracted somewhat forcefully because you need that RAM (computer reference for anyone who doesn’t know, the lore RAM a computer/device has the more things it can do at once) to do the math in your head. You’re going to be too mentally busy to worry about things that aren’t accurate or realistic and letting them distract you from what you woke up to get done. So it goes like this anc you can change it ofc to your liking but my go to is simply multiplying numbers by themselves. 1 times 1 is 1. 2x2 is 4. Once you’re in the double digits it gets pretty hard and might distrust you a little too much, if so just restart at one and rinse and repeat. I guess a good analogy for this method is it’s like a fidget toy for your brain.

There’s a few more I’m sure you can find online but IMO there’s no need to have a bunch. If anything you won’t remember them. Picking a couple that work for you is the best approach in my opinion. It’s super easy to remember too. Look around/breathe and multiply numbers by themselves.

Sorry for being so thorough I just really do get where you’re coming from to the point that I can’t follow my own advice. I wish I could but it’s always so hard and much easier said than done. Please do message me anytime if you want to talk about how things are going. Maybe we can help each other who knows. I’m pathetic anyways I use crutches and things to help get by. I wish I had half the will you do.

Either way I hope you find your confidence again soon"	Asterwoolf	reply	na	na	na	0.9989892840385437	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"OP, I used to feel and behave the exact same way in interviews. My best coping method is this:
Pretend you don’t care. Pretend you don’t need the job. In fact, apply for jobs you don’t need or want so you can interview for those as practice. I have convinced myself that I don’t need a job that doesn’t want me for who I am. You know that question, “tell me your greatest weakness?” I now tell them that I have crippling anxiety and over analyze situations, and that can be distracting, but that it gives me pressure to deliver my best and an analytical mindset for problem solving. I usually start by saying “I thought about how I might answer this and I feel like it’s 2023 and we can be honest about our mental health.” They appreciate the honesty. 

If you are looking for a “cure,” one thing that has helped me greatly is a small dose of metoprolol or any beta blocker. It’s not a regular medication for me, just something I use before interviews and exams. I keep it handy for if I ever start panicking and can’t get anything done too. It controls the physical anxiety for me, so the heart flutters and the pit in my stomach and the dry mouth and shaky voice. I do highly recommend giving it a shot, but my #1 recommendation is to apply for some jobs you don’t want at all or know you’re overqualified for and use them as practice. It’s okay to do that."

"I have an idea for you. You ever seen any of those prank videos on YouTube? They have some where they prank interviews... so they go to an interview for a job and say absolutely everything wrong trying to get the best rejection reaction.

When I was younger I always would prank to soothe my anxiety. 

So why not set up a few practice interviews for jobs you are not trying to get hired at and just try to relax and practice interviewing"	Asterwoolf	reply	na	na	na	0.9989892840385437	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"If it's any consolation, I experience this from the other side.  I interview people for jobs & feel pressure to represent my company in a good way- I don't want to come off as too weird, or too formal, etc.etc.  Interviews go in both directions.  You're being judged, but you're a judge too.

But a good interviewer knows that some people are smoother than others.  With a little experience, you can spot someone who's overconfident & full of shit.  You can spot someone who's anxious & tripping over themselves.  They should be interviewed differently & judged differently, because the real goal is to hire someone who's good for the job, regardless of how they present themselves.

I say all this to say: if you're struggling with the interview, just do the best you can.  A half-way decent interviewer will understand & won't think less of you because of it.  They'll do their best to look past your presentation.  And a shitty interviewer probably means a shitty company- you can do better."

I'm not sure mental math would be my way to go. Since i really need to be present and alert, i think that'd distract me.

"I see people being so comfortable mingling and talking to each other, while I have nobody to talk to. I'm so anxious that even the people who do feel like talking to me, I reply to them abruptly to end the conversation as soon as possible so that I don't say anything stupid, or simply because I can't think of anything witty to say. People think I'm an arrogant piece of shit. 

I feel like a loser - that I don't have networking skills at all and I can't mix up with even my own colleagues.

A friend of mine joined my company quite later than me and at this point he is way more popular than me. I think I'm hopeless.

I eat alone, go to the breakout room alone and just feel tortured all the time by the thought that people would be thinking ""look at that haughty weirdo, she's alone again"".

"I think you should try to hold those conversations which you mentioned you normally avoid. People like us have only two options the way i see it - one is be comfortable with exactly who we are and take on the ""i dont care"" attitude and not let others and their judgements affect us. You do need this either way but sometimes just this wont do. 

Because humans are social creatures, social acceptance affect us a lot. If thats the case - the second option - we gotta exert and push ourselves. I know it sounds unfair - not having the ability to communicate and get along well yet being affected by it so easily. Talk about contradiction right? I've thought a lot about how unfair it is as well. Still do. But theres no other way out but through. 

If you're feeling bad about it everyday, you might as well try making a difference in your social status right? Maybe at the end of the day you'll be overthinking and criticising yourself over everything you said and did. But thats where you gotta stop. The overthinking is where you have to make yourself understand its unnecessary. People arent gonna remember everything you said or did. They arent judging you the way you think they're judging you at all. If you keep conversing and getting along, thats what they'd remember. 

Along with that, one thing you have to make sure is that you dont lose yourself. You have to be confident about who you are and let others see exactly that. Not every person might understand you, so keep only the people who do. You dont have to chase popularity (you mentioned your friend's status). Different people are good at different things. You have your own uniqueness. It just doesnt happen to be your social skills. But maybe his is. So you shouldnt compare yourself to him. 

I stated all this from what i learned through my own experience. I've gone through it. The fear of judgements, the anxiety, overthinking, neuroguilt, worthlessness. I still have my difficulties but there are many parts of it I've learned to overcome. So I'm telling you its possible. You can get there. Don't give up.

"How was your first day? I know it’s extremely uncomfortable, but I suggest taking the mask off if it’s not for health purposes. it creates a barrier between you and other people and gives the impression that you’re a less approachable person, at least in my opinion.

one of the main causes of anxiety, in my experience, is low self esteem. who is telling you that you’re ugly? has anyone outright said it? if you’re the only one that has told you that, then you have the power to change that mindset. alternatively, I think there are plenty of unattractive people who have a lot of friends. people won’t value you for your appearance if you don’t let them.

"Genuine question. People keep telling me to do therapy regarding my mental health issues (I also have depression and possibly ADHD). I’ve met with 3 different ones in the past few years, having weekly sessions for about 2-3 months with each. I know that may not be a long time but none gave me any insight I haven’t seen on Reddit or read in a self help book.

I understand I have a chemical imbalance in my brain. I learned grounding techniques that (sometimes) help when my anxiety spikes or when I get a dissociative episode. I know what my main triggers are.

For example, I have agoraphobia and being in crowds or work meetings makes me nervous because I worry I’m going to have a panic attack and be embarrassed about it (setting off a super fun cycle of me fighting off panic about feeling panicked). I know what’s wrong and can mostly talk myself down so a full blown panic attack hasn’t happened yet. How will a therapist help me more in this case?"

I feel similarly about one on one conversations. I don't mind being in a small group where i can blend in and only have to speak when I actually have something to say, but having to carry half of a conversation feels like a death sentence. Unfortunately although I can relate, I don't have much advice. I still hate talking with most people one on one unless I know them very well.

I know people who are in relationships that watch it so that's not entirely true. I don't think it would cause anxiety but if you are single and socially anxious then you probably wouldn't have an alternative. So the two going together isn't at all surprising.

"Also im very sorry about what u described in the first message at the top....

Yeah but men like it. Usually porn is watched almost only by men and rarely some women but the ratio is very different I'd say. 

Yeah its horrible, I also was a guy viewing women as just sexual objects, either bad (not good looking) or good, or very good. But girls I actually talked to IRL and weren't mean to me or anything I didnt picture them as sexual objects. But intrusive thoughts sometimes got in my head....

Yeah i know what you meant I understood it I just said my POV of the entire thing. Porn isn't real, when u have real sex, its so much more boring and less enjoyable. I was so desoerate to try it because EVERY guy says how ""I f**ked 3 girls last fee weeks, it was so good"" literally every guy, ever. Meybe if you truly love someone it can be nice but with random girls u dont know, good looking or not, its not enjoyable almost at all if u won't connect with them. Idk how enjoyable it is for a woman in the same situation but I dont think a foreign object in your intimate area is very comfortable... Could be for some meybe .... Im not a woman...

"Thanks for saying that (about my experience).
Even if I never did it. Idk if it's boring or how it's compared to porn. In my opinion, theoretically, it has to be better with a person you actually like or even love. Also, from what I've heard, the first times are almost always bad for both genders. 
It probably will get better. Also, I would advise you not to watch porn as it gives you false expectations, and you'll be disappointed by the real thing, but if you don't intend to have real sex then watch it.
I get it that guys have this pressure to sleep with many girls to prove themselves. But you can see beyond that and not conform to these norms. There's more to life than sleeping with a bunch of women.

So many people betrayed me and lost my trust and me being the extremist I am immediately just blocked them. Went from a few dozen down to one or two and my girl friend and now I’m single and that one friend robbed me for $280,000. Don’t believe me I couldn’t care less. 

I really really hate sounding like a victim even if I am one in a scenario. I just can’t stand it. I don’t ask anyone for help even when I need it badly.

So sick of people and how stupid the average person is and how untrustworthy humans have been to me in this life but this is no way to live. Money doesn’t mean much when you have nobody to share it with. When obnoxious loud groups of friends pass by my lonely self at the mall, it burns. So so bad. That used to be me. Im so jealous inside and I causally just walk by. All the girls double looking me. What good is it IF I CANT FUCKING APPROACH THEM!?!? They make it blatantly obvious at the gym they will be working out next to me, then I’ll move and they will too and will be right next to me somehow, on the other side of the gym. THEN THEY DO IT AGAIN. A third time. Meanwhile looking at me frequently and making eye contact any chance they get. But what do I do? NOTHING. It fucking destroys me. 

This is no way to live. In California with a bunch of material and designer clothes and cars and Rolex and this and that you name it. It’s all mud without someone to share it with. All mud. Relationships are true wealth and I learned that the hard way. Whether you can relate or not, I’d really appreciate someone to talk to. It was my birthday the other day and iykyk. They are brutally sad. I believe life can turn around I’ve seen it happen it’s just my anxiety is holding me hostage. If you wanna talk or text: message me. Would really enjoy some company right now.

java is always pc. server ip mc.classicsurvival.net you start at a hub and teleport randomly with the commands offered to avoid getting rolled by experienced players when starting your adventure because they like killing noobs for fun. So essentially, you need to run as far away as you can from these guys, collect gear that takes months to prepare and fight back. Most of the preparing is immersive. you have to risk your life finding diamonds in caves, be careful with lava. RN, the most used combat tool is not the sword, bows, nor shields. Its explosives.

"I have high-functioning autism. I had to self-harm myself out of the social anxiety I developed (destructive stims included hitting myself, biting the skin around my fingers and my cheeks, etc.). This and a lot of effort had allowed me to overcome my social anxiety to the point that I am now able to go up to and talk to everyone. I highly recommend not using self harm or destructive stimming to overcome social anxiety. Pls do not do this. Despite it, I was so happy I was now able to go up and talk to women. Although, this is only half the story.....

You see, I still am VERY socially underdeveloped despite being a 20 year old male. I have the social skills of a 12 year old. At work I was infantilised and treated like a puppy with a borken leg. Women literally lecture me about acting ""immature"". I used to think that maybe it was coz I was so ugly (I mean i am short, balding, fat, etc.) but I realised it wasnt so much the ugliness, it was just my autistic traits. INfodumiping about my special interest. Not showing eye contact properly. Making weird or outrageous remarks, etc. 

The general clinical advice of ""unmasking"" is extremely naive and unrealistic. Sure, you might find those wonderful people who will love you despite your unmasked, autistic true personality, but most neurotypicals will hate you. 

My point is, not only do you have to overcome social anxiety if you have hgh functioning autism, you also have to catch up on teh yeras of social development that you have missed out on due to the horrendous bullying you probably suffered during school which forced you into introversion and developing an avoidant personality.

"The closest I've found to such a book is *A Field Guide to Earthlings*, or maybe *How to Handle Neurotypicals*.  I wouldn't say either's filled with much simple, actionable advice, and I'm not sure if such advice is actually possible to dispense, alas.

Probably the most insightful book I've read about how to be polite (a lot of which is pretty much masking advice) is *Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usage*, which you can borrow for free at the Internet Archive.

The thing is, I'm not sure how much you can consciously learn things like ""how to drop your own hints, and how to spot other people's hints"", as not only is it very context-specific, and something allistic people spent their whole lifetime refining their ability to do, but they don't even do it consciously, freeing them up to think about other things.

As far as infodumping goes, find people in forums online who share that particular enthusiasm and infodump with people who reciprocate it.

You can fake eye contact by looking at the bridge of the nose instead, if that's not itself overwhelming for you.  Look there for a few seconds, look away for a few seconds, repeat.  But that makes it harder to pay attention to the actual conversation, a problem allistic people don't have because they're making eye contact unconsciously.  The same applies to facial expressions, tone of voice, and other pragmatics.

I think the most successful strategy I've heard of from others is to ask people about themselves and let them do the dumping.  Ask followup questions, and keep it light.  They'll love you for it."	Business_Window_6232	reply	na	na	na	0.9409604668617249	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

- Try to sit in a calm place and with a wall behind you so you dont feel observed by behind and can see around you so your brain says to itself its safe.
>If possible, try to go sit outside so you can have fresh air and dont feel like in a cage.

- Dont take a too big meal and easy to digest.

"My boyfriend (24M)  and I (23F) have been together three years now. He is really extroverted, can easily be around people, always says something interesting, is funny, the center of attention. I am totally different, I have severe social anxiety, I'm always anxious because of other’s opinions and about saying something wrong or being boring. He can't understand how am I functioning. Whenever we are in a group I can't even speak a single word even if I tried, because he is always leading the conversation. I feel like I can't even get a space when he is there. We already live together and a few friends of mine are coming to visit us. Since we live far away this would be my only opportunity to connect with them. My problem is that I can't even be with my friends when he is there, because he is always trying to impress them, deep talk with them, be funny, get to know them closer. Honestly, I am afraid my friends will start liking him more than me. Recently, he just asked out one of my friends for a coffee just to get to know her better and she told him things about herself which I didn't even know about. I sound like I am possessive and jealous and probably I am. But I only have a few friends and would like to be around them freely but can't if he is always there and being the center of attention. It's just sad that my only friends are also liking and enjoying his company more than mine.

"Have to spoken to him about this and how you feel? Is there no way you can just say, “is it okay if you help me when we’re in these situations” and ask if he can give you a platform to speak?

I completely understand how you feel, not wanting to say the wrong with or say something wrong. 

If you feel like you can’t even speak to your friends when he’s there I would say that’s a bit of an issue- the asking her out for a coffee is also a bit odd. I personally don’t think that’s very appropriate but that’s an outsiders opinion.

Your friends should also like you for you and nothing should change that.

I think you need to discuss how you feel with him if you haven’t already, he should be there to support you."	Littlebird5689	reply	na	na	na	0.9990379810333252	weak	no	strong	na	socialanxiety
"I overthink and microanalyze an interaction then i start hating myself for saying and doing dumb things then it always turns out that it was never a big deal and i was just making a problem out of nothing. Then another crisis will come and it's like i never learn. I keep doing the same shit over and over again thinking that, ""my worries might actually be forreal this time"". I wanna stop being like this i really do but whenever my anxiety overwhelms me it's like i have no control over my brain anymore. In my head, negative thoughts = absolute truth. When friends assure me that nothing's wrong i rarely believe them. I dont wanna sabotage future friendships anymore and i wish im a shameless extrovert because im really sick and tired of constantly stressing about the littlest things

Edit: a few minutes after i made this post, the thing that i was overthinking and the reason behind this vent turned out to be an imaginary problem again.

"Anxiety is not based on logical thinking. Trust me. Don’t believe everything you think. When your body/mind is anxious, you’re going into flight or fight mode. You’re looking for threats. The body is hyper-alert for any indications of a threat. Your blood vessels tighten. Your breathing quickens. Your heart-rate accelerates. Increase in adrenaline and cortisol. Your body is preparing for threats. Socially anxious people are hypervigilant specifically about rejection from other people. Every little thing can indicate rejection. For whatever reason, something around you or in you has convinced you that people are going to reject you. You are preparing for it before it happens. You are scared of being hurt/rejected by people. 
The way I got rid of my social anxiety? Constant exposure. Do it over and over again. Put yourself in situations to do it over and over again. Even soldiers who are in battle eventually get used to dead bodies around them. What you constantly expose yourself to, becomes your norm. You will become desensitized. 
I chose a career that I would have to be forced to interact with people constantly(nursing) and eventually I just stopped caring. I had to talk to so many people constantly that it was just another day. You find that a lot of other people are awkward, weird too. And the ones that judge you for it are the ones who judge it in themselves. 
This might not be the best option for you, but I smoke weed when I feel tension in my body. The tension i feel impacts how I show up to people. I will be more tense, or have a negative energy about me. So I smoke a little. Not too much, just a little to get the edge off. To reset my nervous system. Get it back to homeostasis. Then I feel relaxed and ready to take on whatever. Sometimes addressing the bodily symptoms (shaking, sweating, palpitations) will change your thoughts too. Deep breathing exercises will reduce your symptoms. When I say deep I mean deeeeep. Breathe in as far as you can, hold as long as you can, breathe out as far as you can. Eventually your heart rate slows, your blood pressure decreases. Yoga/meditation. 
You know you have this social anxiety, and it’s a condition like no other, and with time and careful attention, you can become more comfortable with yourself and in turn with socializing with other people. Don’t judge yourself too hard. Learn from your mistakes, pick up, dust off, and move on. There’s no point in beating yourself up you’re not achieving anything.

Some people might interpret this as a bit of a negative view I guess, but I think the truth is that things do happen or can happen in socialization that are unideal. While one shouldn't overthink things, I also don't see a point on the other hand in pretending unideal interactions never happen. I've observed that social people and extroverts can encounter drama or unideal interactions as part of their socialization. Socializing or being extroverted is not necessarily without its drama, a few people getting annoyed or some discomfort here and there. And I've personally come to the conclusion that to get over social anxiety requires accepting that a bit.	lokingsley	reply	na	na	na	0.9988204836845398	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety
I sort of have this issue too. I'm fully aware of how ridiculous social anxiety is, I know what my biggest problem is, and I know what caused it all in the first place. Yet, I still deal with it despite this knowledge. The only reason I have come up with is that my brain has been dealing with social anxiety for so long now, that it has basically developed a bad habit of it. Meanwhile, the rest of my brain has all this knowledge and awareness of what's going on, but it just can't override the bad habit part of my brain, if that makes sense. I just wish I knew how to get rid of that bad habit.	lokingsley	reply	na	na	na	0.9988204836845398	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"Did you actually get rid of your SA with constant exposure? Or did you find that it was just becoming numb/less affected by it. Because the example you gave of soldiers becoming numb to dead bodies isn’t exactly an ideal state. It’s not addressing the cause of why you’re in a place with so many dead bodies and what you can do to get out of it.

This is how I see the advice to just “constantly expose to fear and face it so many times you become desensitized to it.”

It’s an okay starting point. But ultimately it’s just addressing the symptom and not the cause. Constant exposure is only making you more calloused while the deeper vulnerability which is causing the SA in the first place lives on inside. Which creates the situation where you can’t ever really let up on your exposure practices - your callouses require continual reinforcement so that the tender areas don’t get exposed to the light.

The aim should be to heal the inner weaknesses and tender areas. (Get out of the place with dead bodies.) Then you’re no longer reliant on constant exposure to keep the fear manageable.

Not really specific to you. Just a general thing I see. Constant exposure to keep the fear down is only a bandaid solution, not a permanent fix. The fear may subside, even a lot. But it will always be waiting to surface as soon as your guard is down or you’re in a vulnerable state or you stop your constant exposure practices."	lokingsley	reply	na	na	na	0.9988204836845398	no	no	strong	na	socialanxiety

"I find it's a constant struggle and need to keep finding creative ways to work through new things. But also my surroundings are always changing. Work used to be hard with my SA but I've been there over 10 years now so I do pretty good (my confidence is really high).

I'm open with people that I have SA and I'm finding there are a lot of us and we can stick together. Example: we had a big work celebration and I didn't want to arrive when everyone else was crowding to get there. I said to a coworker who was also hanging back that the scenario made my anxiety go through the roof. He said ME TOO and we hung back and chatted and eventually slipped in later. The rest of the event I felt so much better and now him and I check in with each other, and seek each other out at social work events."	lokingsley	reply	na	na	na	0.9988204836845398	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"Remember everyone is the main character in their own story. Nobody is as aware of your anxiety as you and as long as you're not being bullied or called out, go with the flow.

I find it's a constant struggle and need to keep finding creative ways to work through new things. But also my surroundings are always changing. For example work used to be hard with my SA but I've been there over 10 years now so I do pretty good (my confidence is really high). I have a cool car and truck and love the positive attention, but also love that their icebreakers to conversations.

Another strategy I use is to treat everyone like I know them. I smile at everyone I pass and always say good morning or whatever, like they're someone I am comfortable with.

As I've gotten older I've become more open with people  regarding SA and I'm finding there are a lot of us. I dint necessarily bring it up in casual conversation but if there is an 'event' that makes me anxious I check the mood of those around me and sometimes you can tell who is also feeling anxious. I tell them that these situations make my anxiety go through the roof. So often the answer is ME TOO.

"Yeah I second CBT. I used to have really severe social anxiety and the one thing that helped me was working at altering my thinking patterns. 

I mostly did it myself, with the help of some reading on CBT. But yeah you really have to work at your self-talk and monitor the way you judge yourself and basically hijack that cycle. Try to eliminate self-shaming. 

It can help to have encouragement from friends, but in the end, you really have to become your own encourager. We actually make better cheerleaders for ourselves than others when it comes down to it. Because we are the only ones who really know ourselves and can most accurately judge ourselves. And we actually can be more understanding towards ourselves than anyone else too. 

Once you can do this and stop placing other people's opinions as holding much weight, it can really help you feel stronger. And able to deal with other people's judgement When you place less value on it and learn to rely on yourself for your comfort. Just remember that everyone is different, and not everyone will jive with you. And that's okay if not everyone accepts you as you are.

Got to say that I'm not perfect at this by any means, I'm often still too hard on myself. But, I'm doing so much better today and I couldn't be more thankful about that honestly. Social anxiety is the worst.

Anyway, best of luck to you in your journey. Also, the book that really changed things for me was ""When Panic Attacks"" by David Burns. You can find free PDFs online if you look around."	lokingsley	reply	na	na	na	0.9988204836845398	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
Well yes, that’s a good point. I focused mainly on desensitizing myself to my symptoms. Because I probably do know 90% what initially caused my social anxiety (early childhood situation that happened to me, caused abandonment issues) but my thought process is I can’t change the past, I can talk about it and I can mentally make peace with it, but my body has already stored the trauma.It’s a survival instinct. When we go through something harmful that hurts us, our body/brain rewires to avoid that situation happening again. This is the flight or fight reaction. This is PTSD. While this is kind of our bodies, it’s not logical. Just because someone hurt you when you were a child doesn’t mean it’s going to happen everytime you see someone new. So instead of helping us, it’s limiting us. We can’t lock ourselves up forever, we have to find a way to make peace with our vulnerabilities, then open up again. Get hurt, then open up again. So the only way I know how to do this is to deal with my symptoms. But it is also good to address the root cause, I agree.	lokingsley	reply	na	na	na	0.9988204836845398	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"Nice! It seems like you have a lot of insight into your issues already, which is half the battle. If I can recommend a book: In An Unspoken Voice by Peter Levine. Talks about PTSD/trauma and how it's something that primarily happens in our body - not mind. So treatment needs to be directed to the body.

For me I made the connection that my social anxiety was also based on trauma and events in childhood/adolescence. I tried a lot of conventional approaches (CBT, exposure, exercise, fake it till you make it) but these things only ever scratched the surface of my social anxiety and helped me to ""manage it"" better.

Only when I dealt with the trauma in my body did I start to find a real sense of freedom in my mind.

"Gradually bringing awareness into my body. I was very dissociated from my body, which I learned was my mind keeping me safe and from experiencing the full impact of the traumas I carried. But while it kept me “safe” it also kept the trauma from ever coming up and resolving, so I continually dealt with recurring fears about letting people close and chronically experiencing a low level anxiety in my interactions. 

It was an improved place but I was still stuck in limbo, couldn’t ever relax and let down my guard around others. 

Once I started gradually directing awareness into my body I was able to slowly bring more feeling inside and awaken “frozen” areas where there was a lot of tension and little feeling, areas where I was holding the traumas, trapped emotional energy. 

There are some meditation practices in the book I mentioned. This is a good place to start. I saw the most benefit when I took a 10 day Vipassana retreat. Super intense and hardest thing I’ve ever done but we’ll worth it for how I was able to restore a lot of feeling and energetic flow back inside me. I was able to a lot more comfortably inhabit my body after that. But Vipassana isn’t something I recommend if you’re just starting with body awareness. It’s like psychedelics, it needs a lot of preparation and the right intention going into it, because you’ll be opening up old wounds, which isn’t easy."	lokingsley	reply	na	na	na	0.9988204836845398	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"For the ppl that read this. Ty. U dropped this 👑

Anyways….

Why is that on adderall, I can talk to anyone without over thinking. I can talk to my sister (which I never do. We have an awkward relationship. But when I’m off the addy I talk to her as if everything is normal). I can talk to anyone even if I hate them sober.  Adderall makes me realize im living a life of hate and helplessness and awkwardness. I don’t care ab anything sober. Hate everyone. Myself.  Don’t talk to my own family, I’m just so awkward holy shi. Always avoid small talk. Can’t look anyone in the eyes. But on this addy I feel like talking to everyone, I wanna be a good person, there’s not much overthinking when I’m doing stuff. There’s gotta be a way to feel this sober right? Plz tell me counseling can fix me. I don’t want to have to be taking addys everyday to feel normal.

And Im not gonna sit here an act like idk why adderall makes me feel like this…. It’s a drug that releases dopamine and makes you euphoric and all that shi blah blah blah.

My point is, how is it even possible to only “feel” good like this on adderall. There’s gotta be a way to fix myself permanently right? Its gotta be all in my head. Is it my mindset ? Placebo? If I can feel like this now why can’t I sober ? It just doesn’t make any sense to me. What I just said sounds like bs. But at the same time. I think of it as if I feel like this now. Why can’t I when the pill wears off? Is it scientifically true that it’s impossible for ppl like me to feel normal sober? Do u think I have a chemical imbalance ? And if I do is it fixable? Sorry if these sound dumb. Ik u guys aren’t therapists. I’m working on seeing one just so busy and broke. So for the time being I just want some brief answers. 

And I have rlly bad adhd btw, so I took my friends addys (he gave me a few). I tried to fight the addy. Cuz I rlly didn’t want the truth to be that I can only feel really happy and normal if I take a pill. But here I am. Hate to say it. But it’s reality. I can’t even enjoy this addy because I’m so stuck on the fact that once this is over I’m back to my true self.

Adderall is one molecule away from being methamphetamine. I was on it for a long time. The longer you stay on, the more you will need it later in life. It truly is a powerful stimulants. And as such, your brains dopamine receptors will stretch out to accept the flood of dopamine adderall gives you. The thing is, they don’t always unstretch, or fully go back to normal. I know it sucks hearing negative things about something helping you drastically and I’ve been there. But if I were you, I would take the minimum doses of 10 milligrams per day.

Thanks for sharing this. I was a long time adderall user (never abused it though). And can totally relate to what you are saying. There is no better feeling than that initial flood of warmth that comes over your body when you feel it kicking in. Besides it’s affect on ADHD, adderall makes us feel good because it’s a powerful stimulant. I can take 2 caffeine pills and get that similar feeling of well being. Unfortunately (at least in my circumstance) the effects slowly diminish.  I think my body got used to it and after awhile,  I was just taking it because if I didn’t, I would experience  this soul crushing exhaustion. I was very worried that I would end up being one of those people that always had to take more and more so I eventually  got off adderall altogether. It took months to get over that exhaustion. How long have you been taking adderall? Have you tried other medications? I have yet to find a daily stimulant that my body won’t eventually adapt to.

You sound a bit like an addict. Adderall is heavily over prescribed and there are other ways. Trust me I’ve been on it and I know why your upset at me laying the truth. You don’t want anything coming between you and your high. I used to carry my entire bottle of adderall with me everywhere I went I was like in love with it. But yeah water and meth are two very different things man. And waters conversion to peroxide is very different than adderall conversion to meth.

Can’t believe a junkie is trying to call me an addict. Never taken amphetamines in my life, so your entire argument kind of falls apart, but nice try. Amphetamine is a much less harmful stimulant than methamphetamine.

Actually yeah it does matter. First hand REAL experience is the grounds for the paperwork you have scanned over and cherry picked information to form your argument.

"I recently began an IT internship and I'm unsure about being hired full-time afterward. During my initial one-on-one meeting with my manager, social anxiety affected my communication. I found it difficult to speak, and when I did, my words were unclear. I tried to make a script and it didn’t go as planned. 

 Nervousness also causes me to rush through conversations and give short responses when trainers try to engage with me. I really wish I could interact more effectively with others, and I feel guilty for not being able to engage due to my social anxiety. 

Has anyone experienced something like this? Or have any advice?"	OkPurple3935	post	16.50760346964944	female	White	0.9993991851806641	na	na	na	6	socialanxiety
I can relate as I started my first full time job about a year ago (also IT). I definitely feel like SA has kept me from fully engaging in most conversations, especially in meetings. It’s weird because I want that to change, but I almost feel like I have to keep my outward appearance the same as it’s always been (quiet, reserved). Whenever things get really bad though, I take a few deep breaths and try to separate myself from the thoughts I’m having - I feel like this sort of thing is really undervalued.

I'm a 25M who hasn't had friends since highschool. I tried joining clubs in college to meet people but stopped going after a bit as I realized I didn't fit in. I'm out of college and working now and have pretty much stopped trying, not sure if I have autism or something but I'm just terrible at forming bonds with people, even my sister and parents.

This is me basically. I used to have a small circle of friends from high school but always felt like that one friend that existed on the peripheral, that they would just invite to things out of pity. Plus there's only so many times you get invited to things if you keep saying no. Now the only social interaction I get is at work. It does get pretty lonely sometimes. Sorry I don't have any real advice, but I guess just keep at it and maybe you'll eventually find some people you vibe with.	herivygrows	reply	na	na	na	0.9971675276756287	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"One of the worst parts of social anxiety for me is that once I've acted awkwardly or quiet around someone it becomes harder and harder to act ""normal"" around them. Something as simple as I walked by them one day and didn't say anything, but the next day say hello when they come by. Or if you avoid someone for a long time intentionally or not, it becomes almost impossible to contact them again 

I feel like I should go out and start conversations, but people are put off if you don't talk to them much for a long period of time then suddenly act interested so it becomes harder or impossible to make up for the time where you either didn't talk or acted awkwardly. I know a lot of times people won't care if they want to be friends or whatever but it seems more like people just get weirded out that you suddenly start talking to them.

I feel really bad for how I act to some of the friendly regulars at stores and things like that. I hate when I run into the same workers over and over at grocery stores, fast food, etc and they remember you. I'm not rude or anything but sometimes my anxiety is worse than other times and I just want to get out quick so I won't really say much and they'll try to be friendly but I'm also irritated that they remember me lol I barely said shit why are you remembering me, but just needed to rant."		post	15.952530021088188	male	White	0.9976688027381897	na	na	na	3	socialanxiety

Honestly, even if they would judge you for these so-called social failures, then this is only true within their heads, in their own narratives (and they probably have insecurity issues to sort out).

My advice: once in a while, reverse the roles in your head. Pretend that you have no flaws, and try to spot signs of ""social failures"" from others. You will quickly realise that no one is perfect.

"I've struggled making friends for 30 years. I only have 1 really close friend from college, ill call her Connie. After seeing a therapist and working out some of my negative self thoughts. I've made progress in finding about 3 more friends online and I've been hanging out with them in addition to get much closer to a distant family member. 

Connie has also struggled making friends too, but besides me, she has at least 4 others (who are mostly seperate from eachother) and she's also trying to find more online, but hasn't met with any of them (I get this, it's a lot of work and planning plus its scary). She hangs out with her old friends often, and I am with my new friends often, and we talk to each other, daily, and see eachother pretty often. 

Whenever she asks me about what I've been up too, and I mention a new friend she says that I should invite them over to her house. Whenever, I try to plan something for me and Connie, she says, ""you should bring (new friend)"". This past weekend, she said she wants to plan an outing for her, me, my new friends A, B, and C and my family member. (Who haven't even met her or eachother). She wouldn't be bringing anyone she knows. 

Connie is a very kind, sensitive person (I like to think we are alike here). And I know she dreams of a big group of friends and she deserves that. (I wouldn't completely mind a group if it were more organic). But it seems weird to me that she is so persistent to meet my new friends rather than make her own. Or it seems like she wants me to create that friend group for her with no effort from her. (For context, she doesn't purposely plan things with me and her friends, which is fine. Additionally, my new friends aren't hounding me about meeting her when i mention her, and all the fun things we did together.) 

I don't know these new friends well enough to mix everyone yet, and I also might never want to mix, because I have social anxiety in groups. Besides this, (here's where I might be wrong) I have a (i know its silly and juvenile) feeling, that one of them might replace me with the other, based on things that happened in high school and college with others. 

But my point feels valid in that I introduced Connie to a new friend at the beginning, and the next time I saw Connie she told me that the two of them went out to brunch without me and have been texting a lot without me. She said she never invited me to brunch because they wanted to talk about video games that i don't play. Now, every once in a while, she'll text me that that friend seems like they're in a bad mood but won't tell her why, so I should check on her or that she invited her somewhere and she said no. Now I'm supposed to play triangulation because that friend is very introverted, but I'm closer to her than she is. 

I don't know what to do because she keeps asking. I don't know how to even say ""I may never introduce you to my friends or I prefer to keep my friends separate"" in a nice way and I don't know if I would be wrong in feeling or acting in this way."

"You are not wrong to keep them separate.
It seems to me though that you could be misinterpreting requests from your old friend.
A lot of people don't like when their friend tells them about having fun with someone else. You are provoking a pretty nasty mix of thoughts and feelings (sadness for being left out, envy, doubt, you name it) and even a very kind friend without any social struggles may find it hard to deal with this mix.
Try not to ""brag"" (even if you don't feel it like bragging) about your time with others, just talk about you two and things you have in common."	DipityDooDot	reply	na	na	na	0.0026109828613698483	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"Yeah I get you...I feel the same about this. If I make a friend I'd want to get to know them well before bringing them into other areas of my life. For instance, if I make a friend I wouldn't want to get them to join a sports club I'm in as If this friendship has issues then I don't even have the other thing which is my own to fall back on. 

I totally understand your mindset on this situation - as you say would want to make it more organic if was doing this anyway...the other friends may not want this anyway! 

 If ever did want to introduce them could perhaps arrange a meeting with a low amount of interaction - for instance watch a movie together or go see a concert or you could arrange to meet one of your friends before meet the other friend and have a quick meeting to test the water. You could have plans to go to some gig with the second friend (so have an excuse to wrap things up) and could make the arrangements work so could make the time all three of you are together is as long as you want. 

One possible option is could tell your friend that you prefer one on one interactions due to anxiety if don't want to be in a group situation. whatever you decide to do, best of luck."	DipityDooDot	reply	na	na	na	0.0026109828613698483	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

Additional thought: stories like ""N is in a bad mood, don't want to talk with me, please check on her"" seem pretty invasive to me (if I imagine that I am the friend in a bad mood).

"Its understandable that you may subconsciously feel there is a chance of being replaced given that your friend befriended one of your friends before and arranged get togethers. I'm not saying that's what would happen or that's the intention but it makes your stance understandable. 

 If you introduce them I personally wouldn't tell her not to ask for someone's contact info - I just don't think that would come across well tbh with you. I think you might benefit by sitting down either by yourself or with a therapist to really understand your underlying feelings before even considering introducing your friends to one another.

"I have social anxiety and I'm unemployed right now.

I've a pharmacy bachelors degree and I'm trying to find a remote job now. I know, it's hard to find a remote job, but nevertheless I'm trying. I've found a recruitment company and wrote them, that I'm only interested in remote jobs.

Well, the answer was: Your chance of getting a remote job are almost 0 %. You should get out of your comfort zone. Companies will prefer other candidates over you. 

&#x200B;

I was pissed. There is a damn reason, why I'm only looking for a remote job. I've even told them beforehand, that I know, that only looking a remote job is a hindrance. But now, I get judged for my wish. 

&#x200B;

I've worked in the hospitality industry for many, many years and it was awful. I don't enjoy human company. My university years were awful, because I really hated lab. I hated working together with others, I was anxious all the time. 

Sometimes my depression is so bad, that I'm struggling to leave the house. 

And my dad has cancer. He's doing better right now, but someone needs to stay with him. 

&#x200B;

So, that's why I'm looking for a remote job. But nope, I get judged and people tell me: Leave your comfort zone, it will get better.  It never gets better. 

&#x200B;

For the last 15 years I'm leaving my comfort zone all the time and it's still not getting better. I'm still anxious, I'm still afraid of talking in front of  big crows I'm still freaking out if I have to call, I'm still overthinking everything way too often. 

I was in therapy many years ago and I was still afraid after therapy.

"I Interviewed for a position within the medical field using a MMIs format, i.e. multiple mini interviews. Basically there were 10 stations with 2 individuals at each station and interviewees rotate through the stations. I was extremely nervous the entire time but still felt I did well in terms of my responses. 

A few weeks later I received an email informing me that I was not selected as one of the candidates to move forward but that I could receive feedback if I was interested. They gave me the option to set up a phone call with several of the interviewers on a conference call where they went over each station and provided both positive and negative feedback based on the notes. I was given a lot of positive feedback and they seemed impressed by my performance and answers. But for more than half of the stations, I received negative feedback that I seemed nervous and/or did not make enough eye contact. In fact, my nervousness and/or lack of eye contact was the only negative thing they had to say about my interview. 

I feel like my inability to make eye contact stems solely from my social anxiety. Being excluded from the pool of candidates based on a symptom of a mental disorder feels unjust. I have a disability beyond my control and I’m being excluded for showing symptoms of that disability.

"Sorry it didn't work out for you. I think though something good has come from this even though it may seem negative.

If you ask most job interviewers for feedback I feel a lot would sugar coat the feedback and not tell the brutal honest truth. You got that feedback from more than half the stations - you now have something which you can consciously work on. This is valuable information.

Yeah, you could definitely make a case for this being unjust. I also struggle with eye contact a great deal so I can empathize with this struggle. I probably get this wrong more than I even realise if i'm to be totally honest.

You state that ""I have a disability beyond my control"". I sometimes feel like this too and just want people to accept me the way I am. However, I think this is a cold, ruthless and unforgiving world we live in - it would be better to try make self-improvements than to hope others in this world will be compassionate and accommodating cause I feel doing so will bring a lot of disappointment.

If you are able to honestly say something like ""I'm struggling with my mental health but I'm doing everything I can to tackle this head on by trying support groups, counselling, exposure therapy,  getting mental health assessments etc."" you would be on the right track to rectifying it.

I obviously don't know what you've done to tackle treating your SA (if you are being very proactive then you can't ask any more of yourself then that). I just want to share about myself - I haven't been proactive enough in sorting my SA. I'm hoping to get another psychological evaluation in near future as I feel my mental health has got worse over recent times (and may possibly be more than SA that I have). Have had SA for years and it's now getting to the point where I have times where I feel excruciating mental pain. I feel avoided/excluded/judged at work and feel hopelessness/emptiness at times. I realise now that I have a mental health problem which I need to take seriously which I am responsible to take appropriate action to try get this under control.

The job was unpaid, volunteer work to support researchers within a hospital. Basically you would have work with a group of people to assist the different studies being conducted. My understanding was that the role would require face-to-face contact with patients to determine whether or not they qualified to join the study and to have them sign consent forms.

I’m very much an introvert and for me, making eye contact feels threatening — it activates my fight or flight response and I begin to feel physical symptoms to the point where I’ve almost passed out in a professors office once. I’m a female and I have to wear thick foundation, not because I like it, no, in fact I hate the feeling of anything on my face. I have to wear it because I get so flushed in the face speaking to strangers for work/school — and my face turns extremely bright red. It’s humiliating. Social anxiety is the worst.

"Based on that info, I would think that eye contact is very important for that role. It is a very crucial part of building rapport with people you are working with on such a study, as well as establishing trust with they participants of the study. The length of commitment required for that project tells me that candidates need to be comfortable on day one, and throughout the entire project for it to go well. 

If the job requires a lot of face-to-face time (or more than you can handle), it is not a good fit for you or them. Would you somewhat agree with that?

"so I started university in march this year and it was and still is really difficult adjusting to the new environment and people in general. I didn't speak to anyone at all for the first two terms of being there although my class is really small (about 14 people). this kind of makes things worse because everyone is really close with each other and I felt like I stuck out like a sore thumb being there. not the mention I'm studying film so the entire school is just basically filled with loud bubbly extroverts. which brings me to my main point. 

one of my professor's literally hates me. at first I thought maybe I was just over thinking but even the few friends I've managed to make have told me that she seems to intentionally pick on me for no reason. she's constantly stopping me in the hallway to have meaningless conversation or just make me uncomfortable I feel. like one time I was literally running to the bathroom mid panic attack and she happened to be in the hallway and stopped me and screamed at me for not greeting her. I just continued running to the bathroom and subsequently lost my shit. 

the other week I had three presentations over the course of two days and was obviously really anxious about it as you can imagine. (we had to present Infront of the entire year group and professors). each presentation was on a different discipline in film depending on what you choose to do a practical on. (I wasn't aware we'd have to to a presentation on each discipline until after I'd already chose three of them lol). i.e. (editing, directing, producing, and CWL). 

editing and CWL went well for the most part. both professor's gave good feedback and my editing profesor even said he was proud of me which I was very surprised about as I thought he didn't like me lol. anyway, my directing professor is the one who hates me and for the sake of this story we'll call her D. so right before my presentation my group and I were practicing everything in a classroom and we were on my section when she walks in the room so I stopped speaking. (thinking she came to tell us something or just wanted to say something). biggest mistake ever lol. she starts screaming super loudly Infront of everyone ""NO NO NO NO NO. ""NAME"" YOU CAN'T GO SILENT EVERY TIME I ENTER THE ROOM. YOU NEED TO MAKE EYE CONTACT."" and continues to scream at me to make eye contact with her. which is something I've always found really difficult to do. she does this constantly. in fact every single time we interact she screams at me for not making eye contact with her. she's obviously making it worse for me by doing this but clearly she doesn't see that. or maybe she does and she just wants to ruin my life idk idk. 

anyway. right after she was done screaming at me we had to go do our presentation which was Infront of the second year group on this day due to one of our group members not being able to make it the day before. (thus, we were the only first years in the room and had to be the first to present as well). so the order of the presentation is producer, director, DoP (director of photography), and editor. our producer introduces our group so gracefully and I just look at her thinking how I wish I could have the presentations skills she has. she then hands over to me and I begin my presentation (which is timed for three minutes). I thought I did okay content wise but I definitely struggled making eye contact and looked at the ground most of the time. I was also shaking a lot and so was my voice. (although I felt I would have felt at least a little less nervous had she not screamed at me right before my presentation). 

anyway. after our groups finish our presentation the lecturers have to leave the room to discuss it and then come back to give us all individual feedback. once they come back our HOD speaks first and says that she is so proud of all of us and that this was probably the best presentation amongst our year group thus far and even says that the second years in the room should take notes. after hearing this I felt really nice and even felt a sense of ease thinking that my feedback from D would be good since our HOD had such good things to say about it. so they continue down the line of lecturers's and each one of them gives feedback to their respective student and D is last to speak. even tho I was nervous to present I was excited to hear her feedback as I've always wanted to pursue directing since I was young so this presentation (amongst the three) was probably the most important to me personally. so I brace myself for her feedback and she says ""uhm... well it was okay but you could've made more eye contact"" I honestly think the whole room could have felt my spirit drop to the floor in that moment. I felt so shattered honestly I literally just wanted to run out of the room and cry. but I continued to listen to her speak. which honestly she didn't have much else to say. but I worked so hard on that presentation that I at least thought she'd give me some kind words. I guess I was wrong. 

she went on to say that she just spoke to me about my lack of eye contact that I should've done better and been more engaged with the audience. but I don't see how I could've fixed the issue in the five minutes between her screaming at me and then immediately walking to the other room to present. 

I think the HOD saw how saddened this made made me and quickly interjected and said ""but really first years you all did so well and I'm so proud of this group as a whole"". and all the other lecturers besdies D nodded their heads in agreement. this did little to comfort me tbh and after that I went to the bathroom and had a panic attack which sucked. but what can you do. I feel like I'm trying really hard to adjust to all the new things happening in my life recently and honestly uni is a huge adjustment from high school especially since I did online high school so it was even harder for me to get used to all these big changes. I even thought I was doing okay since arriving like I even made some friends which I never thought I'd be able to do. (I struggle with selective mutism so this was really hard for me). but luckily there were some really nice and understanding people in my class. but I literally just feel like every single time I feel proud of myself for certain progresses I've made D just shuts me down completely and makes me feel shit about my s or again. like I don't deserve to be there. like I'm not cut out for any of it. 

sometimes I feel like I should've taken a year off after high school or something. like maybe I jumped into things too quickly. or maybe just that I'm not cut out for this industry as a whole. but one of my friends who I spoke to about everything said that they see it from D's perspective and that maybe she sees potential in me or maybe she's just trying to motivate me in a harsh kind of way. (I guess like Gordon Ramsey lol). which I don't understand at all. and I don't think that screaming in someone's face for them to make eye contact with you is the way to go about things. and this is literally proven by one of my other lecturers who is so nice to me and calm and patient even in moments where I struggle to get any words out at all and just look at the ground and stutter he'll say ""it's okay take your time"" or ""how can I help you today bestie"" lmao. this has literally made me want to try harder to speak to him since he's so accommodating towards my issues but I guess she'll never understand this. she just screams in my face and humiliates me Infront of everyone every single time. 

and since I first started there in march she was one of the first people to approach me while I was sitting alone and I even thought she was nice. (boy was I mistaken lmao). she even said to me ""you're a bit shy aren't you?"" to which I nodded and she smiled as if she understood but now it's clear she doesn't understand anything. it's like she can't comprehend anyone who isn't extremely loud and extroverted at all times. which I must admit is most of the people at that institution.

nevertheless. I guess I just want to know if this is all my fault and maybe I'm just being dumb or a bad student or something. I've literally thought about dropping out which I really don't want to do because I literally love it and am so passionate about it and this is all I've ever wanted to do. but I feel like if I'm struggling so much now and can't even handle one mean professor or make eye contact with her how will I ever make it in the industry.

"Dude, it's not your fault and you are not dumb, don't blame yourself. It sounds like D just wants to mess with you. Even if she has good intentions (which I highly doubt), her actions are still awful and uncalled for. D is verbally abusing you.

I say you try to report or ignore her. You can't let people like her bring you down. Try to pay attention to those that care about you and are kind to you instead of her.

Also, sidenote:  if you struggle to make eye contact, try to look at the top of people's head. Pretend your making eye contact."	fafxD	reply	na	na	na	0.999226450920105	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety

It's a small success story where I basically just walked into two gyms near my house and inquired about the gym membership fees and looked at their equipment. My heart was racing, and I had mixed feelings, but I just took a deep breath up and did it anyway. Joining a gym has been on my mind, but I couldn't muster the courage to do so. I might join the gym membership next time if I ahve a chance.	Punch_bob888	post	17.491600412911406	male	White	0.002978360978886485	na	na	na	6	socialanxiety
Way to go! I heartily recommend joining a gym. It is a really good form of exposure therapy. The gym is a place where you can be around people but it's acceptable to not talk to anyone. It's also great because you have something to do instead of standing around awkwardly. Gym folk may at first look intimidating but I find are actually highly encouraging, positive, and excited to see progression of any kind. Lastly, you'd be amazed at how many gym folks are there because they have social anxiety, and have gravitated to working out as a way to tangibly change their self view.

"Way to go!!!! I can relate to this entirely and feel the need to share a bit about my similar story here. I was on the same boat an year back. It was 7°C and I went to the gym to talk about the membership and all. The anxiety was so bad I was literally sweating as if I was coming out of the gym. I lied to the gym folks that I ran all the way to the gym from my house hence I am sweating. 

I am a guy 24 y.o. I went to the gym the next day and the anxiety was even more terrible. I couldn't do chest press with even 2.5kg weight. Couldn't do biceps curl with even 2.5 kg and seeing every other guy/girl doing biceps curl with 7.5kg literally made me so anxious that I wanted to quit. 

I quit for a week but joined back again.

The best thing I did was I did not quit all together. I faced social anxiety for 4 days a week for 1 year. Now I can do 12.5kg biceps curl, 15kg chest press all within 8 months of starting with 2kg weights. 

Fun fact is I still have social anxiety but it has reduced. I even help out other people now in the gym who are getting started and to correct their forms.

Now I would not say that going to the gym just stopped my social anxiety completely but as I am building a good physique I have seen that it actually reduces anxiety a lot.

I would say just jump on it. Just run and go to the gym. You would already be sweating which you can use to cover to physical symptoms if any. Dont wait. Just join it! You gathered the courage to go to the gym, you did the hard part. Now just buy a headphone and jump on to doing things.

And if I can do it. You can do it too. I had a very low self esteem due to my skinny body and being bullied by guys and girls both during my school days. Going to the gym and looking in the mirror now and checking all those losers of my school on Instagram literally makes me feel like a winner now."

"[21 M]
Wearing a short T-shirt that's not covering my butt makes me extremely anxious as I feel everyone is looking at it, even though it's not true, and wearing long ones make me uncomfortable. When I was in preparatory, A middle aged man slapped me from behind, in front of guests at my house and they viewed it as a joke, I felt embarrassed, furious, and violated. All in all, he stayed at our home for another couple of days.
It wasn't only him, my stupid friends (boys) had a stupid game to stick their fingers in someone's butt or stand behind a boy and act as if they were sexually engaging him.
Even before entering school, there was a doctor that stripped my pants and stuck his finger deeply inside of me for a rectal check-up, I constantly feel violated and humiliated remembering this, he stuck it in me in front of my father, my younger brother, and his colleagues.
I forgot to mention that a colleague of mine during secondary school managed to forcefully hold me in an 11 position at his room, I felt his p**is. We were in weekend so there weren't many people at the dorms, I still couldn't tell whether it was a joke or he was really going to r*pe me if it wasn't for that single guy we heard walking by the corridor.
My mother and my brother, whom I haven't told anything about it, are pressuring me into letting go of my covering shirts and start wearing T-shirts as they think it looks more fashionable and trendy.

Oh my god what? That definitely sounds like an abuse I'm sorry that U have to go through that. Please seek help from someone. Try to share it with your closed one they will definitely understand how you feel or talk to a therapist. No matter what anyone says, wear a tshirt only if u feel comfortable in it otherwise just don't u don't have to fit in society norms if it bothers you. Oversized outfits are cool and comfortable anyway. Also u mentioned u don't like the long ones as well, then try finding which suits you the best and also helps with your insecurities. Once you overcome your trauma and feel confident, you can easily style yourself however you want without feeling humiliated. Try surrounding yourself with good people and cut off all the toxic relationship that you have right now. Everything is easier said than done I know but trust me you got this.

"I’m sorry you’ve been through that with so many people violating your personal boundaries and even assaulting you. I do think that a therapist may be helpful in helping you to process what has happened but also to help you in formulating how you will deal with such situations if they ever happen again. I think that if you feel like you can protect your personal boundaries more confidently, you’ll feel less insecure in general. I’m not a therapist so I’m sure they will have better ideas. 

In the meantime, don’t feel pressured to change how you dress.

First stat by looking in youtube what theraphy suposse to be like. I advise you use incognito mode as if you algoritym pick it up youll be targeted by very predatory stuff that wont help and its only proupose its to drain your money.

I'm getting it together now, but it's harder than ever. My anxiety isn't completely consuming me like it once was but it's still constantly there. it's just manifests differently now. 

things will get better and we will grow stronger. do you know what makes you so anxious about the jobs you work?"	tuh_timmyandtheboys	reply	na	na	na	0.012291185557842255	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
Advertising creative here - it’s hard to think of a worse industry to get into for someone with anxiety issues; constant late nights, weekend work, endless intense deadlines and intimidating internal creative reviews and client presentations. I’ve managed to keep my head above water for 15 years now but have been laid off or made redundant four times. It’s absolute hell at times and I’ve burnt out / had nervous breakdowns three times now. It’s getting so bad I honestly don’t know how I’m going to keep going as I’m desperately fatigued and unhappy.	tuh_timmyandtheboys	reply	na	na	na	0.012291185557842255	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"First, sorry for my english my first language is french hehe and for the long text to.

I totally relate to your story. I've been struggling with social anxiety as long as i can remember and i think the first step and the most difficult is to accept it. Im 28m, currently unemployed after 1 years of pure hell. Constant Social interaction at my last job causing constant stress that lead to depression,OCD,performance anxiety. Since i was 17 yo i had like 10 different job.. never felt like i was at the right place. Always felt lost.. last years, ive applied to a job i knew was gonna be hard for me cause theres a lot of teamwork and you need to be part a group.. something ive never been able to acheive. Not that i didnt want i am just not made for that. The job was a very well paid, stable hours, 4 days a week, always near home. That was the dream job for me.. i thought but it left me mentally and physicaly completly destroyed near suicidal tendencies.. like i said above i knew it was gonna be hard but i was willing to gave it a try and never let that social anxiety drive my life again.. i was really hoping this time it were gonna be the right job for me.. since the start of my new job i was really stressed and i tought it would pass with time but i was only going down and worst. I was unable to concentrate on my job so i was always making mistake and those mistake ruined a little by little the tiny amount of self esteem ive had.. coworkers was piss off because they didnt understand what i was going thru they just tought i wasnt good enuff for the job.. they begin to hate me to because i wasnt able to small talk, making friend.. i was distant. Ive had to swallow my pride and quit before they lead me off. At the time i was thinkin it was the end of the world but ots been 3 month since i quit now and i think its one the best decision ive made in my life. I wasnt made for that kind of job, im never gonna be the guy that talk to everybody with ease and i accept it. Social anxiety disorder will always be part of me till my death.. its part of my personnality and its alright. People with that kind of disorder are usually very kind,empatic person. My friends and family loves me for who i am. Others that dont understand or just dont want to can frig off i dont need them in my life. You dont have to put yourself into the fire just to fit what the society told you to. Embrace who your are. Quit try to be like everybody its so lame and you will just end up broken. Try to listen to your heart more often it will guide you to the right place for you. Medication and a counselor help me a lot and to be kind with yourself. Dont know if it make sense but its do for me. Still strugglin but less since im tryin tp use it at my advantage and quit tryin to change who i am.

"Since graduating high school in 2013 I've only had 3 real jobs, 2 of which were fulltime. I had a few summer jobs that lasted July to August but I don't like to count them since I didn't do much at those ""jobs"" and didn't need to apply or interview for them. I am beyond poor. I have no hope for the future. My parents are the only thing keeping me alive. I don't know how I'm even going to make it on my own once they're gone, I hope it's not soon.

Those 2 fulltime jobs were last year. This year I've applied to a few places. Most have not replied back but the ones that do... I can't make myself go to them. It's been so long since I've worked, I've gotten way too used to not having to wake up on time, stay up as long as I want, having all my free time be mine. I've gotten some responses asking me to come in for an interview but when the day comes I just don't feel like going, and my brain feels so empty as well, I wouldn't even know what to say on an interview anymore, like why they can't just give me the job? Lol. The longer I go without a job, the harder it is to get back into work habits, also cognitive decline from not having anyone to speak with, not doing anything mentally stimulating is making it even harder to find work. And I'm so tired of filling out applications for jobs I already know I'm not going to interview for because I'm too lazy.

Ok this might sound like shit advice but this is coming from my personal experience as someone who has had crippling social anxiety. Exposure therapy. It sounds terrifying I know, but once you put yourself out there it helps so much. The anxiety will never fully go away, but you will adapt and learn. Also talk to your dr about medication if you are open to it and seek therapy if you do not already have a therapist (which is a pain in the ass too I know).

I've been unemployed for over a year now. I'm out of money now and need to find work again. I have a biochem background and my work requires a fair amount of social interaction as it's a highly regulated industry and everything you do needs verification from another associate. Typically jobs are structured as teams who you spend most of the day with. Despite enjoying the work and making good money, I don't think I'm going to go back to it.

8th grade and freshman year of high school I pretty much refused to go to school. That's when it started.

I did 15 years of tech support where I was miserable every day. I quit 5 years ago and started doing gig apps. Huge improvement in my happiness as I didn't have to set an alarm and could work when I felt like it.

"exactly the same here but i’m 20f. literally only work twice a week in some warehouse for a few hours, my family are so ashamed and embarrassed. this is my 6th job since leaving high school at 17. all of my previous jobs have been retail, and in the end they fire me due to being unable to socialise with the team properly, messing things up (due to the fear anxiety of actually being there). i remember my previous job was at a small cafe, to then be in the back loading the dishwasher all day while crying as i just couldn’t cope with the amount of people walking through. 

im currently waiting for an autism assessment though so maybe that’s why. it’s so much harder leaving high school as there’s no routine anymore no structure it’s all gone. everyday is different and i hate it. i also think of suicide everyday, i cant see my life ever improving. i have no support system, like i said my family are ashamed and always call me a “lay about” and try to encourage me to get another job (back in customer service again). i really don’t know what to do anymore. i have no family and every job is the same cycle"	tuh_timmyandtheboys	reply	na	na	na	0.012291185557842255	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"I grew fed up and started to try to change my life . Got a seasonal job at JCPenney portraits. Luckily the studio manager who interviewed me decided to hire me . I told her about my anxiety. October to December. The February after that I got a job at a local museum that my sister was working at (thanks to an uncles brother who worked the night shift there). Not even two weekends later Covid happened. So I was off more time than when I worked there basically. Still got paid. March to mid august then another bout in the winter . Then the following winter was a week or two off . But I’ve made friends there and it was nice but standing all day as a museum guard was hard on my lower half and back. I had to get a scan on my knee which showed extended tendinosis. I left voluntarily in July 2022. Got the mri scan in November . So to still have tendinosis that long after leaving was serious. I did use my sick days for things like sore legs and at least one for anxiety that they knew about. But I was away with my sister for a trip to see a kpop band of hers and took off on the day I came back in the morning . Was honest  that I couldn’t make it back in time and that’s the reason for missing (after they rejected my holiday request to have it off ) so they wrote me up , cried in front of them so that was a horrible experience. I don’t like crying in front of ppl. That was right before I left and didn’t explain my reason for leaving so they assumed I quit because of that probably. But they also knew I was going to physical therapy for my knee. Which I later emailed them about that for some other reason after leaving. I also emailed them back about returning part time which they offered before I left to be easier on me but I wanted the  break and cash in vacation days since the new fiscal year started in July.  But when emails about wanting to return part time they “respectfully declined” (this was before I told them it was only because of my knee ). Assholes . 
So anyway earlier this year from beginning of march to tax day I worked as the receptionist (they called it officially by the title of client service personnel) at H&R Block. That was small but nice. Easier on my knees since I got to sit . Doable with my anxiety since I could handle customers a bit more . Used the phone because there was usually a script I could use for most of it.

"She likes playing the sims, learning languages, and she's working on writing a novel. The novel brings a lot of anxiety relating to worrying how people will take it, but it is also an opportunity to center characters who have the experiences that she has had, including extreme social anxiety. I love reading it. It takes a lot of time for her to craft each chapter, but it's something she values. If you have anything you value but worry you wouldn't be able to do it, I'd consider figuring out how to fold it or something like it into your life in a way that doesn't harm you or wear you down. Tiredness comes with many hobbies, but as long as it is restoring you in some way and the wear doesn't overshadow it, I think it's worth trying to figure out.

"I did both. Therapy is more retroactive and the purpose is an intense way to connect with the emotions of your past and process them. Once they are processed, quality of life should be more peaceful.

Life coaching, in my experience, was about- what were your goals? And what is preventing you from getting there? Most of these barriers are emotional too. But life coach takes into account also the small steps that it takes to get to that purpose. It’s like an occupational therapist that rehabs you for specific actions, versus a physical therapist that works intensely on rehab."	tuh_timmyandtheboys	reply	na	na	na	0.012291185557842255	no	strong	strong	na	socialanxiety
I have PTSD and ADHD so they can really be triggered by a lot of things. The night I was fired during a panic attack I was working at a cafe with a live band. I was super new at this point and wasn’t trained very consistently and my boss was giving me a ton of new tasks to do one after the other and with the loud music and everything I just kept getting more overwhelmed. It got to the point where I completely forgot where I was, I couldn’t remember things I had done minutes ago, I couldn’t get my words out fast enough, and in that moment I just felt terrified. That doesn’t fully describe my experience but it’s the best I can do for now. Anyway I couldn’t stop myself from crying at this point and had to step outside for a moment to collect myself and that’s when my boss came out to talk to me and she pretty much decided to fire me on the spot.	tuh_timmyandtheboys	reply	na	na	na	0.012291185557842255	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"You’re totally set with a notebook and a pencil- people will have them I promise. You’re going to see so many different people there which I know made me feel more comfortable. I bring a planner too but your professors will give you a paper copy of the syllabus to write on/ circle important dates. 
You’ll notice instantly, just like most social situations, everyone is too focused on themselves to notice anyone else. 

You’ll see people on their phones and maybe 1 or 2 talking but for the most part the first week- attention will be only on the professor. Worst part is getting through a few ice breakers (only occasionally if class sizes are smaller) but they’ll be dreaded by everyone and it’s usually your name and 1 answer to a fairly simple prompt - even if you just make something up or give a generic answer.

The first day is always the easiest (in terms of difficulty with regard to the material) because the professor will just be going over the syllabus the entire class and discuss expectations for the class, plagiarism, code of conduct, etc. — go early and find a seat in the very back, it will be more difficult to see if it’s a large lecture hall (bring your glasses if you wear them) but the back is ideal for socially anxious people because you won’t feel like everyone is looking at you and you can get up and leave first right when class is over. Bring your backpack to hold your supplies. Notebook, writing utensils. Do you have a laptop? iPad with keyboard? Bring those things if you want to type out notes. Make sure when you log in you don’t have a movie playing loud or something because that would be embarrassing for you. Go really early and get your seat. Show up 30 minutes early if you have to because being late will add to your embarrassment so avoid that. Thats great that you’re practicing where the class is ahead of time with your dad. Plan for parking spots if you’re commuting too, often its hard to find a spot. I hate icebreakers, but if its a large lecture hall with a lot of students the professor often won’t do them because of how much time it would waste. If you do have to do them just know that there are other people there who are just as scared to talk as you and you’ll only have to do it once all semester. If you can, try to make friends with the people around you. Start by just saying hi the first day and introduce yourself. Your peers can be a big resource in college. Consider if you have to miss a day, you can ask them for their notes. After tests/quizzes, you can talk amongst yourself about the problems you missed, etc. You can have someone to work on homework together or study. When you get the syllabus, see if there are any rules against recording the lecture. If there aren’t then I would highly suggest you record it (an audio recording) because if you’re socially anxious it may be hard to really concentrate on what is being said at times. Good luck.

I've seen some posts about the same problem. Basically, my head shakes left-right in some situations, for example: eye contact (feels like a bullet is shot into my head, and something comes from the bottom of my neck to the head, and it shakes), when I'm eating/drinking and somebody watching. Also it may occur when I'm very anxious on my own, or when I'm doing some exercises in gym (not from anxiety there, in gym I actually feel pretty good, and head shakes a little different than from other situations I described). Also when somebody takes a photo of me (and even if I take it myself sometimes for some reason). If I'm talking, the chance of shake is less. The things that helped so far - no sleeping for a long time (50-80℅ reduction), alcohol (99%), propranolol (20-70%, not sure if it actually helps), being exhausted from exercises (90-99%). Also it may randomly be higher it lower on different days. I'm trying to convince myself that it's not even that bad (and honestly it doesn't look that bad), and trying to force it, but my subconsciousness just won't allow me. It's like trying to take a giant hornet in my hands, when I'm scared to death even looking at pictures of them. And I'm most sure if it's completely physiological or have some physical roots (from my bad posture perhaps? I've seen someone here talking about same thing and mentioning his bad posture). Probably a mix of both tbh. It's been 5 years when it started, and even though I can exist with this problem, it's hard to actually live with it. I probably won't find an answer here, but it would've been great to find someone who overcame this problem. Therapist is obvious solution, but I can't afford something, that is 1/5 of a salary, and one visit won't be nearly enough...

Is this something that other people notice, or is it more something that you feel? I guess the first step would be talking to a doctor or a PT to rule out  any physiological issues.

I can't take pictures, go to the barber shop, defend myself in conflict situations and much more.

I talked to a psychiatrist about it. The medications he prescribed didn't help. Maybe I need to see a neurologist. I read that it is not always treatable. But in any case, at the moment I am too weak emotionally / mentally to decide to go to the doctor.

I really hope that you will be able to ""accept"" your tremor.
As for me, it's impossible, it's not something that can be fixed simply by changing the perspective or by some kind of reflection.

I never go inside anywhere except once a month I go to a goth nightclub (more my vibe) but I never meet anyone. All I do outside of work is lift weights and be moody alone and outside of work I have no interaction with anyone.

"I've had severe social anxiety my entire life.  Have worked with multiple therapists doing CBT with exposure therapy. It's discouraging because every exposure that I feel doesn't go well just kinda adds to feelings of hopelessness. Never has my social anxiety felt like something that could be treated by leaning into it, and in fact feels like forcing it, even in a controlled manner, only gives me confirmation that it's never going to get any easier. I've been reading about how a lot of newer research suggests that therapies which try to fit a neuro divergent person into ""normal"" society can be extremely damaging to the patient and create something of a trauma response as well as increase risk of reverting to unhealthy coping like substance use. I know social anxiety isn't considered neuro divergent, but at least for me I feel like this applies."	morriry	post	12.31006395579538	female	White	0.9981088638305664	na	na	na	5	socialanxiety

cbt and exposure therapy are working well for me, but i don't know how neurodivergent i am. personally, based on the way you're describing cbt, i think u had the wrong mindset about exposures. when u do an exposure, ur supposed to watch out for post-exposure negative thinking, and set very small goals."	morriry	reply	na	na	na	0.9981088638305664	no	strong	strong	na	socialanxiety

I initially was exposed to the idea of CBT being ineffective for neuro divergence from a psychology podcast I listened to. It resonated strongly with me so that's when I started looking at articles. The idea is that while anxiety is a mental health disorder which can be treated as such, neuro divergence is not. So it makes sense that trying to train someone to behave in a way that their brain simply won't allow would cause further distress and overtime serious damage. It would be the equivalent of taking a homosexual person and trying to make them straight. Which unfortunately has, and still is done a lot and causes all kinds of issues for those people, often resulting in self-harm, or suicide.	morriry	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9981088638305664	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
I’m moving out and so I’ve been selling most of my things on Facebook marketplace. Every single person who shows up to my place says “I’m here” before coming to the door.. and idk why but everytime I see that message I start having a major anxiety attack, and I never know what to do. Sometimes I open my front door and sometimes I just pretend like I didn’t see the message and wait for them to knock.. either way I feel so stupid after I finish selling something to them no matter how I react to the message 😂	leafygreensxx	post	25.8630118689746	female	White	0.9987818598747253	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety

fair enough, I try and leave as much stuff outside as I can too. the main reason I’d prefer them to just knock and not send the message is so I can basically forget they are even coming and not sit here having anxiety about them being outside.

I'm 22 years old. This has happened always.  Everytime in school when you have to introduce yourself to the class (even just own name), do a group project, presentation or getting asked a question randomly makes me super anxious. My face feels hot, and I think everyone is judging. Worse if I see anyone staring. Almost every time after the speaking part is done I feel like I said it weird and everyone remembers it, when propably they forget right after or don't even care what I said. Rest of the day I would like to just run away from school in in the middle of the day. I just hope I can manage someday in a workplace.

My friend knows how I feel at his parties but doesn’t seem to care enough to help with it. I’m worried that if I stop going to his parties, he’ll stop wanting to be my friend and I’ll become more depressed, actively suicidal again and that my social anxiety will get worse again because I’m not doing social things.

"I'm very confused right now.

I don't understand what's going on with my emotions lately.
I've been socially anxious for nearly a decade, and yet it now slowly seems like its mostly dissipated all on its own within this last week.

To preface, this week I've been much more outgoing and open with others. I wont say I've been very friendly, but I've been communicative and less nervous to talk to others.
Usually I would avoid social interactions like a plague, and yet now I still would rather avoid them but don't mind them and they're less awkward for me when there's a silence or just in general.

Near the beginning of this week, I walked into a gas station and asked for an application.
I was sort of nervous to do it cause it was a new situation and I was still a bit awkward about it, but I wasn't so scared as id usually be.
I went to do it myself and ask for it, something I would never have the courage to usually do.

When I went in, the man at the counter told me to come back tomorrow morning. I didn't show that day cause I was too late and too scared to walk there on my own (my social anxiety has been in a weird flux this week, its like on and off but mostly off/subtle).

I went back the day after that and asked about the job offer I mentioned to the other worker. I didn't know he wasn't the manager, and the individual at the counter I was currently talking to was the manager. She told me to submit an app that day and I did it on the spot. She said she'd call me tomorrow morning, they didn't call. But she called me 2 or 3 days later, saying the app didn't come through yet but to come in for an interview Monday.

Well, I got the job! It'll be my first ever official job so I'm pretty nervous about that.
But the thing is, the thing that's confusing me is I've been able to ease my anxiety, put it to the side this last week like as if it were a forethought.
I was not an ounce anxious during the interview which lasted about 15 minutes and I spoke clearly, usually I would just talk lower or a bit too unclear, like I wasnt confident in what I was saying or myself. I did none of that.

I spoke loudly and answered clearly, and I maintained direct eye contact throughout most of the interview, something I try to avoid doing.

Luckily for me the manager didn't ask too many detailed questions and was a fairly nice lady, but that still should have went so worse for me in my eyes.

I'm confused on where this sudden courage is coming from. I've been scared to do this very thing my entire life and yet I've done it all within a week, which is absurd.

I was planning on buying supplements to ease my anxiety, magnesium glycinate and vitamin d3, but I honestly dont even think I really need them that much anymore. The only thing I feel now is not anxiety, but nervousness for the unknown. But I've been able to sideline that feeling consistently, telling myself to do it anyways.

I don't mean to humble brag, I'm just confused on what's going on inside of me.

Aside from that, I've been much more confident talking to a lady I recently met online. I asked her what she would like to do for a date and I plan on scheduling one for her, but I've noticed an overall improvement in my communication and anxiety around talking to women. It's went down quite a lot and I've become BOLDLY flirtatious which is, quite weird for me. I tend to try to walk the respectful route and I still do, but before I would avoid making most compliments, now I'm more riskier with it. That lady I mentioned before is the only one that still makes me feel a bit nervous because we've been talking on the phone to each other and I've gotten to know her. It makes me anxious if I come off as weird to her because id hope not to,she's a wonderful woman who's very intelligent and kind, things i admire deeply from her, and in general. And, she's also out of my league! I can't comprehend what's going on. My luck with ladies and life in general has went up tremendously during the past week and im much more confident to be myself, to take up some space. 

Am I lucky? Or am I just ""outgrowing"" my anxiety, something I didn't really consider possible? My sister said she outgrew hers mostly when she got older, but I never really believed her. And I doubt that's what's happened because I haven't pushed myself to go into social situations or events, I've been doing the same thing I always have.

I intend on using this boost of courage to try to achieve all the things I've been putting off on, and I've already knocked down one! There's just a few more things to get done. I also made a phone call to a school to change the status of my application and apply to a different area of study and it went well.

Anyways, sorry about the long drawn out post.
I just wanted to share my very unusual experience with the only people who understand what I (usually) feel."	User112011	post	16.538589881382435	male	White	0.005715393461287022	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety

Not saying this to doubt myself though. I just recognize she's very much well off, but aside from that she's great as an individual. Very good. She's what I strive to be in myself cause she's a very free spirited person.

"As a 16 year old in high school, I do relatively well grades-wise. However, when it comes to socializing, I'm a failure. I don't really talk unless I'm talked to, which is close to never. I get that it's kind of on me that I don't have many friends, but that's aside from the point. Besides, I'm sure my RBF is probably to blame as well.

Due to me being quiet, it seems that everybody around me makes up terrible and untrue things about me. Some that I hear a lot are ""school shooter"", ""kidnapper"", and (my personal favorite) ""The Riddler from The Batman"". I have never really understood why. Isn't being called a school shooter what can cause one? It's not like I would even want to hurt anybody around me.

This has completely demotivated me from making friends at all. I fear that I'll be seen as a creep even if I try to socialize. It's not even that I look bad or something, I just have a bad rep for no reason. If I'm called to talk in class, I always hear the reaction of ""he can talk??????"". It's as if I'm not even seen as another person by them.

When it comes to the rare few I have talked to, they don't even know my name. They refer to me as ""Tyrone"", ""Lebron"", or some other random name. Sometimes I'm just reduced to ""white boy"". I get that it's all light hearted, but it's pretty damn demeaning. I'd like to speak up about it, but I fear I'll just be shut down instantly with how kids my age are.

There are a few kind people who have taken the time to actually understand who I am. The majority of them are women. However, any time I am speaking with them, somebody always has to say something like ""W Rizz"" (even though I'm talking to them completely platonically) and it just makes things awkward. It seems like I'm seen as a joke everywhere around school. I wish people around me would understand that I'm a human being with feelings.

At some point last year, we were to do group projects in an English class. The teacher assigned groups based off who was friends with each other, and, seeing as I had no friends in the class, I got paired up with people who had special needs. This wouldn't have been a problem if it weren't for the fact that not only was the entire workload up to me for the quarter, but I was beginning to be seen as special needs myself. I haven't even been diagnosed for any neurodivergence. This only made people make fun of me even more.

As much as I want to get through high school, the people around me make it a living hell. What should I do? I would love to ignore them, but it's pretty hard when it's everywhere I go. I just want to be seen as an actual human being."	barpentercrut	post	16.02183725814392	male	White	0.9989990592002869	na	na	na	35	socialanxiety
"It is tough. 

“Just ignore them” is very hard to do, especially at an age at which you are still trying to find out who you are and want to feel like you belong. So I won’t say that. 

And you might not even be able ignore them for those 8 hours of school. 

But hopefully you can enjoy yourself when you get home.  That can get you through these years.  I loved going home and engaging in my hobbies throughout high school (and still do). I Fuckin loved weekends - nonstop PlayStation/movies/sports and I could sleep in until 1 pm.  

And, once you get past these years, I believe you’ll have developed a very thick skin, mature attitude, and ways to deal with tough situations…these qualities can help you go very far in life.

"You sound like a very kind individual. I’m sorry things have been so hard and lonely. 

Please know that these years will end! Focus on stuff that fills your life and makes you happy. You’ll have a lot easier time being confident if you love yourself and love your life. Having hobbies your passionate about makes it easier to connect w others too!

Know that kids like that (bullies) are EXTREMELY insecure deep down and need to project that pain outward to make themselves feel better. Which is pretty sad/pathetic if you think about it. Someone like that doesn’t deserve your brain space. 

You might get advice telling you to be hyper macho or aggressive—I dissuade this. Ppl like that are just as miserable as the bullies and trying to compensate. Stand up for yourself and people if you need to but don’t let anger eat at your soul. 

Maybe there’s some other socially anxious kids around you—you should reach out. If there’s any time to practice confidence, it’s high school!! 2 years and you’ll probably never have to see these ppl again! Try stuff, fuck up, and don’t care what any of those dillweeds think

I think when youre young, it really feels like school is the entire universe and your whole life. But there’s more to come. 

As someone who was very shy in their youth, I wish I’d tried a little harder to push my comfort and make some friends. I’d encourage you to use this special time in your life and take risks!

you could always switch schools if you feel comfortable in that, if not the best you can do is push through it. you can always speak up about how you feel to your friends and if they are truly your friends they will try to understand you. if you really cannot handle the people in school all together you could switch to an online school where you just do the school work and not have to communicate with anyone but the teachers. but I am assuming you want to have real friends that’ll treat you normally and not like a creep or weirdo. i am also 16 and I am a girl, people don’t know me for who I really am at school at all and probably assume so much about me. the social anxiety I have doesn’t allow me to show my true personality to anyone so people just probably see me as a boring, serious and quiet person. but i think once highschool ends and i start having more experiences in life, i can make more real friends and have better social interactions. i think the same goes for you, I think you’ll be able to make better friends outside of school, a-lot of people tell me how they don’t even talk to any of the friends they made in highschool anymore anyways. i think the best thing you could do is either switch schools for a fresh start away from those rude people, or just push through the last 2 years of highschool. it’s only 2 years of your life and then you’ll have many more years to make real and loyal friends who will see you as you really are. sorry this advice is not great because I struggle myself and also have like no friends.	barpentercrut	reply	na	na	na	0.9989990592002869	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"The way your peers are treating you so insensitivly is so not okay. I understand how you must be feeling staying among such people. 

You mentioned that there were a few who took the time to talk to you and understand you. I'd say that you should keep those people in your circle and communicate with them. And when they say insensitive things which to them is a joke but to you isnt, you should tell them that. If they're really understanding people, they should get that they're making you uncomfortable. No relationship can go further if you dont understand and respect eachother. So never lower your standards, and keep trying to communicate the best way you can. 
Even with all those other people, try to express and communicate as well as you can. You're at an age when you're figuring yourself and your environment out, so its natural to try different things. Your personality isnt fixed, you have the right to try bettering yourself, even if its at communication and socialising. 

My biggest trouble at your age used to be my inability to express myself and my too kind nature. I was so bad at expressing my troubles; i was one of those people who was always smiling and lying. But i went through a difficult phase at 16, kept trying to figure out what was wrong and better myself, and it worked to a good extent. I got better at putting myself first and expressing matters i couldnt before. (But unlike you, my troubles werent about my peers. The people around me were good thankfully). 
I was trying to say that, you arent fixed to any definitions. You can explore and keep becoming better versions of yourself. As messed up as it sounds, humans are social creatures, thats why our peers and social groups can affect us so much. So its only natural that we want to have a good standing in it. But at the same time trying not to lose ourselves. 

I truly wish the best for you. Never succumb to their views of you. I know it hurts. But you'll find good people, now or later on in your life. And kids become more mature in college. In school, most are just all over the place trying to figure themseleves out and reflecting their own insecurities in the worst way."	barpentercrut	reply	na	na	na	0.9989990592002869	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"First just want to say I am so sorry you’re having this experience. I can imagine it’s hard to ignore comments like that and to feel like everyone sees you as something you’re not. I relate a lot to what you’ve said in this post, I was just like you in high school. 

You sound smart and like you know yourself and already understand how kids your age are being kids your age/bullies. Still it doesn’t make comments like “school shooter” or “kidnapper” ok. I will echo what others have said in the comments and say I think it’s a solid idea to push back when people say stuff like that. I was always taught by adults in my life to “let it go” and “be the bigger person” but I’ve learned since becoming older, there will always be someone chirping about something and while yes, sometimes it is definitely beneficial to let it go and take the high road, it is also a necessary skill to be able to shut things down because those people will try to walk on you otherwise and you need to defend yourself against them. 

A simple “shut the hell up bro” or something along those lines goes a long way I think. It doesn’t have to be over the top or some big scene but push back and defend yourself. 

Second, I would suggest leaning into the relationships with those people who take the time to get to know you. That is the biggest way I carried myself through middle and high school, amongst all the popularity contests and shit. I had my people who I loved and who loved me so it was easier to feel like I had my place and the rest of it didn’t matter. All you need is a few good people who actually see you and who you like. 

Idk for sure if you’re in the US but there is definitely an extrovert bias here. It does get better as you get older, people will stop saying things like “kidnapper” but you will still get a few “gotta watch out for the quiet ones” or things that feel weird and obtuse like you’re being singled out for just being yourself/existing. That is something you just have to decide how you’ll deal with, unless you want to try and learn ways to blend in more. You can make a joke about it, have a canned comeback, or something else but also remember that there are a ton of other people like you who are experiencing the same thing for the same reasons. It’s stupid but you’re not alone in it. I look for other quiet people to befriend because we’re already on the same wavelength with that. 

Lastly, I would see if there’s a counselor who you can talk to at school if you’re up for that. Just someone to validate your feelings and to support you and boost you up. They don’t always help but maybe that little extra support, having one more person in your corner may make a difference. Might be worth a try if that’s available to you. Also, I think it’s just worth telling an adult about all of this anyway, if you haven’t already. 

Again, I’m sorry this is happening. You sound like a good person, someone who I probably would have been friends with in HS. If all else fails, maybe try to find the humor in it and also tell them to fuck off or something. Fck them tho, seriously.

Can you join an out of school sport or hobby where you might meet different kids your age? How about a part time job, as speaking to customers may help you overcome shyness as well as meeting other people. Although school is the focus of your life now, it will pass and life always moves on. Keep busy doing things you love and don’t worry about what other people think.

i get you, it does get hard to ignore ppl not taking u srsly. i’ve literally had ppl laugh in my face while talking to me, as if talking to me was some sort of joke. my best advice is to get yourself into something outside of school. start reading, drawing, painting, anything that can get your mind off stuff. unfortunately ppl are always gonna suck, esp teen kids, so the best you can do is keep your mind off your worries. best of luck to u!!	barpentercrut	reply	na	na	na	0.9989990592002869	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

I feel like socializing in your teens usually sucks. Don’t let it get you down too much, it’s just a phase. They’ll grow up and be less annoying to be around.

"I feel you because people always did the same thing to me. Even now I still find myself feeling scrutinized and treated as a joke, sometimes even by my own friends. 

Now, I'm not going to tell you to just ignore them, because it is not easy, and completely invalidates how unfair their behavior is to you. 

Unfortunately, there aren't many ways to change your bullies' minds. I've found that with most bullies there is no way to humanize yourself to them. You will never get their validation. 

But what you can do is fortify yourself and validate your own beliefs so that what other people say about you becomes irrelevant. An exercise that I'm trying is writing down my beliefs and  values and things that are important to me on a piece of paper, and then promising myself I'm going to stick to those values, that I'm going to be honest, respectful, and empathetic no matter what other people say or do. That way, I'm less focused on what other people are saying, and more on how my actions reflect on ME as a person. 

Remember, bullies actions are a reflection of THEM, not of you. As long as you stick to what you believe in and what you feel is the right thing, you can always remind yourself that it's not your fault. 

Finally, the world is much bigger than your bullies. I felt trapped, because it was all I was surrounded by every day. But in my sophomore year, I've met so many new people and I'm surprised that there are this many kind people at my high school. Don't give up hope. There is always at least one kind person out there. 

Also, I'm not a licensed professional, but I am a 16F who has been through the same situation, and I hope this will help."	barpentercrut	reply	na	na	na	0.9989990592002869	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"You're 16. You're still at an age where you can do stupid things (and, honestly, to some extent, are expected to) without facing long lasting consequences.

With that in mind - tell people to fuck off. Let the rage out.

Seriously. Just do something so shocking and aggressively assertive that shows you aren't going to take it.

Not doing so just allows them to justify to themselves that it's acceptable to keep doing what they're doing. Because I guarantee it's not truly about you, it's probably about them posturing for laughs."	barpentercrut	reply	na	na	na	0.9989990592002869	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"Ok I'm getting up on my soapbox.


One thing I want you to do is to stop saying you're a ""failure"". No one is a failure. There are people who need help and support. Try to be nice to yourself. It takes practice, but it's helped me. I got to be about 30 years old and realized I'd been abusive to myself my whole life. It doesn't help. 

Another thing is having a hobby, activity, sport, or skill. Learn something for you. It massively helped my self esteem in high school having a sport, even though I wasn't good. 

Your self esteem is important, and it will help you weather the storm of high school and high school bullies.It gives you resilience and a different perspective. It might give you a sense of control. Hopefully you'll start to care less about them, even though they suck. There's not much anybody can do about other people's behavior, but we can change our own. We can change our behavior, and how we react.

"Yes! You said perfectly what I was having trouble expressing. There is a balance to defending yourself and I think it has to do with intention. Defend because those people are being assholes and you feel your peace is being disturbed but try not to let them control the way you feel about yourself and know that you ultimately have the power over the way you feel—not these emotionally stunted people. You never need to control someone externally to change how you feel, that being said, there is a social order to the way we interact, words mean things, these people are old enough to know that and it’s definitely reasonable to push back on those who are being shitty to you. You are not obligated to sit back and listen while someone refers to you as a school shooter and it would not make you any less moral or mature to tell them to shut the fuck up. Realistically, they are probably less likely to pick on you if they see you’re going to call them out on it.

One of my primary hobbies is computers. I love building them, and I love programming on them. Whenever I have computer-based classes (such as coding or web design), I'm typically the first one people come to for help. I don't really know why, but it has the potential to make my week. It forces me to get out of my comfort zone, while having people be grateful for my help while I do what I enjoy. I've found that helping others makes for good experiences with classmates.

The few I have made genuine bonds with are not the ones at fault for causing discomforting situations. It is typically onlookers who have nothing better to do.

Being infamous for absolutely nothing was awful. I seriously should've said something, or at least made it known to an authority figure.

The mindset that high school allows for you to make mistakes at little to no penalty is one that I see here in many replies to this thread.

"Omg that’s so stupid. Is it the same people repeatedly saying these things? The more I hear about it the more I’m feeling this is actually bullying and not just one off comments here and there like I was assuming before. If it’s repeated comments from the same people then I definitely think you should tell an adult because bullying isn’t ok at all and someone needs to give them consequences for their actions. 

Yes I just want to reiterate though that you’re not bad for not having pushed back on them before. It’s hard to do that especially if you didn’t grow up being taught to do that or have no experience with people who pick on you like mean siblings or something. Being assertive to mean people is a skill many adults even have a problem with, confrontation can be scary and hard. So don’t feel bad for not having said something before but feel empowered to make some attempts going forward to push back on stuff like that.

"I know the feeling. It's been 10 years since I've dated anyone. And I dread having to talk to any friends about their relationships or to family about ""why don't you have a wife yet."" Work kept me too busy to hold even a texting relationship. I used it as a coping mechanism to avoid the obvious fear of dating. But over the last few years working with a therapist I'm starting to get a lot more comfortable in everyday interactions and conversations with strangers. The hardest part is getting out of 10 years of dragging myself down to the point I don't even see what value I'd bring to a relationship.
It's baby steps. Just saying hello to a girl or setting up a dating profile was a big source of anxiety. Now I've done it I don't know why I was so scared. Next issue is getting a conversation with a potential partner that's actually worth something and not just pulling teeth to get a one word answer.

"The best combo was face masks plus sunglasses - I felt almost anonymous, and for me, more anonymity feels like less social anxiety.

But not only face masks can improve my self-confidence. For example, I prefer winter to summer, and one of the reasons is that the more layers of clothes I wear, the more confident I feel. In my case, it's definitely a body dysmorphia issue. Even if I have a healthy body weight for my height from the medical standpoint and I'm by no means weak as I do quite a lot of sports activity in my free time, I often feel too skinny and thus insecure.

Another advantage of winter is wearing hats - that's another confidence boost for me, as now at almost 40 I have maybe 50% of the hair I had in my 20s.

So, I think, hiding behind either face masks, sunglasses or layers of clothes seems to be a common experience for socially anxious people, especially those with body image issues."	Federal_Piglet4398	reply	na	na	na	0.012656462378799915	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

I'm a senior and everyone already has their friend groups and it's only me who's alone and knows no one.

I was so very anxious too, back then. But it went very well, so much better than I thought it would. That time also helped me getting over quite some of my anxiety.

"Okay you gotta take small steps improving in a few things if you want to get the anxiety under control.

First, try to embrace your friends. Go out with them more often and try to enjoy your time with them. There's nothing much you can do about those friends that you still feel a bit anxious other than spend time with them until you feel better about it.

If you try and take your mind off of people judging you, that will also help, because when people see that you are feeling awkward, it becomes a bit awkward to interact with you. I know it's harder to do than to say it, but you could try and talk mostly to the people you feel comfortable with and do small talk to other people when it's convenient.

Don't lose hope yet man, it gets better with time, but you do have to take those small steps whenever you can, and you will feel scared, but don't forget that being courageous is not about not having fear, but to keep going even if you fear."

i can hardly go into public places without wearing a mask anymore or sunglasses to avoid eye contact or feeling like i’m being stared at. i need to start at the gym but i’m overwhelmed by what to do and potentially being laughed at for poor form or whatever. i know everyone says it’s irrational and most likely no one is judging you but it makes me cringe even imagining myself doing certain things at the gym. any tips?:’)	bjorkchomsky	post	8.489940858458356	female	White	0.9989559650421143	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety
"I want to first say I am proud of you for asking. I know I relate and thought people at the gym were judging me harshly and my every move. I was not sure how to do certain exercises. And even when I was doing exercises from learning through the Internet, I was unsure if my form was incorrect.

What personally helped me ease my gym anxiety was having someone come with me to the gym (a gym buddy) temporarily who knew the gym better than I did. Once I got more comfortable I sought out a personal trainer, and how I'm WAY more confident.

I know personal trainers are quite pricey, hence why I'm only doing personal training for the short term. 

Also what I found was asking regulars at the gym for help also helped me. Finding someone who is friendly, and asking them hey could you help me show how to use this equipment? Etc. People are normally very happy to help because it makes them feel good about themselves, so it's a win-win.

I know I had to overcome the fear of, ""Oh I'm bothering people"" but people in my opinion are GLAD and happy to help. Another option would be to ask the workers for a retour of the gym and equipment if possible, then bring up questions. 

Most helpful: a few personal training sessions, temporary family gym buddy (or someone you feel comfortable around that can encourage you and knows the gym), and asking regulars for help/advice.

(15F) im starting public high school 10th grade in two days after not being in school (homeschooled) for 5 years and im so fucking scared. i havent been near people often in so long and i just took a small tour of the school and i couldnt stop breathing heavily there were so many people and they all looked so much older and bigger than me (ive barely grown past age 12) i dont know how im goiing to do this. im on meds (hydroxezine and lexapro but only for like 2 weeks) and i have a therapist but shes out of town for the week so iwont see her for a long time. im a really weird and weak kid and visibly so and that means im probably going to be a target for the worst things imaginable. im not sure if im ever going to be able to rejoin society after total isolation for so long. what can i do to minimize this fear???	purgatoriian	post	19.007488097222286	female	White	0.9968697428703308	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety
for me, at first it’s really scary the first couple of days but then it becomes a cycle with the same people every day. i still get social anxiety and like pain every single day but it lessens as i get used to the same system and people i see in my classes and hallways. i don’t think anyone is going to target you, as long as you keep to yourself and are kind to others then you’ll be just fine. when i got a tour of my highschool i was also struggling to breathe and felt so scared. but as the school days go by you just get used to the same thing over and over again. but there is certain times where things get really scary like presentations or group and partner work but you can always talk to your teachers or have your parents talk to them about your situation and they’ll probably be understanding and help exclude you from those things.	purgatoriian	reply	na	na	na	0.9968697428703308	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"Hey hey its okay. Youre overthinking it but also its always good not to be pushy when it comes to new friends. Let the friendship blossom naturally. All you gotta do is light the spark. If youre meeting them in person there is no need to be overly communicating on social media.  

On a side note, to calm you down and help you in the future:

Here are a few tips to know how you come across a new connection:

I call it the rule of two. 

Try twice in two separate occasions to hangout with someone, if the person does not suggest a hangout after if you did not hangout yet and its an excuse after an excuse; its a pass. Respect yourself and find people who would love to hangout with you. 

Theyre busy?:

No problem. Did they suggest an alternative date/time to hangout? 
Yes - great, thats solid and theyre interested to meet up.
No - ask them when they would be free to hangout. They let you know? Amazing! Enjoy the hangout. 
They let you know but made an excuse last minute to the time of hanging out? Skip.

I hope this helps, i know you did not ask for this but i just wanted to feel more relaxed about all this, its no biggie and youre all well :D

"I don't think people without SA understand the severity of it, or at least just how bad it can be for some of us. It's the eye of the storm, it's what I trace everything back to. It's the center of the web.

I'm 24 and live with my parents. I can't drive a car, nor do I have any more freedom than a literal child. Why? Every time I apply for jobs, I'm the first one out via process of elimination. Even if I'm lucky enough to make it as far as an interview, they immediately detect my social ineptitude and hound me out. Almost EVERY job I apply for, even the most lackluster of all, require some sort of outgoing/extroverted personality and willingness to engage with people. The extrovert bias (especially in the US) is in a class of its own, and I don't mean that in a good way.

I have next to zero fun experiences in life. All because my social anxiety grabs me by the collar, slaps me across the face a billion and one times till my brain falls out, and suddenly, I can't even remember how to pronounce a single syllable. I miss out EVERYWHERE I go. I lose opportunities like it's the fucking stock market. And I just so happen to have invested in the worst possible stocks. Even when I studied abroad in South Korea, I made a complete idiot out of myself since I hardly socialized with my roommate, who I stayed with for a whole damn month, I missed out on exploring other cities aside from Seoul while my classmates were flying over to Jeju Island and even Japan, and I stayed in almost every night while my roommate went out to explore the city. You know the best part? I actually **love** traveling and exploration, it gives me a buzz I can't quite compare to anything else; I love adventure, and yet, because I was terrified of being judged/falling into awkward situations and encountering new people, I stayed in. I only went out to explore a handful of times, but I could've done so much more. Other than that, I stay at home in my childhood bedroom escaping from realism to bask in some sort of idealism which will never actually manifest into reality because I can't talk to another human being. I'm so horrified of getting old and having done nothing. No fun scrapbooks or crazy stories, no life-changing experiences or unparalleled adrenaline rushes. I can't let that happen.

This garbage is literally selective mutism. At least for me since my case is so fucking severe. And hey, if I do dare to unbolt the forbidden entry leading to the cave of nullity, I won't even sound like myself. All I'll muster is a meek squeak, a shrill hiccup under the guise of speech. I kid you not, people have called me out on this **so. many. times.** Remarkably enough, I had a group of ""friends"" in college. Needless to say, that rodeo did not last too long before I was hurled off the mechanical bull into the Loser's Corner. One day, we were sitting around watching TV and I have no recollection whatsoever of whatever was being said to me, but I do remember being unable to mutter ANYTHING other than the mousiest, most timorous, painfully awkward ""yeah"" I've ever said in my life. They started repeating after me, mimicking the voice and laughing. That definitely wasn't one of the most mortifying days of my life. I've been told by cashiers, amusement park workers, what have you, that I look ""scared."" They'd keep probing and meddling until they found out ""why I looked so scared."" It's the fear-riddled social anxiety eyes for me. Can't hide them from anyone. And yeah, asking a paying customer why they look like they're going to pee themselves and treating them like a toddler is definitely better than just taking their goddamn order and giving them their food. Makes sense.

It makes me believe I suck compared to everybody else and that I literally don't deserve to be in their presence. That I'm unattractive and gross, so why would anyone bother wasting their time on me? I'm almost sure I qualify for avoidant personality disorder too. I have a ton of other mental illnesses and setbacks which could stem back to my social anxiety, or at least the trauma that brought it upon me. I was bullied incessantly as a kid/teen and the outcast/loner of my school until graduation day.

Because of this horrible disorder, people jump the gun and assume this is who I am. That there is no social anxiety disorder or trauma or anything to explain it. Cause let's be real, nobody wants to hear your story. They just want to play the assumptions game and categorize you, trapping you into a compact, suffocating bubble of misery.

I suck at maintaining relationships for the life of me. I can't get close to anybody. Everybody assumes either that I'm boring and not worth getting to know, or that I'm a rude person who doesn't care for them. I get overwhelmed by all these people reaching out to hang out or call me, so I end up going ghost, and guess what? When I am ready to face my fears, they've already unfriended me. It hurts like a bitch. I never hated them. I just feel so nervous around them. I wish I could tell people without it being so taboo or weird. It's the fact that if and when I do get exceptionally close to you, I'll probably get obsessive and constantly think you hate me, annoying the absolute hell out of you. Being scared everybody is going to leave. 

Like you can tell people you're shy and they won't bat an eye, but they have no idea it's possible to experience it at **this** extremity. The darkness and brutality this shit has on me is unbelievable. It's ruined my entire life.

I have no personality. I can't randomly start singing or joking or throwing around quirky little quips and puns, even though I've definitely got them up my sleeve. I can't showcase my true excitement around people. I have to be a total robot or a sheep. I can't stick up for myself whenever people are disrespectful or condescending toward me. I can't say no. I constantly disappoint everybody by falling off the face of the earth cause of the ungodly amount of alone time I need, all because I have to mentally prepare myself for weeks before socializing. Everybody either thinks I hate them, or they hate me. I can't correct the waiter when they mess up my order and end up eating something I don't really enjoy. I have a distinct personality for everybody I talk to in hopes it'll help me mesh with them, except I go so far with this I lose sight of who I am in the process and have a billion identity crises a day. I literally have no idea who I even am. I can't deal with this anymore. Fuck social anxiety."	purrnugget22	post	16.63047067612164	female	White	0.997044026851654	na	na	na	11	socialanxiety

"I was exactly like you (still kinda am) I'm working on it, very slowly but 1% progress is still progress. Some tips I can offer that I've found through my own experience:

- you have the same right as everyone else to be in a space. I tell myself this multiple times a day. ""I'm not wrong for being here"". Other positive affirmations like that. This has been a gamechanger for my social anxiety

- on that note, positive affirmations. It may sound stupid but changing how you talk to yourself really does help. Trust me. Just like go on instagram and find motivational quote or affirmation accounts, write down ones you like or that resonate with you and reread them and say them to yourself every once in a while or continue finding new ones. 

- try to recognize when you overthink. I found that ALL, and I'm not kidding, of my anxiety comes when I overthink, be it before, after, or during an interaction. If I have an unplanned interaction I'm not anxious at all until I overthink and replay it in my head after. Tell yourself not to overthink or other anxiety reducing techniques when you recognize you are overthinking

Thanks for the tips. I like the last one tbh. I’ve thought about it before, though usually when I’m observing others interact, I’m just awe-struck! Like idk, I’m frozen in time in pure and utter disbelief it comes so naturally to them. It’s not something they spend hours preparing for, nor is it something they condemn themselves for as soon as it ends, analyzing and nitpicking every flaw. Like damn do I feel cursed. Whenever I try and mimic their mannerisms, I always feel it comes off awkward and unnatural since I can’t get it quite right cause I lack the key ingredient that they all possess - confidence. That’s what I think I need to build up. You also reminded me I have a box of positive quotes/affirmations in my room. I guess I can try, it’s refreshing to know at least somebody out there has made improvements.	purrnugget22	follow-up	na	na	na	0.997044026851654	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"Some antidepressants can really alleviate social anxiety, cut off the constant inflow of intrusive self-deprecating thoughts, and decrease hypersensitivity to the social environment. They should be chosen carefully, though, as some people can develop untypical reactions to SSRIs or other types of antidepressants and there are cases when some of them increase anxiety (unfortunately, too many doctors use an overly generic approach).

On the other hand, benzodiazepines and other sedatives don't seem to be a good solution for long-term social anxiety, as they can lead to addiction and they don't address the cause of the problem.

So, antidepressants + psychotherapy seem to be a good solution for some people, as both can improve each other's effects.

From my personal experience: antidepressants, even if taken only for two or three months (formally too short, but in my case side effects, especially sleep disruption, has always been a problem), put me in a kind of auto-therapy mode where I start to see more solutions to the problems, the amount of self-deprecating thoughts decreases drastically, and I care a lot less how other people perceive me. The effect often persists for months after quitting medication. But it's important to know that the first 2-3 weeks on antidepressants can feel horrible, with elevated levels of anxiety, more mood swings, and a lot of other side effects (although this experience varies between people significantly, and some of them have almost no side effects)."

My reactions to antidepressants are definitely atypical because even the smallest doses have strong effects on my mood and, unfortunately, come with numerous side effects.

"I was on paroxetine for about 6 months on various doses. At the beginning I had some side effects: I wanted to sleep all day and my hands were sometimes twitching (it didn't hurt, it just felt weird).
Other than that I didn't see much difference. I didn't feel like it helped with my anxiety. Maybe it helped a little with my depression, I'm not sure. To be fair I sometimes forgot to take my prescription so maybe it's my fault that it didn't work too well. Anyway, when I stopped taking it I didn't get any withdrawal symptoms.
That's my experience.

But everyone is different. I read lots of messages online from people who were saying paroxetine had helped them a lot with anxiety and/or depression, so you could give that or other SSRIs a try and hopefully you'll be one of these people.

"I keep messing up. I keep having to own up to it and embarrassing myself for shit that I should know.

I clean in a hospital and at first I just thought the people around me were nitpicky. 

“I think you forgot to get my trash.”
“You didn’t clean my room yet.”
“I need paper towel!”

But now I know it’s just me. 

My manager keeps telling me to clean rust out of the showers and I’ve done it multiple times already. Maybe I just don’t know how it’s supposed to look (because I don’t do that in my own home) or maybe I’m half-assing it.

I was never taught how to remove biohazard material and instead of bothering others, I just waited until someone else could do it. That is until a nurse got upset with me about it because her boss yelled at her for it. I was shaking and couldn’t speak right and she just talked over me. She couldn’t tell me what I needed to know so I wasted 20 minutes going on a witch hunt for the right materials which I had to bother ANOTHER person for 😫. And then I had to take another 10 minutes trying to figure out how to change the stuff. I’m just mad because I was embarrassed but I did something dangerous instead of just asking.

I got my first complaint before the last incident about multiple problems (no extra tissue, pee still on the floor, crumbs still on the floor). And this was the patients words Now I don’t usually clean top to bottom every room, but I was sure I cleaned in there. I stopped my break to clean the room because I couldn’t go through with it with that on my mind. When I went back there was nothing wrong just some paper on the floor and no extra tissue (which I didn’t know was a requirement). I’ve gotten plenty of compliments before, but I was worried because my manager was never sent that stuff. Hell, the woman that did a bad job training me doesn’t clean anything, just gives an illusion and gets many compliments because of her personality.

The last time (today), because of the report to my manager, I vowed to clean every room top to bottom no matter how long it took. I even tried to make it smell good by using bleach, but then everyone complained about how slippery the floors were (even though it wasn’t to me) and the fall concerns. Then I searched if bleach could cause it and it could, but it’s irreversible.  So I just did all that extra work for nothing and put something extra on the people they were trying to get to fix it.

So 1. I put people in danger 
2. I might get fired for all of this
3. I did something extra I thought would be positive but was negative instead
4. I never wanted to do this in the first place

I can really relate to this. I think the best thing you can do is not beat yourself up for it (You seem to realize a number of these were you trying your best and unforeseen circumstances hitting you later) and giving it a little more time to see if you can get used to it, as well as trying to give yourself more grace for asking for help. Your superiors should be willing to help ensure you know how to do the job, and if not, that's them doing something wrong. If it continues not working out, I also feel you should try to look for different work. Best of luck, I know all of this is easier said than done, considering I'm struggling with a lot of the same, but I'm hoping you can find some level of comfort either there or somewhere else so work isn't an endless cloud of stress.

I had some friends in middle school by some stroke of luck who put up with my awkwardness enough for me to get comfortable around them, but after moving to another state right before high school, I haven’t really had any real friends since. I struggled a lot with depression in high school and really genuinely dreaded the idea of going through more of that with college, so after 3 quarters of my first year, I dropped out to pursue freelance programming work. I have zero idea how but that actually worked out, so now I’ve got an okay-paying full time job. I live with my parents still, relationship with them is great, they’re super supportive as long as I’m working and helping with stuff around the house, so that’s all good.  
​  
I guess that’s the problem though. Outside of immediate family, I really have no one. I was too anxious, awkward, and honestly terrified to talk to people in high school, I dropped out of college, and now I’m working full time from home. I mean, this genuinely was my dream job and I’m really so lucky to even have stable income, but I really feel like I really, really fucked up - or like I’m fucked up, I guess. I’ve completely cut myself off from most normal social outlets (college/work), but even if I hadn’t, I’d probably be too anxious to meet anyone anyway. I guess that’s what I’m really worried about, that I actually never will, that I’ll feel this alone forever. I know I have to do something about it if I want that to change, but I don’t even know where to start, or if I even can fix it (fix me) at this point.  
​  
I don’t know what to do. I spend all my time in my room at home, working 8 hours a day, then working on personal art projects for another 4-6 hours, then gaming/YouTube/whatever for another 2-4. I have close internet friends that I talk to on the daily and have for years, and I feel like that’s the only thing that keeps me sane sometimes lol. But I mean, man, as much as I love them… it isn’t nearly enough. We play games and watch movies and just chat together all the time over voice calls, and I feel somewhat okay while that’s going on, but then the call ends and it’s just me again. As close as we are, it’s still just me, sitting at my desk, talking to a piece of metal and staring at a computer screen. I leave my house maybe once or twice a week on average, sometimes less, very rarely more, and only when I’m going places with my family. I try to do things with the family whenever I’m feeling up to it (going out for dinner, seeing movies, whatever), so I at least get out some (and also get to spend some time with them - as much time as I spend at home, 90% of it is still alone in my room), but again, it just isn’t enough. I don’t have my driver’s license because 1. I get terrible anxiety while driving and 2. I don’t even have anywhere to go, so I haven’t bothered getting it yet (not really a valid excuse but still lol). And like, writing all this stuff out about not leaving the house, not having a license at 22, having no friends since middle school… it’s honestly really embarrassing, it hurts to type all this out. I hate that I’m like this, I hate that I’ve messed up so badly that this is where I’m at at this point. When 16 year old me was terrified to make friends in high school, I feel like he’d be heartbroken to hear where he’s at 6 years later. I’m really ashamed of that, and honestly terrified that it’s not going to change - that I’ll never find any friendships, any relationships, any… anything. I think I’ve been a lot more lonely since middle school than I’ve realized, and lately it’s been weighing on me a lot more. Even if I went back to college (which even aside from the whole social anxiety thing, I really don’t wanna do) or found some in-person work somewhere, I’m still the same awkward anxious mess of a person that couldn’t make a single friend throughout the entirety of high school. I’ve been alone like this for like 10 years now. I feel like I’ve both fucked up way too much and I am way too fucked up at this point to really fix things, and I really really hate feeling that way.  
​  
At some point early next year, I’m planning to meet up with some of my close internet friends. That’s also terrifying and really anxiety-inducing to me, but I really desperately need to do something. Even still though, I really don’t think that’s enough - going and meeting some friends across the country for a few days, and then just going back home and returning to my normal life, completely alone, again.  
​  
Sorry again for the really rough, poorly written, long wall of text. I’m kind of a mess right now, I’d go back and try to proofread and clean up everything a bit but I cringe reading anything I write so it’s probably best that I don’t, otherwise I’ll probably just end up never even posting this lol. Again, I have no idea what I’m really expecting to get out of this, but any input, thoughts, or encouragement would really mean a lot. I’ve honestly been doing really rough lately and could use any guidance I can get. Thanks so much either way, hope you all are doing well and taking care."

"I don't want to sound insensitive but I started chuckling halfway through reading this, this is so relatable! I'm 21, studying software engineering, but I haven't really made any friends in college (despite people being really nice, I just didn't make the effort to keep in touch), I also spend my days coding, drawing, gaming and reading. I rarely go out. I don't have driving licence either because my brain is telling me I have to know how to drive BEFORE I attend, because you know, embarassing to be new and not good at something (delusional).

To me the fact that you've managed to make online friends sounds like you might not be as awkward as you think you are. Sounds like they genuinely like you if you're keeping in touch regularly.
Meeting new people is always scary, but it's amazing that you're pushing yourself! I hope you guys have fun. I hope some of them live in your area so you could meet up more regularly in person too.

Also congrats on getting your dream job! You must be good at what you're doing.

You got this, 22 is young. There's still time."	UhhhIDunnoChief	reply	na	na	na	0.9962847232818604	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
Start small! If you have a laptop you could try working at public places. It's important to put yourself in the same environment as other people. Go for walks, try new things. You don't have to strike up conversations, just get outside more frequently and get used to it. You will start to notice how people talk and befriend each other, people will have small exchanges with you and it'll get easier with time. Use your loneliness for your advantage. It's wonderful to be able to look at things at your pace, to observe and to learn from everything that surrounds you. Do this and enjoy, everything else will follow.

"I get how having friends whom you can meet up with often is good and energizing. Why dont you try making online friends that live near you, if thats possible? I find it easier to make friends online myself. And you seem to be really good at it if you contact them everyday and even talk to them. Thats something i cant make myself do yet. 
So if you got to make friends near you, you can meet up with them often as well. 
And then another important thing is to go outside, just working outside in a cafe with your laptop as another person here said would be great. Your current greatest disadvantage is working from home. It makes you stagnant. Humans are social beings, that why not having a social network and friends bother us so much. So you need to make that happen for yourself, go out into the social environment. Only then can you meet people and  make changes in your life.
And true, those social situations make you anxious but you're not feeling good where you are right now either. So why not try putting yourself through that anxiety, and something good could happen out of it. Infact I'm sure something will eventually. Take that chance. 

And yess, go meet them online friends in person! Thats how it goes. You're doing it right. You might have to push yourself but you're ready to do it and thats great! 

And another important bit i believe is to be happy on your own as well. It seems like when you are on your own, maybe because of all those 10 years of experiences you mentioned, you have made yourself believe its so unnatural and wrong. Like being on your own should make you feel bad about yourself? 
Because absolutely not. Its two different things -- being happy with people and being happy on your own. You should be able to do both. If you cant find peace in being with yourself, you'll have a hard time, i swear. 

It took me so long to find peace with myself. For the longest time i had no self value or worth, i found myself weird and etc. But eventually i was able to figure out who i am and be happy about it. Your hobbies, desires, strengths, weaknesses - all of them define who you are and you should embrace all of it. Accept that you are introverted, socially anxious but loves video games, art...those are all important parts of your identity. Seek people who get that, value that. You're just 22 (me too), an age you're still figuring things out and making social connections. I know i have a long way to go myself. But again, we're just 22. What matters is that you're self aware and that you want to get better. Keep figuring yourself out, embrace who you are and push your limits! Goodluck! ♡"	UhhhIDunnoChief	reply	na	na	na	0.9962847232818604	weak	strong	strong	na	socialanxiety
"go volunteer (animal shelter/food pantry/hospital), take a class at community college (photography/cooking/whatever), go to a gym - try your local hospital, they usually have a gym that isnt full of bros or try marital arts, go back to school part time, get certified to teach english as a second language, 

You need to get your license. Study and get your permit then sign up for lessons. Usually they will test you as well. If you cant do this on your own, go see a dr and a therapist."	UhhhIDunnoChief	reply	na	na	na	0.9962847232818604	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"First of all, I know I can't speak for your own 16 yo self, but just reading what you wrote, I felt a sense of progression. You have friends, a job, no a career, good family relationship. Maybe your progress is slower than you would have wanted, but you didnt just graduate high school, didnt just drop out of college and then stagnate. Youre still moving forward, which is sweet. 

I understand your feeling youve been stuck for like 10 years, but I think you do have something to start being proud of, right now, right this second.

And youre aware of the unhappiness you feel, at 22, when it could have been slowly building numbness till you were much older. This is a good time to realize you want to do better.

My 2 cents, and yeah, I'm still figuring shit out myself, so i don't wanna be a hypocrite, is like meetups groups or dating sites? I just posted on here about my dating site troubles. However, while I was looking and struggling to find women I could connect with to date last year, I made a friend on that dating site that is now a really good friend of mine that relates to me really well even on issues like this. 

She even invited me to a meetup group for 20s/30s people who have social anxiety, and I made another friend there. She wouldve had a pretty tough time going there by herself, even though everyone there was supportive. So I helped her by being with her, and she helped me by getting me to go. And we chatted about our experiences on the drive back.

Then she had been wanting to learn rock climbing, but her social issues made that hard when she went to a meetup. So I went with her the next time, and it was one of my favorite memories in years, and she got to achieve something thanks to me being there with her. 

So wtf is my point? I guess like, I have something to start building on, some support to branch out with. That's a goal for you maybe, find someone irl who's like you, who you can just be like ""yo sometimes Im anxious, sometimes Im depressed, you get that right?"". 

And don't knock dating sites for finding friends? idk. depending on your area. But yeah, she and i support each other with our struggles. They're still there, but we have each other to fall back on when things get tough. And she knows I get depressed and adhd and just cease all nonessential contact with other humans for weeks or months on end sometimes, but she understands.

So dating sites, meetup groups, local reddits for your city? Discord servers for meeting up? Find someone to show or do your art projects with? Maybe the license would help. I got mine a few years older than you. Man i miss not having a car, no car expenses, not needing to drive, etc. 😢 

But i was just thinking, like fuckin meetup groups for people who ride bicycles could be an idea for you (aw man I just remembered at that social anxiety meetup group there was randomly this like, this train of legit must have been 100 people that rode on bicycles past the park that day lol. Like there was a bicycle meetup in that area at the same time). Someone else here mentioned volunteering, which ive heard before, and that reminds me i keep forgetting to fuckin call the food pantry local to me to try and volunteer there.

Thanks for sharing your story and for wishing us well, that's dope of you. i hope posting this is at least starting to be helpful and our suggestions get your brain juices flowing a little."	UhhhIDunnoChief	reply	na	na	na	0.9962847232818604	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"And just one last random thought, idk your gender or orientation or if you even have romantic/sexual interests in mind. but I just remember being at a party a friend invited me to when i was your age. He had to help do something somewhere in that house cause it was his frat's party, so I was alone for like 90+ minutes, just wandering around being socially anxious around all these girls I found attractive, worried Id go the whole night not talking to anyone. Id talk to people here and there and tried to tell them i was socially anxious, just to like, shake off the shame you know? the anxiety about being socially anxious? but those conversations were super like, distant.

then after a long ass time, i remembered i had previously read on some dating site, this tip i read for socially anxious people to talk to people they find attractive. So i just started tapping girls on the shoulder, holding my hand out like Id shake their hand, and then Id suddenly start wordlessly thumb wrestling with them. And that got really enjoyable for the like half a dozen women i did that with, i wouldn't actually say anything but they would laugh, start conversations, introduce me to their friends and we'd share a moment. i started relaxing and having fun at the party. and yeah, eventually i did engage in uhh, various consensual physical intimate activities with a couple of girls that night, but the point is i was so relieved just to minimum not just go to that party and just be anxious and alone for 3 hours lol. And i thought it was cool to use an ice breaker, conversation starter like that. 

idk if you get anything from that story lol"	UhhhIDunnoChief	reply	na	na	na	0.9962847232818604	no	strong	strong	na	socialanxiety
I found this because I searched “22 and no friends”. Because I am also 22 with no friends. I move to Scotland last August and left behind all my old friends who live 450 miles away and since then we don’t talk. I have a long distance boyfriend, but he has a lot of friends. Outside of family, work and my boyfriend I have no one. My boyfriend has a very fulfilling social life and sees his friends daily and goes on holidays with them. I see no one but colleagues and family and as you can imagine do not go on holiday with anyone either. Anyway what I’m saying is it sucks a fucking lot. And I’m really really lonely too. I cry sometimes at night thinking about it. But it reassured me to read I’m not the only 22 year old like this, when it feels like everyone else has friends!

I really needed to hear this, thank you. I don’t know why but I really don’t think I’ve looked at it that way until I read your comment. I use “it makes me anxious” as an excuse to not do so many things, but at the same time… I’m not doing great, so clearly the alternative isn’t a whole lot better lol.

"I am at work and I’m stocking pillows. I left the backroom with the pillows on my u boat and my crush said “Wow we sell a lot of pill pillows here” and I said “We do, and it’s really annoying to stock so many of them” (because their packaging is very slippery and they keep falling off my cart). She said “it must be a very profitable business, no wonder there was such a scandal with the mypillow guy.” And as I was trying to awkwardly navigate my cart around them I just said “…yeah!”
There was also someone waiting on me to move so I had to get outta the way. 

I wish I had some kind of clever comment to say back. But I’m just awkward around my crushes. I couldn’t think of what to say in the moment.

"I wonder if anyone experienced this. 
You have bunch of people who normally don't talk to you and are usually loud/extroverted/popular

Then one day for some reason they approach you and start conversation, asking questions etc. If you put this conversation to written form, everything might seem almost normal. But in reality you see this bunch of people are actually being ironic/sarcastic and  their interest is fake, only to have some kind of fun?

This one guy, for example, when we were in a group setting would find someone that he though was weird and incessantly start asking them questions but with a sarcastic tone, looking for reactions from the group. He had an eye for insecure people, idk. To then drop them like “ok I’m ni longer interested in you, you can go” 

It’s disgusting behavior, after I saw it happen a 2nd time I left that friend group because everyone there seemed to find it amusing?

I feel so unliked and unloved especially recently.  I always feel like everyone is judging me , just thinking very negative of me , that they can notice my anxiety.  I feel very worthless as a person,  i feel like i don't matter and just like no one likes or loves me.  Also like everyone's laughing or making fun of me. Idk I just don't feel normal like others,  I feel very different and abnormal.  Literally went to church earlier for the first time cause of this but finally did and even there I felt like all of this,  even worse....proud of myself for finally going though,  I been wanting to go for awhile but again SA was stopping me.  I also have a blushing problem which I absolutely hate , I didn't btw,  I was trying very hard not to. Anyway idk what the hell's wrong with me? Is this low self esteem? Is it connected with SA?

I don’t have answers but just want to say I relate to this a lot. I think a large part of it is confidence - people who are loud and annoying are usually confident and people gravitate towards them. But saying that if these loud people are the ones I know, some of people who gravitate are fake and don’t actually like them lol.

"
I am 21 years old and have struggled with social anxiety since I was 13/14. and just found out that I'm not really afraid of what others think of me, I'm more afraid of what I will think of myself in a way. I am afraid of rejection, but it’s rather rooted in a fear of being who I was before, a me that I hate. And it seems to be the real me. This disorder protects me from being who I was before, but I am miserable in my life right now. . I also have adhd and started having social problems when I was 14. I got involved in a gang that I didn't fit in, I was terribly insecure about myself, I felt so extremely ugly and everything in my head was chaos, I cared extremely about what other people thought. felt like everyone was on the same page, while I felt like a little insecure child who wasn't keeping up with developments. I acted out, I said childish things, I didn't understand what the girls were talking about, it seemed like adult stuff to me. nevertheless, I don't know if this is due to ADHD, or if I'm just completely broken as a person. 

The reason I hate the way I was is because I was so weird and awkward and so insecure. I was the only one acting like I did, I told people how I was feeling and said a lot of embarrassing and revealing things. It had a huge emotional impact and and i still feel the same feelings towards myself but I hide it and deny. But I am terrible at making friends, I always put on a mask to hide my deeply insecure real self, that makes it impossible to make friends. I am so afraid to let me be the way I am, it feels like i will expose awkward things about myself and be perceived as useless and inept like I was before. But I have no idea how to fix it, I try to do erp but the persona I have developed is too deeply rooted and weakens progress. If you have some tips, anything’s, I would deeply appreciate it. ♥️"	BodybuilderRecent726	post	14.070819889287652	female	White	0.9901881814002991	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety
"Hey i am so sorry that you are going through all of that and had to live with it for so long.

Look, i think the main thing is that you need to accept your true self. If you don't care or understand what the other girls are talking about, then you clearly don't belong there, and that's nothing to be ashamed or afraid of. Different people have different personalities and we all have things we like and dislike and i think you were in the wrong group in the wrong time.

One of my best friends is 5 years younger than me, i was already working while he was still in high school, but we are really good friends and have a bunch of things in common. When i try to talk to people ""my age"" i feel completely left out, i just don't understand or don't care about the things they say, but when i talk to my friend, we are 100% on the same page and it's just so much better.

I don't share the same mentality as the other people my age and that's completely fine, i just gotta stick together with the people that do like the same things as me to trully belong there, but also to trully be myself.

I know it can be hard to find people that you can connect with, but that's what you should be trying to do. If you find a group where you don't belong, then don't try to belong there, go find other people that really care about you and about the things you love."

"I'm just so sick of people trying to tell me that what I'm feeling isn't that bad and that it's easy to overcome if I want to. Like I was at a 2-day overnight camp with some school friends, but being in a large group with so many people was difficult and scary, especially because I felt ignored and excluded by everyone. I told one of my ""friends"" that I felt scared to talk to people and being in such a large group was causing me to panic. I told her it was scary and she just went ""no it's not""

It also sucks because I saw another girl there who was scared of heights. She panicked when we went ziplining. She was drenched in sweat, shaking, could barely move, yet nobody was telling her to just get over it, or that it wasn't that scary, but they were cheering her on. Nobody knew that for the past three days I had been feeling exactly how that girl felt, except I felt like that when other people were near me.

I wish somebody understood just how bad social anxiety can get, how it seems to turn everything you know against you and not only give you the exact same feeling as any other anxiety, but also makes you feel like an outsider in your own life."

I believe social anxiety elicits the same fight-or-flight response that causes the respective symptoms as other anxieties and phobias. This is why exposure therapy is used, as you need to train your body to not enter a fight-or-flight state for things that aren't actually threats. I am not a licensed mental health professional.

It’s different because your type of fear is something that most people experience and overcome in childhood. It’s not a fear of something that poses danger to you, it a fear of your own feelings in a situation. The way most people overcome this fear is by experiencing these situations often enough that they become desensitized to it. Other people are afraid of things that are dangerous to them, so it is usually not something that they intentionally experience due to the risks involved. In some cases, such as extreme sports, the same method is used to overcome fear. I suggest you start slow, maybe in a medium sized group and work up to bigger groups of people you are less familiar with. High school theatre class did wonders for me, because it was happening regularly and I was forced into situations where everyone was focused on me while I made mistakes. Real life was easy after theatre, I also made a bunch of friends and a had a lot of fun. Maybe try something like that?	Fit_Vermicelli7749	reply	na	na	na	0.9985325336456299	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"I think most people would say that they care for people that have social insecurities, that they respect those people with their insecurities.

But in my experience the majority does not care at all. I think it's because most don't know how it feels like to feel insecure about the most trivial things. They can't just imagine feeling weird about looking in other people's faces/eyes, feeling weird about how you walk or sit. Most people just look at each other while talking without even thinking about it. They just walk without waste a single thought about how it looks for others. They just sit in public, like they do when being alone. 

And this is completely fine. I just have the feeling when people say they respect people with strong insecurities. Most actually don't even know what it really means. And most people would never want to become friends with a insecure person. The more we have to appreciate the people, who actually willing to be our friends.

"Now, I am someone who does not like going to places where there are a lot of people, but my psychologist says that in order for my social phobia not to worsen, I need to go out frequently, so I did that — I went with my mom yesterday.  
  
Me being CF and diagnosed with social phobia… I do not like to interact with children, especially those who are really, really talkative. Well, I did not have luck yesterday. I just went inside a pet store to look at some hamsters, mice, and other animals (and yes, I am that pets>children person). So I had my target - I needed to get to the back of the store where those animals are.  
  
But the little girl walking opposite me (and whose parents were behind her but did not pay that much attention to this whole ordeal) noticed me. Oh no... She started waving her hand and saying, ""Hi!""Hi"" HIiiiii"" so many times. I pretended I did not see her and walked straight beside her to get to my destination. I was already overwhelmed by the noises, lights, smell... and other interactions from the previous three stores we visited that I just needed to get from her - from this whole situation. What was worse was that my mom was right behind me. But she, thankfully, did not comment on what happened.   
  
I am glad that some children are enthusiastic to greet other people, even though they are strangers, however I was not that kind of child when I was her age - my mom says often how I was asocial as a kid... and I am still like that.  
I just hope I did not crush the little girl's enthusiasm that day... but I just can not help myself in those situations."	Big-Competition-3714	post	26.22420308882401	female	White	0.9983887672424316	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety
"Please don’t beat yourself up about this. I have  children just like that little girl and they have never remembered a single time someone ignored them. It has happened many times and when my oldest was old enough to ask why I just told him some people don’t want to stop and chat and explained that he should only try once or at most twice to greet someone. 

Plus if you had greeted her she might’ve touched or followed you and it sounds like you don’t need that. My 4 year old does that. He will put a hand on people that are friendly in response. Sometimes even trying to crawl in their lap if they have kids of their own that are sitting with them or just wandering off after them if he wants to respond and they are moving away. It’s mortifying and he doesn’t listen so I just have to grab him when I notice him getting along with someone.

Last year my father made me do driving classes so I could get my license. I didn't really want to do it, but I gathered some courage and started the lessons. My driving instructor was a very typical Brazilian male (I'm Brazilian), poor, divorced, right-wing and a lover of alcohol. Although it was stressful, I managed to get through all the lessons reasonably, partly because my instructor wasn't that serious of a person. What happened, however, was that in the last day of the lessons he chose to get a day off and another instructor covered for him, one that had very strict standards and had the most unkind manners. It was a nightmare. I got anxious and messed up every single thing he asked me. Some of these things I really didn't know how to do because turns out the other instructor didn't teach me shit. It was probably the most humiliating, horrible experience in my life. This gave me a trauma about driving, but I thought I was fine and it was just a bad day, thought I was ok to do the test and just had to watch some videos on the stuff I messed up. So I went to do the test a month later and as soon as I got in the car with the examiner by my side I got really nervous. I tried to get the maneuver right but messed up again and he just said I might get out of the car because there was no point in proceeding with the test. I felt so bad. Since then I dread driving a car and don't want to redo the test. The problem is my father doesn't know any of this (and if he knew he probably wouldn't understand) and he still thinks I will redo the test after some additional lessons (please no). At the moment I'm just waiting for the end of the year, when my driving license process will expire. When this happens, I'll have to face my father and my family about this and to be honest I don't know what I should do. Maybe I could heal from this trauma but certainly not in half a year, so doing the test again is not an option. I agreed to the lessons because I wanted to alleviate my father's burden of having to drive me and my mother around all the time but I ended up wasting his money and I feel bad about it. And now I have to think about a way of telling him that I'm dead afraid of sitting on the driver's seat and that I won't get my license.

"That substitute driving instructor was unprofessional and a jerk, so don’t be so hard on yourself. 

Has your father helped you with your driving at all? I could be wrong, but I think most parents prepare their kids for the driving test by practicing together. The more practice you get, the better. 

Mine let me do the driving on short trips to the grocery store. First during the day only, and then a few times at night. Funny thing is they caused more anxiety if anything, but the extra practice made me more comfortable with the actual driving part. By the time I took the test, it was still very stressful, but less stressful than driving with my parents in the car. It wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. Still bad, but at least 5x less bad. 

The DMV examiner for my road test was nice so that helped a lot. They will try to remind you to relax and try your best. If you mess up on a step, they will sometimes ask you to try again. Its in their best interest (and yours) that you are cool and collected because their lives are in your hands during the test. Past coworkers have told me that the examiners at Detran are the same."

He didn't help me, but I think if he did it would be worse. He can't keep his calm with these things. My brother got his license and quit driving right after because he almost had a major crash because my father said he could go and there was actually a car coming. Unfortunately, my examiner wasn't nice. At least in Northern Brazil, people like to make things harder, especially in jobs where they have some power over others.

"I’m sorry to hear that, but I can understand how that goes…for both situations you just mentioned. 

I learned a lot about driving by watching others drive while I was a passenger in their car. I would practice doing what I would do if I were in the driver’s seat. 

If we were changing lanes, as soon as the driver hit their turn signal, I would check the mirror and look over my shoulder in that direction. If we came to a 4 way stop sign, I would look left, then right, then left again to check for traffic. I would practice right of way in my head. In those situations. If you’re not sure, you can always wave to the other cars to go ahead of you. 

If we were in a parking lot, waiting to turn onto a fast road with oncoming traffic, I would check for traffic with the driver, and keep track of how fast  cars were coming, and keep track of how much distance was needed before we pulled out into traffic. After a while of doing things like that, you get a better feel for the flow of traffic as a driver even though you’re not actually driving. Its best to watch a professional driver like a bus driver. Keep track of their head, and then the way they maneuver the bus. You decide in your mind what you would do, and a few moments later you will see what they do and it will tel you whether you were right or wrong. 

A couple of years after getting my license at 16, i got a speeding ticket. I had to attend traffic school and that really helped a lot because they focused on defensive driving. I would highly recommend you take a class or watch some videos on YouTube about it. The material they cover for defensive driving can provide some confidence in yourself to make good decisions while driving. Its mostly about being comfortable operating a vehicle, and being a part of traffic as opposed to fighting it. 

One other thing a lot parents do here is take their kids to a big parking lot early in the morning before businesses open. You can practice a lot of things without so much stress. There’s way less social anxiety involved because if you go out early enough, there wont be anyone else around. You just need to find someone willing to take you. If you can get your parents to do it, it will be way less stress for them too."	Subject-Luck5826	reply	na	na	na	0.9992581009864807	strong	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
I just went to a work party, and I've never felt more discouraged. Instead of enjoying time with people I know, I just lived in fear of their judgement the whole time. Even the moments were everyone is laughing are still fight or flight moments for me. It's like I can never relax. Every conversation i involve myself in ends up feeling like a threat. I don't know where to go from here. Every time I put myself out there like this, it just backfires and gives me more stress each time.	tsn_03	post	7.827132193379832	female	White	0.9994953870773315	na	na	na	3	socialanxiety

For example, I always instinctively hide my phone screen, turning it away, from even my best friends. Whenever it comes to me talking about my hobbies or things I like, I keep it vague to not be made fun of. At the gym I have very closed body language and feel like people's eyes are on me judging me for not knowing my whole way around and for not doing things right. Despite me putting bumper stickers on my car I'm still pretty embarrassed about those but that's an exposure I deliberately did. And now I'm trying to wear more shirts about my special interests in public without using closed body language. Basically, I just want to be myself, even if it's cringy, because the alternative is not fun. What kind of exposures can I do for this?	darkkoffeekitty	post	24.528915635566886	male	White	0.024382267147302628	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety
"Speaking from a very generalized perspective, not knowing what it is that you are filtering about you, the thing I have learned in life that all of the stories we tell ourselves in our minds are just that stories.  
As a coach, I have had so many clients who hold an entire conversation in their minds and then never engage in the conversation because they ""know"" the result.  
I would like to share a personal experience to illustrate.  


As a woman, one of the many things I was taught was to always look your best and how important looking attractive is.  This message is still strong, but is shifting in today's climate.  
For many years I would not dare to leave my house without making sure that I had makeup on and my hair done.  Nothing super fancy, but I was sure I would receive smirks or some type of negative feedback.

As time went on and I began to evaluate this message I decided that I had to step out and take different actions if I were to ever get over this belief.  You mightd be surprise how much time it can take to do hair and makeup for a woman.

I decided that the only way for me to overcome this fear was to start going out in public without looking ""perfect"".  It took a while for me to feel comfortable with this, but what happened was so liberating.  Nobody even cared.  I realized that people didn't care, and if someone did, so what.  It didn't change me or my world. 

It was so fascinating to discover that the belief systems my well meaning authority figures had in my life were now a detriment to my authenticity.  I know that when we feel discord that is when we need to make change.  How to do that can be a challenge and I think it is extraordinary that you are being vulnerable enough to reach out for assistance.

I can now run out and do errands and be my authentic self, whatever I am feeling for the day.  Whatever you are doing that you feel inauthentic in, demand to allow yourself the gift of being who you are.  What is it that you most want to shift at this time.  Journal and write the many things you could do to shift that.  Then start taking action.  One step at at time if that is what it takes.

When you engage in activities again and again, they get less scary and become less fear based.  This has been a great strategy for me and my clents.  The more you engage in an action the easier it is to do next time until, hopefully, you no longer have to give it any thought.

I hope you find this of value.  Good Luck!!"	darkkoffeekitty	reply	na	na	na	0.024382267147302628	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

the issue with alcohol is that the lessening of the anxiety is only temporary. if you only learn to be socially functional while drinking, it’s not gonna be fun when your sober. you do not want to have to rely on alcohol to be able to socially function. i think for a temporary fix sure, but be careful with it (apologies with wording, a lil sleepy. i’m sure someone will word this better than me)	LifeguardDry1277	reply	na	na	na	0.9982247948646545	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety
Solid no from me, it’s only a temporary relief. You will feel worse the next day. Also, it’s not worth the potential dependency. I can see someone potentially using cannabis for treating it, but not alcohol personally, not that weed doesn’t have its own risks and problems however if your going to self medicate it’s a much safer choice compared to alcohol.

"It definitely reduces my inhibitons but they just come roaring back afterwards, including worry about how I behaved while under the influence of the alcohol. As a solution, it's a really shit one.

CW: thoughts of self-harm
 
TL;DR: recent events have gotten me bummed out with dating/romance, how do I make something work with someone

I’ve never had much luck with women. I never had a girlfriend in high school, and after one too many in-person rejections, I switched over to doing online dating almost exclusively when I was 23. With online dating, I’d build up the women I was attracted to into wonderful partners in my head, and I’d fantasize about being in a relationship with them - but then I’d meet them in person, and we’d have zero chemistry, or they’d find someone else before I could work up the courage to message them. If they (online dating or people I know in real life) just wanted to stay friends, I’d stay friends with them, because people keep telling me that a lot of great relationships start out as great friendships - but nothing romantic ever came out of any of them. The only people who ever seemed interested in me were women that I wasn’t attracted to. At one point, when I was 23, I felt particularly burned out and drained, and felt like each new rejection had physically taken ten years off of my life expectancy. I started to think that I might actually end up alone. I even toyed with the thought of just giving up entirely, because instead of worrying day and night about whether or not girl of the week was attracted to me, I’d have the comfort and security of \*knowing\* that I’d end up alone. Besides, some of the happiest, most satisfying, most fulfilling periods of growth in my life have been when I was single and not actively looking for a partner.
  

  
Then, in 2019/2020, after fantasizing about a girl for a long time, not receiving a response when I finally worked up the courage to message her, and feeling empty for months afterwards, lockdown happened. After having had to work numerous Production Assistant jobs that I was frankly embarrassed to still have to do (I still wasn’t in the union at this point), I was out of work for months. This is incredibly privileged of me to say, but it was good for me. I was able to rest, take time off from dating, and get caught up watching movies and tv series I’d been meaning to see. After talking to my psychiatrist, I also agreed to go back on medication - more specifically, I started taking Zoloft for anxiety. It was an absolute game-changer for me.
  

  
Then, towards the end of 2020, I went back to work, and working on film sets / watching movies / working on my own editing projects became my main priority. I actually started seeing a girl through CoffeeMeetsBagel, first through Google Meets, and then in person. She was fun to hang out with, and we moved onto making out by the third-in person date and touching her breasts / my groin by the fourth in-person date, but in March 2021, after the fourth in-person date (seven dates total), she cut things off because I didn’t communicate or text enough. It bummed me out for a bit, but that’s mostly because I was shocked that she was the one to end things - to be honest, I wasn’t really physically attracted to her, and I had a hard time picturing a future with her. She talked about children (she wants to be a teacher) \*constantly\*, even mentioning in our last date how she wanted to adopt children. All in all, even though I was sad, I realized it was probably for the best.
  

  
From that point forward, dating took the back burner. I haven’t gone on a date, virtually or in-person, since. I worked as a COVID PA on a feature film for months, and used the enormous amount of free time the job gave me to edit a trailer-style video mashup tribute to Ari Aster, one of my favorite directors. It’s not perfect, it’s probably too long, and not many people have seen it, but I’m so incredibly proud of it, and even prouder that I had the skills to will it into existence. There was even a cute Scenic Artist I made a point to talk to while doing the rounds at my job, and she inspired a screenplay idea that I have yet to actually write, but it feels like I can almost touch it, it feels so within the realm of possibility (much to my dismay, she already had a boyfriend). I repeatedly began to compile movie clips for future director mashup tributes, only to get distracted by downloading movies from other directors.
  

  
Late 2021 to 2023 proved to be enormously transformational. I started using more groan-inducing puns at work, and found that it made me more comfortable around people (or among people on film sets, at least), and that helped me develop my sense of humor in general. On one gig in September 2022, I even meet a girl who I thought was cute, who liked Ari Aster movies, and who laughed at my jokes - but that was for one day, and because she doesn’t have a huge social media presence, I haven’t interacted with her since, so I mostly just pine from afar. I finally moved out of my childhood home in late October 2022, after an acquaintance / friend / something in between of mine from high school posted on Facebook looking for a roommate in Somerville. At one Production Assistant gig, I finally met someone in my craft in IATSE who expressed willingness to sponsor me - I was finally accepted into the union on April 25th, 2023, after almost four and a half years of trying to get in. Hell, I even managed to (kind of) curb my porn addiction, to the point where I don’t even really look at porn that much anymore (but that was only because I freaked out upon realizing that I’d spent nearly half my nest egg on OnlyFans custom videos - and I’m still waiting on four of them! 😬). Work is slow because of the writers’ strike, I’m a little concerned about how much money is in my bank account, and I’m not doing as many creative things as I’d like - but overall, I’m doing okay, and I’m getting by. I don’t give a whole lot of attention to my dating profiles (or to dating in general).
  

  
Then, someone from a previous pro bono shoot asks if I’d be willing to help out on his pro bono shoot from July 22nd to July 23rd and from July 28th to July 29th. I say something along the lines of “sure, I can probably help out for a few days” - and of course, I get roped into being a department head.
  

  
I’m going into this shoot with zero expectations - at best, I feel resignation (“I promised to help him out, so I ought to stay on. It’ll probably be fun, but I wish I was getting paid - but then again, they’re mostly college students or recent grads”); at worst, I actively dread it (“fuuuuck why did I agree to this? The gaffer is also gonna be the sound guy, and I’m not gonna have many people to help me as key grip. Do I have enough experience to be able to do my job?”).
  

  
Then I met her.
  

  
While we do go overtime quite frequently, the shoot actually goes remarkably smoothly for me - people laugh at my jokes, my pun game is stellar, and I’m able to do my job pretty well (that, and it’s a film set run by college students, so…). I don’t think much of her at first - she’s cool, she’s cute, and she works as both make-up, costumes, and 2nd AD on the shoot (though she gives the actors quite a lot of direction) - but that’s really about it.
  

  
The second day of the shoot, I interact with her more, and I realize both how pretty and playful and funny she is, and how comfortable I feel teasing her and making fun of her.
  

  
From that point on, I can’t get her out of my mind. When shooting resumes on July 28th, I see her again - but she mentions off-hand that she just broke up with a guy two days ago after he gaslit her and showed up at her job. Fuck, I thought. I have to wait before asking her out. But that’s not the end of the world, I guess.
  

  
During this leg of the shoot, I admit I became a bit more self-conscious, because she also talks to one of the actors a lot - he’s a nice, funny dude who’s also good-looking and manly in a Teddy Roosevelt sort of way - and I admit that I occasionally slip into the “overly-polite nice guy following her like a lost puppy” routine that I performed with other women I’d fallen for instead of teasing her and joking around with her. And it wracks my brain. What if it doesn’t work out with her? It might not work out. The others didn’t. But I also get to spend a lot of time with her, and my attraction deepens - she’s funny, playful, I felt comfortable teasing her and joking around with her (sometimes), she laughed at some of my jokes, she’s outgoing and bubbly, she’s interested in movies and tv, she does stage management (which I can kind of relate to and talk to her about because I do theatre lighting / stagehand gigs when film work is slow), she works as a teacher when she’s not in school and is passionate about helping kids (though recently she told me she wants to transition into film because she feels unappreciated by her students and the company she works for), she’s incredibly intelligent and articulate, she’s driven and ambitious, she does screenwriting, and while she clearly doesn’t take shit from people, she’s also an incredibly, genuinely sweet and friendly person even though she’s had a string of relationships that didn’t work out and experienced at least two or three miscarriages (one when she was concerningly young). How much self-control and willpower does it take to be that kind and sweet after experiencing all that?
  

  
When I think about it now, I realize I haven’t felt this way about anyone else for almost nine years - I’m just kind of in awe of her, and it feels like I respect her and that it’s a selfless kind of attraction. She’s everything I could ever want in a woman. She inspires me to be a better version of myself. She makes me want to finish my video tribute to Lars von Trier, and to pick back up a screenplay idea I’d come up with back in my last semester of college in 2017 (I was too lazy to actually put much effort into writing it, and when I filmed a scene I actually had written, it was too long, and one of my actors hammed up his performance). She even inspires me to want to actually begin writing that screenplay that the aforementioned scenic artist inspired. It feels like a more legitimate love, because this isn’t just a dating profile - this is a real person.
  

  
But she says she wants to move out to LA within a year because she wants to write this miniseries about the miscarriages that women suffer (such as the ones that they don’t even know are miscarriages) and the effects that it can have on them. And it killed me, but it also made me re-evaluate whether or not I wanted to move to LA - I’d undoubtedly get more film set work, I know a lot of people from Emerson who’ve moved out there, my union status could (possibly) be transferrable, and even my mom (who’s not exactly a huge fan of my film career) has repeatedly said I should at least visit LA to see whether or not I like it. Could she be the motivator I need to move there? Is she worth it?
  

  
On the fourth day of shooting (we ended up shooting on the 30th as well), after we’d wrapped for the day, a few of us were smoking together, and I asked them how they came up with screenwriting ideas that they were excited about. She at some point mentioned that she thought that I would have a good grasp of dialogue and that I had a great grasp of social cues, which I was super surprised to hear from anyone - because that REALLY doesn’t sound like me - and I was like “really?”, and most of the people in the group were like “yeah!”, and she started listing off all of these really nice things about me, like how I was witty because I was able to fire off incredibly lame puns all the time, which also meant that I was good at reading the room, and she said that I seemed literary (I think) and educated and smart.
  

  
That night, I talk to the director about my feelings for the girl (I’ve had heart-to-heart convos with him before), and he advised me to at least wait a month before making a move. Not a bad idea.
  

  
The next day, I leave the set early so I can get back to my parents place (I’d been looking after the place while they were on vacation), leave food out for my cats, pick my car up from the shop, transfer my gear back into my own car, drive back home to Somerville, and prep for my upcoming gig, which is helping the electrical crew at a theater in Cambridge strike the set of a major musical that had just wrapped at that venue. Before I go, she invites us to her performance in a tribute to Ruth Gordon that her professor is putting on on Friday, August 4th. She’s not enthusiastic about it, because she’s doing it as a favor, and the haphazard rehearsal schedule forced her to temporarily leave our set early (she came back, though).
  

  
The work I do that week at the theater is absolutely grueling. But at the advising of my close friend / wing-person, I decide to go to her performance, because it’s showing support for her. I even try to invite the director of the shoot so that it’ll be less intimidating for the girl, and so even if the girl can’t do anything afterwards, he and I can at least stay and watch the showings of \*Harold and Maude\* and \*Rosemary’s Baby\* - but the director twisted his ankle the previous night, so he can’t make it.
  

  
I go to the show, and, as expected, it’s excruciating to sit through, self-indulgent, and very thrown-together. After the performance ends, I wait in the audience for a bit so she can get her stuff together, and because I know that the cast and crew members are gonna get swarmed by audience members. Afterwards, I go up to her, hug her as I greet her, and joke around and talk with her as I help her and several of the cast members clear the stage. She mentions that the film set went to shit after I left - the couple who owned the house we were filming at had apparently gotten into a huge fight, and both she and the director had to act as intermediaries. She’s too tired to stick around for either of the movies showing that night, and as we talk, it gets to her personal life, and apparently the aforementioned actor I was worried about had made a move on her - but not only had she just broken up with a guy, but she was also wondering if she was gay. She said she’d been with women before, and had felt more comfortable with them, and had told the actor that she didn’t think they had those vibes. I then said that I’d have asked her out, but that she had just broken up with someone, and that she had shit she needed to figure out. She said she was in a friendzone mindset at the moment, but that she thought there was no reason I couldn’t find someone. I said I’d ask her out sometime in the future. She said she’d be more available to hang out in the coming week, and to hit her up if I was interested in hanging out.
  

  
I felt dead for most of the day on August 5th. I’d promised a girl I’d met through Bumble, but had reconnected with through work, that I’d help her move her studio across the hall, in an effort on my part to keep myself busy and social, and so if nothing happened with the girl from the shoot, I’d at least have some other mildly-social engagement to keep me occupied. I did a lot more heavy lifting than I’d anticipated, and felt so low and borderline catatonic by the end of it. On the ride home, my thoughts turned to purchasing a pack of cigarettes and using them to burn myself.
  

  
(I didn’t buy the pack of cigarettes, and I realized that that really wasn’t a healthy way of thinking, so I’ve been thinking about checking into a psych ward for a few days, but I’m worried about the cost).
  

  
\*\*\*\*\*
  

  
I’m just so exhausted by all of this. Every time I put myself out there for someone I like, either something comes up, they’re not interested, or I screw it up. It just happens time and time and time again, and it’s just so demoralizing and humiliating and soul-crushing, and it makes me feel like less of a person and that something is just fundamentally wrong with me. Even not trying to be romantic with them and just staying platonic never leads to anything more. Why does it work for everyone else, and never for me? Do I still have a chance with her? Will I ever find anyone? Alternatively, can I find enough happiness and contentment that I won’t be overwhelmingly lonely if I stop dating entirely and just accept that I’m going to end up alone? What do I do?
  

  
I just want to find someone who I love, and who mutually loves me back. As masochistic as it might seem, I want her, or someone like her, who makes me feel and want that intensely, because it feels good and selfless to want someone like that who can motivate you to be the best version of yourself that you can be."

"Going to be honest, it was quite hard trying to make it through this post since it was pretty long but I think I get the gist of your thoughts. 

You have to realize who you want may not necessarily be who wants you back. Just like you were particular in who you found attractive, you have to realize that person may not reciprocate your same feelings. Don’t take it personal. The heart is going to want what it wants but you have to also be realistic. If you’re a 5, it’s not favorable to shoot for someone who’s a 9. I don’t know what you look like, but I noticed some people are very picky shooting for the stars and that’s why they are alone.

I think an engaging personality can take you very far. I don’t think your situation is hopeless but I certainly can see certain things you can improve on to make that connection more successful."	Kubrickian1993	reply	na	na	na	0.9897462129592896	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety

What's the best way to work on a school project together with shy/introverted classmates or classmates with social anxiety? Or, in other words, what's the most comforting and least stressful way for you to collaborate with other people? I'm very grateful for any tips or experiences from both sides.	os32910672	post	34.14484074230919	female	White	0.0013447193196043372	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety
"Well, i'd say that the most stressfull part is the presentation, so if you can leave the presentation mostly to the people that don't have social anxiety it would be great.

Other than that i think it's just standard work, you separate the work into parts and see what everyone can do and then you just polish it a little when everyone has done their part.

Some people might have trouble with working on certain subjects but that would be a much more personal thing, so i can't really help you with that."	os32910672	reply	na	na	na	0.0013447193196043372	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"Be kind. Make eye contact but not too intense. If you ask them something, like what they want to work on, and they have trouble answering give them options.
""Would you like to do thing x or y?"" or ""Would you want to work on thing x, would that be okay?""
If other members are unintentionally or intentionally ignoring them, be the one who pays attention and includes them in the group. 
Encouragement and positive attitude is a big one even in groups that don't have anxious people. Good atmosphere makes people more comfortable and efficient.

Just make them feel safe and accepted, it should be fine.

After thought, if you have to work remotely, give them an option to talk in chat or keep their camera off."	os32910672	reply	na	na	na	0.0013447193196043372	no	no	strong	na	socialanxiety
"I went to see Rammstein today , my first ever concert , and I did it completely alone :)

3 years ago I was too afraid  to even take a walk in my neighborhood. I stayed inside all the time and lived like that for 1,5 years. Thought nothing would ever change , that my fate was dying young and alone. I scoffed at anyone that told me things would get better. 

But they did , and yes there's still a long road ahead. But I'm making it, I'm getting there. Bit by bit , personal victory after personal victory. I will be rid of this disorder one day.

Thank you! The only advice I can give you is make sure you plan everything well so you avoid excess stress from things you can easily fix :) The rest is just taking the plunge and going through with it. The most stressful part for me was getting there (I took public transit) but once I was there , it was pretty easy. Remember that you’re pretty much completely anonymous in crowds that big and no one is paying attention to you because everyone is watching the show :)	i_hate_snow_mexicans	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0013475718442350626	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"I am 25 and haven't made new friends irl since middle school. Made a few work acquaintances here or there but never interacted with them outside work except maybe to occasionally buy drugs. Also have a few online friends here or there but they usually stay exclusively online. I still sorta keep in contact with my childhood friends but lost contact with most of them slowly over the years. Only still do things with one of them an I live 1500 miles away from him currently.

I recently moved pretty far and have been struggling with the new environment and new coworkers. Like I barely say hi to them somedays. Today I had to help show a new coworker how the job was done since it was his first day and he also had social anxiety. At the end of the day he thanked me for being nice and said he wanted to be friends and hang out outside of work. I gave up on the possibility of this happening again like 3 or 4 years ago. This is a new experience for me but I am happy. :)"	eaglefalconhawk90	post	32.73947087005536	male	White	0.001313716289587319	na	na	na	9	socialanxiety

It's great that you are starting a friendship with this person. Just remember, and may still feel a little awkward at first. However, you know this person wants to be your friend, so you can ignore the awkwardness and try to push through it.

"I don't have any friends where I live now, besides my family (I'm 26). I have a lot of trouble reaching out to people whenever I leave home. There is a strange fear inside of talking to strangers inside of me.

Most of the time, I prefer staying home, but, according to my therapist, I have to start going out to see people. I decided to go alone to a local skate park to watch a skating competition. I really wanted to meet someone there and perhaps say something, but I feel so afraid. It feels strange to me to approach a random person and start a simple conversation. I though many times of approaching people or a group, but I ended up not talking to anyone the entire event.

In my point of view, it feels strange to approach someone and I fear talking to people. I think that because I don't have friends people won't be interested in talking to me. I fear that because I'm different to them, we'll have trouble conversing.

Has anybody been in a similar situation? How did you overcome your fears?"	Very-Creepy-Month	post	8.87096410697771	male	White	0.9956936836242676	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety
"Going out to see people is really good, but it isn't the ""going out"" that is the main thing, it's the ""people"". It's always better to be together with someone and share a moment in person, but right now i think you need to meet people online first and then invite them out.

I remember going in a anime event with some friends, the whole anime thing didn't interest me much, but they had some retro videogames that i wanted to see so i went in there alone, expecting to meet someone and be able to have a chat or something, but i found myself in a similar situation, i couldn't speak to anybody and the few people i managed to share a word or two just got back to their business and i was alone again.

After a while i got back to my friends group and sticked with them around the anime area and it was definetively better than just sitting alone in the retro videogames area.

I think it would be nice for you to try and join a online group related to skating around your city and try and meet people there. A post like this one should be a nice start and then you can invite people out."	Very-Creepy-Month	reply	na	na	na	0.9956936836242676	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"Hey fellow Redditors,
I hope you're all having a fantastic day! I wanted to reach out to this amazing community because I believe in the power of connection and the potential for friendships to transform lives. Today, I want to extend a warm invitation to all the socially awkward souls out there who are looking to find friends and build meaningful relationships.
We all know that making friends can be challenging, especially for those of us who struggle with social awkwardness. But fear not! I firmly believe that there are kindred spirits out there who understand and appreciate our unique quirks. Together, we can create a supportive and understanding community where we can grow, learn, and have a great time.
Here's my proposal: Let's start a group where we can share our experiences, challenges, and triumphs. We can exchange tips and strategies for navigating social situations, boosting confidence, and overcoming our fears. This group will be a safe space where we can be ourselves without judgment, and where we can encourage and uplift one another.
To kick things off, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the following questions:
What are some of the biggest challenges you face when it comes to social interactions?
Have you discovered any strategies or techniques that have helped you overcome social awkwardness?
What are your interests and hobbies? Let's find common ground and explore new activities together!
Are there any specific goals you have in mind when it comes to making friends and building relationships?
Remember, we're all in this together, and there's strength in numbers. By joining forces, we can support each other on our journey to becoming more confident and socially adept individuals. Let's embrace our uniqueness and turn our social awkwardness into a superpower!
If you're interested in joining this community, please leave a comment or send me a direct message. Together, we can create a space where friendships flourish and social awkwardness becomes a thing of the past.
Looking forward to connecting with all of you!

"Hey so I'm gonna be the first one to answer. I'm M 24

I've been socially anxious probably since i was around 8 or so. And i had to deal with a good amount of awkwardness and bullying because of that which in itself was pretty challenging in itself. However in my teen years i became pretty good at masking the anxiety ( you know kinda creating an artificial persona i think makes me feel less weird and therefore less anxious), my biggest challenge since then i think is letting go of that mask. All of the friends I made in the past felt just fake because they only knew my mask and not actually me, and I still am unable to show myself to anyone other than my gf. 
At times i really fear never being able to show my actual self in public. Does anyone feel any similarly? 

(Sry i kinda just needed to vent)

What has helped me make talking less awkward is asking a lot of follow up questions. A lot of people like talking about themselves and i prefer that rather than talking myself so it's a win win.
 The downside is I sometimes spend more time thinking about the next question than actually listening to the person which makes me feel a bit of an hypocrite, but it's a decent exercise for small talk."	Calmcentered1	reply	na	na	na	0.0011525647714734077	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"tl;dr: I am in a good place in life in general and find myself rather attractive as a person, and I am aware of the common advice of not being shy and afraid of rejection/embarrassment, but I just hit the wall whenever I try to push myself to initiate contact. I feel stuck and tired of trying to ""just do it"". What do I do?

I have been lucky to find great friends and a partner by 27yo through multiyear joint experiences, so I never ""practiced"" deliberately making connections. But then 2 years ago I moved to another country and de facto lost all close connections I had, and I am struggling to build new because of social awkwardness and anxiety.

2 cases in point: yday I went to a boxing gym, and there was a guy from a country close to my homeland, we started talking at his initiative, and I thought: he seems cool, we could be friends, maybe we should grab a beer or smth. But then when we were leaving the the gym and were supposed either to say goodbye or propose to do smth I just said ""nice to meet you, take care"". Then I went to a club alone to enjoy some music and maybe find a one night stand, and it went the same way it's been since I started trying this. There was a girl with whom we rubbed shoulders and she was looking at me every several minutes, touching her hair etc. And I thought: ok man even if you fail, it's already a progress cause it's a learning experience, so just fucking say hi. And then I found multiple excuses to delay the action for an hour or so until she left. And same goes for relationships at the firm I work for. 

For context, I am look good, I make ok money, people who got close with me say I am a good person/friend/lover/partner etc. I also know that until 4yr old I was very outgoing, eager to talk to random people, laughed a lot and (almost?) never cried. But then I had quite a dark childhood, which turned me into a closed and grim person. I worked on it myself and with a therapist, got optimistic and enthusiastic about my life in general, but connecting to people is still a struggle unless circumstances sort of push us into each other so we eventually bond after months of joint work etc.

I am at the point when the immediate goal is not even to build a connection but at least to fucking try. I really don't care whether I get rejected or embarrassed, I  kind of anticipate it as a fun part of learning. I also tried substances that are supposed to calm down anxiety and awkwardness, enhance feeling of connectedness. I've been pushing myself deliberately for the past 2 months, and made no progress. It feels like some muscle is just numb and I cannot make the move, although I feel like I know how do it."

You need to find people that like the same topics or hobbies as you and start by sharing the little specific things you like about those. People really like to talk about how they FEEL or FELT about things and you can share how you feel about little specific things about your favorite movie, book, hobby or even just your favorite meal.

If those people end up liking the same things or just like the way you speak about those things, they'll talk to you more often and then you can create a nice friendship maybe."	Slow-Application-767	reply	na	na	na	0.9982625842094421	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"Around 3 months ago I started jogging. I go every other day. I partly started thinking it would help my anxiety whilst also keeping fit and giving me something to do. The problem is, it has done absolutely nothing for my anxiety, I can go out and jog just fine, but I'm anxious the entire time. I still feel weird around people. I don't know where to look and I feel really self conscious as I get out of breath and start panting. It's difficult to enjoy when I can't stop thinking everyone thinks I'm a weirdo. It's not like it's unusual to see people jogging around here. 

I obviously expected some discomfort when I first started, but I feel like now that the actual activity of jogging has become easier and lost its ""novelty"", it distracts me from the anxiety less and less.

I don’t think I have any good advice or anything but I can relate with you, i exercise in my home alone. i just run/jog on a treadmill we have at home since I am way to nervous to jog or anything in my own neighborhood. if you want to exercise but dont want to be around people then you can always get a treadmill or just find a place where you can go on a jog alone where not many people are around.

"Try combining it with self affirming meditation afterwards. Think and feel positive emotions after a workout. This is what actually helps with self esteem. I think the core issue with social anxiety is how we see ourselves instead of how others see us. Frankly, when negative thoughts arise don't push them away but don't give into them either. Our thoughts don't define us and are highly dependent on mood and circumstances and just because you feel weird or not worth, doesn't mean that you actually are. You probably have some quality talents mentally, physically, idk focus on those on your strengths and start feeling good about yourself. You are more than good enough and you do not need an amount x of friends or be in y social gatherings per week to be an honorable person. Make life about you. Because you matter. Your happiness matters. You can do so much in life and being social is one component, one of many.

You dont have to be strict with protein and diet all the time, a lot of the online recommendations are overkill until you've been lifting for a couple years or you're trying to get strong/huge fast or something . As long as you eat a little extra food including extra protein you'll be good, and do a little of each muscle group every week.

"At my old job I was incredibly quiet and always kept my head down, never spoke unless prompted, never made eye contact and was just generally ignored. I started at a new job today with a much friendlier environment so I tried my best to open up and speak to my co-workers to start off on a positive note. 

To be honest, they probably think I’m extremely strange. A lot of my attempts at conversation were awkward and they could probably tell I wasn’t used to speaking but I felt very proud that I tried regardless. 

I did my best mimic the behavior of an extroverted co-worker and called a few people by name and even said good-bye when I could. 
Hopefully once I find my place within the store I’ll be able to relax more.

"I need to rant…. i’m (21F) literally going through memories from 6+ years ago and i don’t know why it took me this long to come to this realization… but no, not everyone is out to get me. i was genuinely a shitty person and was incapable of picking up social cues.
this is about to sound like the worst thing ever but i apparently thought so highly of myself that i didn’t want to become friends with certain people because of how they were seen by others. the “outcasts” “nerds”, or even “normal” people in middle and high school gave me every opportunity to be friends with them. they’d invite me to their table, straight up ask to “be friends” and i awkwardly declined or just didn’t pursue the conversation because i didn’t want to be labeled a loser even though THAT is exactly what made me a loser. I had 1 friend from middle school who used to live in my neighborhood and we became even closer when she and her other friend came to the pool at the rec center and we hung out together. they asked me that i should ask to switch my period at lunch so i can sit with them. i never took them up on that offer because i was just too awkward but this would have been THE perfect opportunity for me to become close friends. the lunch period i was in during that time, i had a girl who was always nice to me but i always ended up sitting alone because when recess time came, i preferred to be inside and just read… idk how i lacked social cues this bad but this was such a big mistake.. i think about this and just hate myself so much. i was only in middle school but i should’ve known better.  Even now, there are people that i have known from childhood that used to invite me and my sister out all the time to hang out but i never wanted to go because it was always so awkward since i could not hold a conversation and they’re were already much closer to each other than i was with them. My sister didn’t want to go without me so we just always declined.. they don’t invite us anymore and i have the audacity to act shocked. they asked us like 3+ times and we always said no. i hate myself for this. In college, i was SO close to making a friend, she was in one of my classes and went at the same bus stop as me so i actually had the courage to start a convo and she was so sweet. she even offeredto walk together after class to the bus stop but i awkwardly stopped the convo and i made it so awkward for both of us. i lack social skills so bad but i feel like if i was just slightly better,  i could actually have friends. i don’t know what to do. i keep embarrassing myself. it makes me feel like shit when i see people hanging out with their friends. it comes so naturally to them"	LifeguardDry1277	post	12.597791369759436	male	White	0.9973357319831848	na	na	na	3	socialanxiety
"PLEASE don't be hard on yourself. No, you couldn't know better, you did what you could at the moment. 
Now it's another context for you, you're learning to do better, and you WILL keep on making mistakes.

 I think an important skill is to learn to forgive yourself for making those mistakes instead of hating yourself for them (easier said than done, i myself am still struggling).

 I have made almost literally the same mistakes as you, and a lot of other people have too, we're human that's what we do, no reason to hate ourselves for that. Instead you should be proud for seeing those mistakes even if your behaviour doesn't change that much and EVEN IF YOU MAKE THE EXACT SAME MISTAKES.

Omg same, also 21 and I have struggled a lot with how I perceived myself in high school and middle school. I also thought so highly of myself and left my three really good friends and safety for the popular girls that I had nothing in common with. and like you said, even the “normal” people (not really popular but not outcasts) wasn’t good enough(???) like how could I think like that? I wasn’t a popular type of girl but definitely not an outcast either, but being that with my normal and good friends was suddenly not enough, I had to strive and change myself to be in the popular gang, and how did it go? I became a MUCH bigger looser and an outcast, I lost my sense of self completely, lost my friends, I even forgot how to behave normally, I accepted being left out by them and ended up lonely. I still can’t get over this, I still have no idea who I am, I developed extreme social anxiety afterwards and so on. I hate who I was and feel like I still have to pretend to behave in a different way so I’m not perceived as the looser I am (or was).

practice your FACE off!!!!! Write down what you want to say about each slide (if you mean a PowerPoint). I have been singing since 2nd grade and it took me until senior year in High School to realize that looking at the audience while singing totally made my nervousness disappear. It was the weirdest thing. As bad as my social anxiety is, looking at the audience calms me every time! So another tip for you, try analyzing the audience for a few seconds before you start. Many professional public speakers give the advice of moving eye contact to three different people around the room during your speech/presentation. This way you’re not shifting your eyes between every single person making you more nervous. Good luck!	Realistic_Lie_	reply	na	na	na	0.9930872321128845	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

I don’t have a lot to say during family functions , either because my anxiety makes me feel like what I will say will come out wrong/not clear enough or I honestly don’t know what to talk about.

I just sit there silently with awkward smile. I feel the same as you. When I try to get involved in the conversations but there is literally no thoughts in my head.

"it makes social moments so challenging and awkward for me. I have looked up so many videos on yt about conversation, tone, approach etc. but i just can’t figure it out. I hate conversations. I don’t have anything to talk about. Whenever i think i made a friend, once they get to see that i’m just a blank slate, they leave. I feel like i have no personality. I start gasping for breath mid sentence and lose my train of thought. I don’t know how to relate to people and i hate being perceived. Being a human in a world full of humans is so scary. What can i do to fix these fears, or what steps can i take to be less anxious when being around people?

I've accepted it's just not happening.  Not only is my anxiety such a barrier to get to know anyone, but it just seems like nobody cares anymore.  Especially as an adult.  Most people just go to work and sleep, and never want to meet anyone new.  Even when they talk to me, they're just doing it out of politeness.  And if they do want to meet people, it sure isn't me.  I just can't be bothered anymore.  But it leaves me with a lot of spare time in my schedule to do things.  How do you find fulfillment and happiness when it's not with other people.	jamesthedean1	post	16.864992670830286	male	White	0.9989433884620667	na	na	na	19	socialanxiety

"As someone with social anxiety (i stutter so starting a conversation is a huge problem, more so when you're a man and expected to start the conversation), all I can say is it does get better. You'll always find people who are your vibe. 

Don't do anything out of the ordinary. Keep doing what you like, you'll find people who are lot like you than you think before you know it.

And if you truly don't find anyone, my tip (worked for me, can't say the same for anyone else obv) would be to get out of your comfort zone. Take a trip, go eat somewhere new.

"It really sounds like you don't want to be alone, but just have given up hope. In that case, it will hardly be possible to enjoy yourself with things you label as something to ""pass the time"".  
  
In my case, all my interests basically don't require direct contact with anyone, so it's rather easy. Currently trying out getting up at 5AM so that I can do something productive until breakfast (atm learning a language), videogames eat A LOT of time as an avid fan of RPGs, sometimes I go for a walk while listening to a language learning podcast (could just as well be music), working out 3x per week, playing guitar, reading books, browsing reddit obviously...I actually wish I had more time so that I could follow more hobbies and give the ones I already have the time they deserve.  
  
In your situation, this will probably all not be worth much as there seems to be a craving for social interaction. Do you have any sort of nerdy hobby by any chance?

I really want to like this because i've experienced what you said.  There were people I thought I got along with, they were extroverted and the conversation flowed well, but they got sick of me after a few days or a few weeks if it even lasted that long.  What I noticed was that they only liked me in the beginning, but when they noticed my personality, they would leave me for another extroverted person.  There was never a time in my life, except for college, where someone would genuinely want to be my friend over a period of one month or longer.  And college was probably a fluke since they were just forced to be in the same class as me.  If there was really people for me then why would everyone I meet get tired of me after awhile? It seems like i'm not good enough for people.  And it's not like i've barely put myself out there in the past.  If I took a count i've easily interacted with 500+ people in the last few years, more than ever, and it led to nothing.  I'm so exhausted, but I do get your point about going to new places.

I don't really worry too much, telling myself I'm going to do a good job, and I try to do the best I can. It sounds cliche, but it works.

It actually does a huge job with the mental symptoms because you don't get excited physically and therefore your body remains calm so whatever mental issues are not made worse.  Social anxiety is both a physical and mental feedback loop situation.  Beta Blockers cut off the physical aspect which calms things considerably regarding mental symptoms.	happyday1995	reply	na	na	na	0.9983354210853577	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"Well, with the supplement I have for it, I take roughly 1 tbsp of the powder stirred with water. The effects on me have lasted at least for the rest of the day(I take it in the morning). As for the alcohol question, from what I can find about that interaction, it probably isn’t safe.  Also, I may be a special case for this working because I may have a dopamine deficiency. I could be wrong, however, as L-dopa has been taken as a mood supplement a lot in the past. Either way, you never know with supplements, so I’d say it’s worth trying at the very least. This is technically only meant to be taken by Parkinson’s disease patients however it is purchasable by anyone online in the US at least and is marketed as a supplement. 

I’d recommend going on r/nootropics and reading up on Mucuna pruriens through past posts of non Parkinson’s people using it. It’s seems kinda obscure but there have been reports of some reporting positive side effects from it."	happyday1995	reply	na	na	na	0.9983354210853577	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"Oh, I wasn’t actually aware of that. I have two bottles of this stuff because my father with Parkinson’s didn’t want it and told me I should try it. It’s just a powdered version of Mucuna pruriens, I’m pretty sure, and all the supplements for it have the same amount of natural L-DOPA from what I’ve seen., which is the main ingredient that makes it so helpful. From what I can tell from browsing online, it may be difficult to get Zandopa specifically, but there are plenty of alternatives that will work just as well. 

I personally want to just say to anyone else who is interested in this to make sure to limit the usage, because I’ve seen many horror stories of DAWS (dopamine agonist withdrawal) but that’s only if you take it a lot."	happyday1995	reply	na	na	na	0.9983354210853577	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

I’m a college student who recently finished freshman year, and am currently on summer break. I actually did a decent job making friends last year - but that’s because they would hang out at the common area right outside my suite (3 of them lived in the suite right across the hall from mine). It was very low risk; I could just go outside my suite, they’d be hanging out and say hi to me, and I could join them in whatever activities they were doing. It was the most I’ve ever hung out with people in my life. But next year, they’re all getting a suite together (this doesn’t mean anything; they’re all guys and I’m a girl so I obviously couldn’t do a suite with them anyway), and I’ll be living a 1-2 minute walk away. They’ll probably all hang out in their own suite’s common area, and they said I could visit and hang out whenever I wanted, but knowing me I won’t visit them unless they invite me. And part of me feels like they won’t invite me anyway. So yeah, guess those friends are gone then :(	Novelle_1020	post	23.398254572352304	female	White	0.9963464140892029	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety
"Maybe then don't visit them, but go around the place they are at and then they may invite you over.

I'd say that trying to stick with them would be much better though, i think you should contact the one you feel the most comfortable with and ask if you can hang out or something. Maybe the distance you'll be making will make them feel awkward to invite you, so at least talk to them and open the opportunity for them to invite you."

"I (22, f) am diagnosed with social anxiety and OCD.
However, I think my social anxiety manifests a bit differently and I just want to see, if some of you can relate and if so, what you do/did to help with it.

So my SA started in childhood mostly due to bullying and then got even worse through more negative experiences.
My symptoms are less concerned on meeting new people, but more on meeting people and potentially forming a relationship toward them. I get weirdly cramped, cannot let loose or actually enjoy myself beyond just being nice. The tension usually climaxes in me feeling physically in danger around them and me either fleeing or shutting down and dissociating. This also happens with close friends of mine whom I have known for a decade.

I am in therapy, but we are currently focusing on my OCD so I guess I will talk through all of this with my therapist eventually, but maybe you can relate and give some insight."	Spare_Car6520	post	36.39104025914075	female	White	0.9978243112564087	na	na	na	4	socialanxiety

"25M s/w eng guy here, bookish, brought up by overprotective, but loving and caring parents, I've never got the urge to voluntarily socialize, since childhood. I can't remember much about people (like names, living, family details etc) or get concerned about their well-being, until unless I get very close. But when people approach me by themselves, (usually for favour or help) I start talking to people.

I never watch or play or even concerned (totally disinterested) about any sport. The bare minimum I've even done, with few neighbour friends during childhood is, playing hide&seek/running kind of stuff.

I don't have any interest to even try out any new food recipe. Since I'd got repeated health disturbances during childhood, my parents were caring, concerned & restrictive with food choices. I happily accepted it too. Being vegetarian and not trying unhealthy risky food, add to it. I just marry with my own food choices (mostly healthy ones only) and stick to them for life. I rarely get cravings. So it's difficult to even talk about food for long, with people. For instance, people laugh if I say junk food is unhealthy.

Since childhood and till now, I'd only thought what's the purpose of even living. Have I been in depression since childhood? I have had no childhood trauma in life (just born a month preterm). Being only child , I've lovely parents, but relatives and family members were distant and not much touch. I had and have the capability to just keep staring at the four walls of the room. I haven't been much of a trouble maker at all at home, during childhood. I've never got beat by parents anyday, coz I haven't been mischievous mostly. I've been judged sensitive, timid, physically weak, soft (but true to some extent though). I'd learned some bike riding & driving, but hate driving due to anxiety. I don't think I have the niche to drive, due to my overthinking and distracting mind. I find it uncomfortable when people constantly ask if you know riding/driving or when people brag about their driving skills.

I haven't gone out much with friends (very few occasions and only within local). Lot of happy family trips (mostly pilgrimage) have been with my parents.

I don't enjoy stuff most people enjoy, so it's difficult to strike conversations. People enjoy bragging their unworthy risk-taking skills, to fulfill their egos. I get anxious when people always brag.

I talk funny and make others laugh (with memes and funnily relating stuff to local movies), but inside I know I'm a serious person (a career person), which most of them find boring. So I'm left with negligible topics to talk about. I can't keep a conversation for hours about anything, like other people. I like to talk in depth about specific stuff, not generic stuff, but no one has the patience to keep up such deep convos. I think like 40+ adults. I'm glad I'm responsible by nature, but concerned because I'm boring to others.

I have negligible people (in my age group), in my life left, due to no siblings, no cousins concerned about me nor in touch. People judge and don't treat well (take you for granted), if you have less or no people of your own, in life. Given that I can't go back and change my life now, how can I accept this life and be happy without getting judged by others?"	futile_but_alive	post	24.149100519648027	female	White	0.9945264458656311	na	na	na	44	socialanxiety

A character trait holding me back is that I fear failure and hence don't try, which inevitably leads to lacking skill to improve chances of success.

try another angle!  that voice in your head is so critical.  sounds like you are easily entertained with your interests and thoughts and if you would stop your internal dialogue and just watch the world around you, engage in it, explore new hobbies, try new things, you may find your ppl.  i took up yoga and then karate late in life and love it.  watching wildlife too! i actually chose my friends very carefully because my alone free time is so valuable to me.  be grateful you’re an introvert, so many ppl are so ill at ease when they’re alone!  reach out to ppl, be just really friendly everywhere and try to bring some sunshine to everyone you meet.  laugh and make jokes and know that eventually, your peers will grow up and you’ll settle in nicely with all the 40 year olds.  my husband went to law scho with someone who was maturity level 40, but he was really in his 20s.  he was quirky and awkward but now he’s really cool and has grown into himself.  maybe that’s you.  don’t give up.  find pleasure in new things.  and remember if you ever think about giving up on life, there’s plenty of time to be dead so why not enjoy something while you’re here!  it’s an amazing place and life is incredible!	futile_but_alive	reply	na	na	na	0.9945264458656311	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"Perhaps you play life too safe. When is the last time you did anything that made you feel uncomfortable or nervous? Your comfort zone might have shrunk to a small area, and since you've been fine staying in it so far, it hasn't grown. But now it seems it's starting to bother you.

As for depth of conversations, I think people are actually open to it, but not as a conversation starter. Small talk has the purpose of feeling each other out - is this a person I can trust with my thoughts? Are we on the same wavelength? Is this person interested in me or only themselves? Etc. *Some* interest in other people (even if faked) is crucial for good communication. I think you expect too much of people. Not everyone is interested in the same things as you - that doesn't mean you can't make a relationship with them, it's just not gonna be the relationship talking deep topics you imagined. There are persons for that too, but they are a little farther in between, and you only bump into them while socializing with other people.

I think you think too much about what sets you apart from other people. Try to think a little less of yourself, and focus on other people and getting out to try new things. Curiosity will come if you are open minded. For example, I don't have ANY interest in sport either. But my lab partner enjoyed bouldering, so I patiently listened to him talk about it and tried to learn more about it, because I could see it made him happy. It's not faking interest, it's just being open minded and listening. Of course it shouldn't *only* be about making the other person happy, but it's a necessary part to listen to people. If you show no interest, why should they show interest in you? It's an exchange.

"I am a coach and have quite a few clients just like you.  First, I would like to thank you for sharing your story and giving us the opportunity to share in your experience. 

Here are some things that have been very successful to my clients.  They don't work overnight as it takes time to shift a lifetime of behaviors, thinking and mindset, but the way we all move towards our desires is to start to take action; no matter how small the steps are.  Encouragement is what I hope you receive from this comment.

Would you consider shifting your thinking in a very intentional manner?  Your language and thoughts are disempowering and I know that there are people out there who love to engage in deep conversation.  You just haven't met them yet.

What if you were to start to embrace who you are.  Start spending time in daily affirmations about your strengths.  If you consider yourself an outlier, trust me when I say there are many people who would consider themselves outliers.

Work at not having expectations of the outcomes you will have with people.  Just allow yourself to embrace the experience.

There are many tools for starting to shift your thinking.  Youtube, psychology website or even here on Reddit will provide some methods of transforming thoughts.

Also consider taking new actions.  You must change experiences if you want something different.  If you want deep conversations, consider joining a mensa group, toastmasters or a philosophical group or organization.  These people will probably be more aligned with who your are. Find your people.  They are out there.

I do not want you to think that I am suggesting that, poof, you will have what you want in a flash and will shift your thoughts that you have spent a lifetime building and reinforcing overnight..

In social settings like family gatherings, my talking is directly proportional to the number of people I knew.  Sometimes I talk well, sometimes I don't (depends on how well my life is going on during that time). Even my Mom often complains I'm not social, not physically helping others during functions, when I don't know what help I could offer and feel embarrassing when I have to ask people what I can do.

"""As for depth of conversations, I think people are actually open to it, but not as a conversation starter""

  I agree. But, I observed people usually like to talk deeply only if the topics are movies/politics/sports and people skip topic to topic if the topic of discussion is other than these three. I get exhausted by just listening*. 

""I think you think too much about what sets you apart from other people""

  That's absolutely right about me. But I think this way because even my family members, S. O. and her family are way more different than I am and I worry how I'll be accommodating/accompanying. Maybe I'll have to take life a little easier or accept myself and live in my own way.

""Instead of saying junk food is unhealthy (which kinda judges them and makes them feel bad about themselves)""

  I don't outright deject others with judgements like ""junk food is unhealthy"". If asked, I just say food xxx doesn't always do good to 'my' body and so I play safe at times with food (I like and I do have junk food once in a while). But, people criticize like why I am so critical about food and they start bragging like no food can upset their stomach. 
People start judging (to the extent of even questioning your choices and interests) only when they feel you are different and you can't be in their league. 
Maybe I shouldn't have been more straightforward or as you say, I should learn to suggest alternatives like ""you like xx, but I like yy"".

Relatable, but I've had this probably during my childhood. I didn't have the reflex to talk, unless others talk to me first. But I'm marginally better today as an adult, but still I can't be as light-minded as others in terms of groups, social settings and activities, since childhood determines how you are as an adult.	futile_but_alive	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9945264458656311	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

"I feel very similarly. I envy those who are interested in many things, and actually take an approach to understand them, to master them, and to develope a passion towards them. 

I feel like I have never been able to master anything despite having interests in them, like sports, musical instruments, other hobbies. I think I learn new skills much slower than others. But I do feel good when I see improvements in myself. So what I have started doing recently is, picking up the hobbies I left behind years ago and trying to master them, at least reaching a level higher than before. Because I believe when I think I am good at something, I will gradually develop passion in it.

However, in career, the lack of passion really puts me behind people in the same age. Yes I was able to go through college and got considerably good grades when I tried, but I never had a passion about it unlike others in my class. I only picked the major because I was good at math in high-school (turned out i haven't been good at math since advanced calculus). So unlike those who know what they want to achieve in their career, me, who lacks passion, is socially awkward, lacks social skills, is kind of lost as well.

I started reading different books recently, although they haven't helped me gain passion in my career, I have become more aware of what's going on inside my mind. I hope by understanding myself more, I can become more open minded about the fact that we can grow, and it is never too late to grow. I recommend reading (if you haven't) ""Counselling for Toads"", I think people who tend to self-reproach or are just confused in general will feel understood while reading the main character's experience and conversations.

  People are interested in multiple things, but most of them don't develop a passion for everything, just casual hobbies/entertainment to blend with others and they do this ""blending"" effortlessly, without any thinking. Coz most are lucky to get the general skills effortlessly, but it takes time for us to ""blend"" in and unable to catch up later. I'm confident with my career, just that I'm socially clumsy.

"Half of the time, it doesn't bother me that I don't have friends. I enjoy doing things on my own. I treat myself. I laugh at my own jokes. I appreciate the silence. Sometimes I am hard on myself, but I try not to be. During the pandemic I was ecstatic about getting to stay home all the time. A good time to me sounds like me, my cats, either a book, a video game, or a TV show, and a beverage. A beer, a hot chocolate, tea, or a smoothie. Doesn't matter what it is.

The other half of the time, I look around at everyone who has friends and wish I could have friends too. But I wonder if that's an actual desire or more of a desire to be like everyone else. I only wish I could have friends when it's time for an event where friends are needed. Like when I got married (eloped to avoid the awkward fact that I would have no bridesmaids or a maid of honor), or eventually when my mother in law wants a baby shower (I'm absolutely dreading that). Like a ""Everyone around me has a zillion friends. I should too. What is wrong with me?""

But then whenever there is an opportunity to be social, I get grumpy. I know the source of that is social anxiety and not feeling comfortable in my own skin around others. But it's also that it's tiring and I hate people. I feel like I was born with an old man's soul who yells at people to get off his lawn. I know that I should be social, especially if I want to make a connection. But I never want to be social. I get to an event and I can't wait to leave. If there is an after-party, I sure won't be at it. 

There has to be some kind of selfishness to this. In order to get friends, that means you have to take an interest in other people's lives. I never seem to take a genuine interest in others. Or maybe it's because everyone I meet never seems to take a genuine interest in me. Like one giant feedback loop. There has been times where I felt like I could vibe with somebody and I tried to take interest. Asked them about their personal lives, talked about shared interests. It never goes beyond surface level. Usually, they already have friends. They don't need another.

There has been so many studies that say humans are social creatures and they aren't meant to be alone. And I'm sure there is truth to that. It's not like I'm 100% alone. I have my husband. I'm posting on this subreddit trying to connect with other people right now.  But that aside, I still feel content. At least, half of the time."

I know I progressed because I was scared of working, a got a job and I am trying to find a balance of taking care of myself and the anxiety the job brings me, I couldn't exercise in public or go to the swimming pool, I now do it frequently, I couldn't sit and read a book while having coffee by myself, I can now also do it. But trying new activities to meet new people, I still can't. At least not alone. And I am really frustrated to be like this. But this is incredibly scary to me. Any tips ? Any activities that might not be too hard to try at first ? What is even worse is that I reached a point where I could do a lot easily two years ago and now I have to start all of this again after a period without working...

"Social Anxiety is pretty much a Phobia, so you can't just ""get over it"", you gotta slowly work towards minimizing it's impacts on your life, just like those things you said you got better at with time.

If you didn't have much success doing things alone, then i'd recommend you ask your friend to go with you again and try to take one step forward each time, so that you are slowly getting used to doing uncomfortable things until they feel much more natural to do.

One of the things i think that would make meeting new people easier would be just being there. If people see you enough times they might feel a little bit more comfortable to strike a conversation."	trowayformydignity	reply	na	na	na	0.9994271993637085	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

Not because I hate my family, or I don’t want anyone in my house, but because I can’t handle it.

"I was driving yesterday and I passed a side walk that had what looked like 5 teen boys walking but as soon as I passed, they all (no joke) stopped walking and looked to just stare at me, even when I passed them by 100+ feet. It freaked me out but I decided to turn around and ask them if they needed something, so I turned around and as I pulled up, they looked surprised and then nervously said that my right side tire looked wobbly. I didn’t exactly believe that but I reluctantly said thank you and pulled over somewhere close to actually check. Well, I was right—my tire wasn’t wobbly, there was nothing wrong with my car and they lied to me.

I’m so sick of being stared at by everyone like they all secretly know something about me that I don’t. Why does this keep happening to me? It’s making me feel crazy.

Edit: to those of you assuming that I’m a narcissist or trying to make the world all about me, please refrain from commenting on my post. I am traumatized.

"I don’t mean to diminish your experience but I think it’s possible this is a little bit of paranoia fueled by anxiety.

I’ve felt like people are staring at me too but often the fact is that people just stare *in general.* If you’re in a car passing a pedestrian, esp. if you’re going rather slow, they’re gonna be looking at you. And if you’re a pedestrian on a slow street, drivers are gonna take a look at you too. People are just bored sometimes, and when there’s the barrier of a car between you and them I think it emboldens people to be a little more brazen.

Not to mention, have you considered that you are staring at them too? Again, I don’t think it’s unnatural to find yourself staring at someone, and *especially* if you’re anxious and curious about them looking at you, you may end up taking a lot of glances, which in turn makes them more preoccupied with you, and so on."

"I get people staring at me also. Some will keep staring when I catch them staring at me. I understand from this behaviour that they are rude, aggressive and it would be wise to not be confrontational. The others stare at me while I’m not noticing them and as soon as I catch them staring they shift their eyes away immediately. Those who stare are nosy people. I’m not talking about glances but rude staring. It speaks volumes about them and their bad attitudes in general. I noticed that you said they lied afterwards. Well that’s expected from someone rudely staring at you , a bad trait “the lying”. That’s why it’s best to avoid them because they might have other bad traits that comes up after the rude staring, and lying. 

I have came to the conclusion that these people have nothing going on in their lives that is why they are staring at random people around them. It’s better to ignore the stares anyway and have nothing to do with them. I guess they are troublesome and a headache to be around them honestly as its disrespectful to stare at people. The rude stare is just an indication that they are trouble. You might be annoyed from the stare but view it as an indicator of toxicity and bad behavior.
Also I noticed the number of people who stare could be counted with your fingers which is a very low number. It is best to ignore altogether the anxiety that comes from the staring and maybe tell yourself maybe they are daydreaming. Or maybe you are just being within their eye view. Or maybe they know someone who looks like you. Don’t give it too much thought. You don’t need to know why someone is staring at you. If you get alot of stares maybe have a friend be with you or move around with a group of friends. Teens have a tendency to be toxic when in groups. They are immature and could be just making unaware immature behaviors. Making fun of random strangers and other silly childish teenage stuff.

"So an old friend wants me to come to her graduation day but I don't wanna go.

So I was in college together with her in 2020 but dropped out and moved to another institution after only a month. She was the only friend that helped me a lot when I was in college with her. She was the only one that sent me a birthday gift back then. She also knows I dropped out because of my social anxiety and that I was suicidal too. So she's someone that means a lot to me and she knows about my SA. I haven't seen her since 2020 but we still keep in touch sometimes.

Today she texted me demanding me to come to her graduation day next week. She said it in an angry way. As if, if I don't come she'll be mad at me. Which sucks cause I want to come, but now that I think about it, I won't just be seeing her. I'll be seeing my other old classmastes too. I've also gained weight since the last time they saw me in 2020. It's too much for me. I'll be a nervous wreck. I hate that she's pressuring me to come. I don't wanna lose her if I don't come.

Just venting, mostly.  I needed an accommodation for a program I’m going to this summer, and I had to defend myself and my need for the accommodation to the director because he tried to talk me out of it.  He essentially said that everyone says they have social anxiety and he thought I would change my mind about the accommodation if he explained why he doesn’t like to do it (which has nothing to do with anything except his idea of how people should interact).  He was rude in his response and now I’m panicking about him being mad at me and making my life hell there since he’s head honcho.  It’s not fair that to get the accommodation I need for a condition, it sends that same condition into a flare.  I felt really brave in my initial reply because I stood up for myself and my community and then he knocked it all down and said he was “well aware” of everything I said about disability rights which is obviously not true if he’s trying to talk people out of accommodations and assuming he knows and gets to decide whose condition is “valid” or not.	dontfearthewitch	post	18.8422423943686	female	White	0.9994609951972961	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety

How people will exclude me in every new work space, how every interaction I have with people turns awkward because of my incompetence and how every little negative instance I’ve experienced due to my severe socially anxiety haunts me constantly I feel so selfish for always thinking about myself but I can’t control my thoughts I’m literally a prisoner to my own mind I’m so weak minded and I’ll have periods of time where I can lie to myself that I’m not a complete social reject and I don’t deserve to feel ashamed all the time but then in one night I’ll realize my reality again and start hating myself and my life. because the reality is my social anxiety will never go away. No medication or exposer therapy has ever worked for me. It’s just the way my brain functions in this reality. It’s who I am. So I don’t see the point in lying to myself.

You are totally correct here and it’s amazing your trying to change it! Self-pity is a disease and it will destroy you if you let it control you. I recommend finding like-minded people with similar experiences, so you, hopefully, realize you are not alone nor is your experience special. I had to learn this the hard way because I had become such an entitled asshole at one point and thought the world owed me something for how my life has been but nobody owes you or me anything. It is up to us to make this change.	demurepaella	reply	na	na	na	0.9983440637588501	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"Not sure this is the best place to talk about this but I don’t have therapy for some time, and I don’t have anyone to talk to about it. (I’m a 21F btw)

I work a job making cookies and today I was doing the station where you are supposed to prepare the cookies and give them to the customers. Well we’ve been super busy and understaffed for weeks and it’s been awful. One day this week I worked a 12 hour shift, cause if I left, it would have been only one person in the store and I felt so bad cause we were so busy. Anyways so I was doing the orders for the customers and I was getting really behind and one of my coworker Riley came to help me.

 There was some miscommunication and we kept screwing up this one person’s order. The customers were laughing at us basically/being mad, and all the other customers were staring at me when I’d have to go up and give orders to people and when it was wrong it was so awkward. I have some social anxiety and just like anxiety in general and this was terrible, I just felt like I had to run away, I felt like I was actually going insane. For a second I stopped helping customers and just topped a bunch of the other cookies and let Riley do the customer service bit because I was freaking out. 

Riley, I’m not sure if she is joking when she says things or being serious but she is rude sometimes. And when I was doing orders with her she kept like yelling at me for doing everything. I have seniority over her in age and amount of time I’ve worked their and knowledge in the workplace. She was going so slow that the orders were piling up even more and when our manager came over and ask what the hold up was. I just kinda said “if it’s easier I can do something else if I’m just in the way…” and like then when they were both distracted doing the orders. I went to the back to one of my friends Patricia, and I told her just “I feel like I’m in the way.” And she was empathetic, and I couldn’t hold back my tears, and I just burst out crying. And than i went in the bathroom and and thought what is my life anyways? And than I lost my name tag in the bathroom cause it fell off my hat and burnt myself on the arm with a hot pan when I was on ovens. And we didn’t get out of there until almost 2:00 am :(((((

Everyday I go into work and I hope it will be chill but it’s stressful cause of how understaffed we are and I don’t know what to do. We run out of cookies and I have to awkwardly try to help people and they are just angry and frustrated when we are out and it’s terrible for anxiety/ social anxiety. I don’t want to get a different job but everyday in these moments I feel like I’m going to break down or like I have to run away. It feels awful I don’t know."

if they're understaffed, that's the responsibility of the manager not you, it's not fair that you are putting your whole self and more into this work when it's not like you even own the company. this sounds like very very stressful work and if you carry on like this you will burn out.. not only that but if they kmow you willingly work long shifts they will continue to take advantage of you like that. i think you should have a chat with your manager and explain how stressed you are and that it's not going to work in the long term like this	Yoshineedshelp	reply	na	na	na	0.9993392825126648	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety
32m here. I've had similar experience in my old job and I went from mild general anxiety to severe social anxiety only because I had to support my family and couldn't afford to quit at that time so I had to put up with all the stress and anxiety at work till one day I just walked out. Its a couple of years since I quit and the only advice that I can give you is to find a different job ASAP. Trust me it doesn't worth to get sick because of a stupid job. And just know that people can be extremely rude and mean sometimes but don't let them affect you. You mentioned that you felt like you were going insane and thats a symptom of panic attacks which unfortunately I also went through right in front of everyone at work multiple times.

"I (21M) totally understand how you feel. I’m currently a week into my 3 months internship and that whole week has been brutal to say the least. I’m working as a creative intern at this design agency and everything here is so fast paced, my anxiety couldn’t keep up. Every time I’m at work, i just feel like breaking down and crying, but I just keep telling myself to pull through for the 3 months. 

I know it’s hard but every time I’m faced with something so overwhelming, I just keep telling myself that it will pass. More importantly, never ever forsake your mental health for work, or for anyone else. If you aren’t feeling it, don’t be afraid to take a step back and even take days off if needed.

"I've done that so so many times. I know quitting seems like the easiest route but this is a really good opportunity to work through parts of your social anxiety. When places are understaffed like this, everyone is feeling the stress. You are not a failure for feeling overwhelmed! I've done fast food management, cake decorating, all kinds of customer-facing jobs and those feelings come up all the time. I've almost dropped cakes, burned myself when I was a baker, dropped drinks all over the floor, had cash registers go offline in the middle of heavy rushes, you name it and it has happened. 

You can learn to ground yourself and slow these negative thought spirals down. It takes time. I talk to myself in my head. I break down what's going on in the moment and what my next steps are. Sometimes I do a lot of self-soothing like ""You're getting through this."" I had a friend that would do something like point out 5 things they see, 5 things they hear, that sort of thing to ground them in the moment. Just do anything to pull yourself out of those negative thoughts."	Yoshineedshelp	reply	na	na	na	0.9993392825126648	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"Hey, you're definitely not alone. 20F here and I don't work in food service like you do, but in retail. Without naming a name, it's a very popular clothing/home decor department store that gets super busy in the summers. They also cut down hours a lot in the periods where we aren't busy, so now that we're a lot busier, we don't have the staff to accommodate. 

I too had a bad breakdown this week where I had to go to the bathroom and just let it out. It has happened another time before, but at this point I've tried to tell myself that it's not my fault if it gets busy, and it's also nobody's responsibility but the manager's that you don't have enough staff, as some other people have said. I try to be as apologetic as I can be too, but for some customers that's not enough. It's easier said than done because I can't do it either, but the advice I've mostly gotten is to just roll your eyes (internally or externally, depending on where you are) and do what you can. That's all anybody can ask for, really. Keep your head up. :)

Like some others have said though, if it's really that bad, quitting is definitely an option. I left my first fast food job after two years for this reason, and I'll never go back."	Yoshineedshelp	reply	na	na	na	0.9993392825126648	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety

The job seems too stressful, excessively demanding, making you feel burned out. You deserve a break and deserve to be free. Leaving others is hard for sure, but you have to decide what's best for you and put yourself first. 
You could stick longer to see how things go from here. Is it improving, or will you be worse off? Im really hoping management could step in or get the team involved in some sort of meeting so the customer issue could be taken care of. Feel what is right. Keep in touch with close friends if you want they should be totally understanding. For how long you worked is decent. There is no time limit on how long you should work at a place.

Yeah I’ve thought about it a lot. So many people have quit at the job I’m at for good reason. I graduated highschool in 2020 and became mostly home bound for around 2.5 years because I went to college all online. I don’t drive or have friends so being alone all the time made my social anxiety issues I already had, so much worse. It was so hard for me to get up the courage to get this job and part of the reason I chose it is cause I usually don’t have to interact with customers so much except now I do cause of how understaffed we are, and I also don’t have to ever do the cash register much.

I may have to, I’m not sure. But the other thing is if I left I would feel terrible for everyone I’m leaving behind. Everyone is so stressed out and if I left they would be even more short staffed. They have had days were there is no manager and somehow I’m the person there who is in charge even though I’m not a shift lead and I don’t want to be.

That’s true. And I mean it’s not even like it’s a great paying job anyways, I make like $11 an hour plus tips, so it’s like $13 an hour. I just feel bad that they have nobody to work and both the franchise owner and the manager seem to be really struggling but you are right that I guess it’s not just like my responsibility to try to do everything anyways. It gets super overwhelmed when you are doing like 3 jobs at once because they don’t have anyone on certain positions because there isn’t anyone to work.

Okay thank you for the advice! That’s awful that your job made your anxiety worse and I definitely don’t want that to happen to me. Before we were so short staffed, it was making my social anxiety better for me actually, because I didn’t even want to talk to people at all before, but my job made me. But now I’m not so sure, if it’s going to be like this every day. I don’t think I can stand that. I also didn’t know that was a sign of a panic attack, So good to know.

I’m not sure if I will stay at my job or not yet. I guess I’ll just keep seeing how it goes. I have to close again tonight and Saturday nights are always very busy so I will try my best to stay grounded like how you said at least for now.

I’m sorry to here that you also had a hard time this week. :( I had seen other people get extremely fed up/ overwhelmed at my job and I was wondering when it was my turn. I guess it’s just part of the territory kinda for retail and food service. I know that you are right about the customers for sure. Some people just don’t even want to be understanding or nice.

I don’t know if this works for you but I recently started working at an organisation that is currently understaffed. Being a new joinee, I am paired up with a senior person so I can learn from her. Most days she doesn’t complain about being understaffed and goes about her duties quite stressed out. Few days ago, it seemed like she had had enough and she stopped hurrying and stressing out to get tasks done. It’s not her fault that the the place is understaffed. Things did get delayed on the day and people did complain, but she chose not to care. I guess companies will be motivated to take the right steps to attract candidates when employees just do their job and not take on 2-3 people’s job.

It’s definitely a good job to have. Though, I’d say that it’s also a very anxiety inducing job. Dealing with clients can be very… unpleasant. But I could be wrong, when we’re anxious, everything seems to be scary lol.	Yoshineedshelp	reply	na	na	na	0.9993392825126648	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
Sometimes a job will be too much, but you can at least give it your best shot! If it's still too much to manage there's no harm in looking for something else. For me the hardest part of social anxiety in these situations is dealing with all of the pressure I put on myself, it just adds to the natural stress of dealing with customers.

Exactly! All you can do is keep trucking to the next week, keep pushing even when you get knocked down. Sounds really cliche I know but again, like you said about customers, some of them just don't have time for us, likely because it's minimum wage work. Unfortunately they look down on us for that. But yes, definitely consider your options and if things don't get better, and quitting seems to be the best thing for you, definitely do it.

There are certainly some people who come and only do the bare minimum or they just do a decent job and aren’t having so much stress put on them. But the issue is other people who are usually with me aren’t trained or old enough to do both mixing or ovens. It’s frustrating and also cause there isn’t enough managers, so they’ve been leaving me in charge sometimes even though I’m not a shift lead or manager and I don’t want to be.

"I don't even know where to post this. I might be just overwhelmed but feel like I am losing it.

I will try to keep this as short and brief as possible.

I (21m) just started a position at a very prestigious company. I am doing pretty well on my tasks and the bosses are very happy with my work.

The workplace is great, I feel like I am surrounded by really cool, smart and supportive people. 

But besides the work itself, I feel like I am in a great position from which I can grow and advance my career really fast. 

I must mention this is also my first job :))

I have the opportunity to speak and connect with really great people, showcase my skills and pretty much do whatever tf I want. It's just insane  for me. 

Now comes the problem. I am rlly overwhelmed by all the stuff that's happening, and I m really scared of fking it up. It's already been some time since I started and I ve been waiting for this feeling to slowly fade but it doesn't. I am really anxious when meeting these people, I freeze and I can barely talk. I am really in a place in which I feel I can do so much, but I just can't and it's so frustrating. 

I ve been dealing with these feelings my whole life, and I ve had various experiences from which I learned a lot about myself and how to handle such situations, and I am on a good path towards getting better. I'm doing therapy and all good stuff.

But I just feel that I can't fully take advantage of the opportunities I am given and this time I can't just wait to heal and get better. I am really missing out and idfk what to do.

I think if it’s a friendly space making colleagues aware of why you’re like you are is a good idea. If I meet a full blown extrovert I usually dip in with “sorry if I’m a bit wooden, I struggle with SAD and it takes a lifetime for me to relax” it really seems like you’re smashing it though, over time things will get easier.

(24-M) My cousins and my other brothers/sisters have stopped talking to me because I barely socialise with them . Our houses are near but I barely visit them and because of that they also come barely . When we meet at social functions all of them talk and have fun with each other and I am always left out which later becomes the reason for me avoiding social functions since I'm always left out. I also want to have a social life like them and love them and want to be fun around them but everytime we meet I do just the opposite and end up being hated by everyone .They would come and we would have fun few years back but seems like all of them are tired of me now . I don't blame them tho I deserve all the hate for not giving back the same energy . It's not like I don't try I always try to socialise and prepare myself before any social functions  but reality always disappoints .💔💔	Acrobatic-Eagle-4016	post	13.78458310250483	male	White	0.9991859793663025	na	na	na	7	socialanxiety

Try maybe finding the root or your social anxiety, it may have to do with your identity and who you are. Like what are your reasons for not being able to socialize? (Like is it energy? is it shame? is it embarassment, is it being vulnerable) It is clear that you want to go in that direction as you mentioned. Maybe you can start with trying to understand yourself first! When you understand yourself you can be more empathetic to yourself and they will see that you can be comfortable with being who you are.

"I’m writing this while coming to terms with the fact that this is reality and not some nightmare i will wake up from soon.

My closest childhood friend of over 12 years dating back to elementary school, and my college roommate of 5 years, just started treating me like a stranger. It was ten slaps in the face, to put it mildly. The reason? I have no idea. But i do know that one way or another it’s my fault. I trusted her so implicitly that i would go against what everyone around me was saying because I “knew” her. 

I think it started when she literally couldn’t wait to kick me out of her place that we shared living costs for after she graduated a bit earlier than me (i deferred a year), and due to that, along with fear of all the academic pressures and seeing a bleak future, I fell into a deep depressive episode and my social anxiety got exponentially worse as i started trying to think of everything i did to make her so eager to get rid of me. I never asked for too much of her and always paid every expense i could. At times i was the only one paying for living costs at all. I was considerate of her privacy and never, ever betrayed her trust. She will be moving to live with her parents and renting out that space if possible, so it wasn’t even because of a relationship or anything.

During that time, her graduation ceremony happened. I was in another country on vacation and couldn’t attend. She also had expressly told me before that maybe one family member at most would be able to attend because of strict university regulations. By the day of the ceremony, I was so out of touch with reality i couldn’t even send a simple text message. I couldn’t even call. I know it’s horrid of me, I just couldn’t.

Few days later, she posts some pictures of her and ALL of her family members at the party, and with her college friends, all smiling and happy. I just started crying uncontrollably, feeling miserable when i should’ve been happy for her. 

It’s been a week and now I’m finally back in the same country, I got her some stuff she requested from abroad (as i’ve always done and will continue doing), and she’s treating me like an acquaintance. Like all the good and bad stuff we’ve been through together the past 12 years was nothing. Like the way we were sometimes each other’s only anchor was nothing. Like the nights we stayed up until 6 a.m. side by side talking about everything under the sun were nothing. Like the tragedies we supported each other through were nothing. Like the way our families were basically one and the same was nothing. Like the way our playlists of 100’s songs were identical was nothing. 

I WISH she were aggressive towards me instead. I WISH she’d called me up and chewed me out. Instead, she’s all cold pleasantries.
 
Is it because of that damned text message i should’ve sent on that day? Is it because i should’ve called instead? Is it all going to go down the drain just because i was a depressed wreck for a month?

And the most hilarious thing about all of this is, I’m too scared to apologize!! I’m too scared to ask why!! Can you believe how cowardly I am? 

…I’ll be needing a lot of therapy for this one."	socialanxietyandco	post	19.902896197560683	female	White	0.9949445128440857	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety
"Relationships as deep as you are describing are not so easily shaken. 

If there was an issue with the text message you didn’t write, it is nothing you can’t solve by simply talking with her and explaining yourself.

Why are you saying she couldn’t wait to kick you out? What’s making you think that? There is nothing suggesting this in the story you are telling.

I feel like you might be having some big misunderstanding. 

Maybe because of your fragility and emotional state you are interpreting everything as bigger than it is.

I understand you are scared of talking to her, but it looks like you are just destroying your relationship with her for nothing."	socialanxietyandco	reply	na	na	na	0.9949445128440857	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"I mean, is it scarier to just ask and apologize and possibly solve all this? Or to lose your friend, maybe forever?

The more you ignore this, the harder it'll be to solve later.

I know it's hard, I recently lost my first ever friend, my best friend of 17 years. Knew her since we were little.

Let's say her name is ""Stef""
I did everything to solve the problem ( basically, Stef fucked up and my other best friend was sad and mad, but it wasn't being talked about) 
I was mad too about this situation, so I told Stef how I felt. I was really kind about it because I didn't want to hurt her, because maybe she didn't know she fucked up in the first place.


When I confronted her, she didn't acknowledge a single thing she did and just made up excuses for her actions.
I told her that I understood how she may feel, but that maybe she wasn't being empathetic to our other friend.
She progressively got angrier, and continued to act like she was the victim and we were all bad friends, being very manipulative overall. 
So after many tries, I just acted like everything was fine and the problem was solved, and stopped talking to her.


We're on ""good terms"" so she's talked to me a few times since then.
But that's because there's things I'd want to tell her but I don't because I realized what kind of person she is, and it's not worth it.

All this wasn't easy to do. It lasted for around a month, and things progressively got worse. Every time I texted her, told her how I felt, or just thought about her, I would PANIC.
I had insomnia,  my anxiety was through the roof, and I even got sick. I would cry every day and didn't want to get up in the morning because I couldn't deal with how anxious I felt about the situation. 

It's not easy to lose her, It hurts a lot.
But at least I know I TRIED to save this friendship!
I know that I did everything to make things right.
It's been a few months now, and it's definitely gotten easier.

So I think you should just tell her. 
Start by telling her how you feel about her graduation ceremony, tell her you feel bad, and apologize.
I think the conversation will just flow from there.


If it doesn't,  just tell her that she's been acting weird and you want to know why.

If you never ask, you'll never know why. Maybe your anxiety and depression are making things seem worse. Maybe she's dealing with something else.
You can't guess, so ASK! The only solution to most problems is communication.

Even if things go badly, you'll at least tell her how you feel, find out the reason why this is happening, and you'll know that you tried to save the friendship.

It'll be difficult,  but whatever the result is, it's worth it."	socialanxietyandco	reply	na	na	na	0.9949445128440857	weak	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"Ok so I'll spare the boring details. My friend and I (both around 25) had to talk to these 2 girls (who are likely around the same age). 

It was a university setting. And after we started talking it came up what year we're in and she said oh I thought you were X year students (so around 4 years younger)! Then she turned around and told her friend this and she was surprised too. 

I said uh... Ok thank you. And continued what we were talking about.

I know looking young is a good thing when you're older. But at this age being treated like a 'kid' feels so weird.

Any big plans going on?” And from that we started a convo. She said smtg and i put my two cents on it and so on. Gotta do it as casually as u can make it out to be.

I think “trauma” may mean different things to different people. It doesn’t necessarily mean some kind of extreme abuse. Think about when you were in 2,3rd grade. Getting picked on, embarrassed in front of the class, even getting lost in the grocery store  can be a traumatic event for a kid. When we think about it with our adult minds, we might think no big deal, but in our child minds, those events were tantamount to death, we had such a narrow perspective of the world back then.

"I agree with people saying that trauma can be different depending on the person. I also wanted to add that people can just be judgmental in general. Even if you weren’t picked on or have any trauma, even just seeing how other people can be ridiculed for being slightly different can make you more aware of yourself and how others perceive you. I mean at the end of the day, we all just want to fit in. 

I don’t consider myself to have any trauma per say, but I spent more time around adults than children my age when I was really young, and I was also pretty quiet. I think that made me a bit awkward. My dad is also very judgemental. Sometimes towards me but more so towards others. I would listen to him nitpick about any person he comes across for things that would never cross my mind.

"It might not be SERIOUS trauma, but there's always at least a small situation that awakes that fear.

I know my social anxiety started when I was little.
I fell and dropped food in a kindergarten event, where we had to serve food to a bunch of parents. 
There was a circle of tables, and I was in the middle. It felt like a stage. 
And I just fell. 
Of course, I was like 3/4 years old, so even though I remember the panic, it didn't affect my life much at the time.
But as I got older, and more things happened, my symptoms got worse.


At 6 years old, I couldn't call my classmates for homework, was afraid of raising my hand in class, and couldn't even get up to go where the trashcan was so I could sharpen my pencil. Just because I had to walk across the room and everyone would see me.
(Very specific, but that's something I remember clearly)



I DO think some people have a higher probability of developing SA, I have ADHD and rejection sensitivity is one of the symptoms.
Those events, as dumb as they sound, were very traumatic. I'm 20, and I think about them.
Also, because of my ADHD my social skills were and sometimes are still kind of ass, and socializing can be a big challenge.
So I have more probabilities of looking like a fool, Lol

Most of my ""trauma"" comes from my undiagnosed self struggling to talk to people, not listening, or not remembering instructions for certain things, therefore messing things up in public.


I was made fun of and teased a lot, too. 
Some of it seemed harmless, but looking back, I think that completely destroyed my confidence.
Even a ""harmless joke"" or just a little teasing can do a lot to someone's head. Because, as innocent as the intention may be, it is also some kind of humiliation in the end.

And SA comes from that fear or being humiliated, right?
Of looking ridiculous and people making fun of you or judging in some way. 


I could be wrong, but I don't think people are just born with SA. 
Maybe you have trauma. Maybe it's insecurities. Maybe you were overprotected.  Maybe people thought that it's fine to tease you all the time and you expect everyone to do the same. It could be anything, really.

I think it can definitely be a thing even without trauma. I think I’ve had SA ever since I can remember, so even before kindergarten. I obviously can’t remember much from that time but I do remember being in pre-k (is it called that in English?) I was already a bit scared to talk to other kids, but that might have been just shyness idk.

"My grandpa shows a lot of signs of social anxiety, my dad has it and I have it. It's difficult to tell with social anxiety because it's not easily differentiated from bad habits caused by trauma since a person with trauma and a person who simply has the disorder will behave very similarly. While there is also the idea that a person with the disorder can receive bullying/abuse due to the disorder in the first place making it harder to distinguish what stems from the disorder and what stems from the trauma.

For example I had a very happy childhood with both my parents and can't remember any trauma but due to SA I had bad social relations. I got some bad habits from those and while I did get treated unfairly due to being quiet often, it's clear today that I wrongly perceived the way people were treating me as bad when it wasn't meant that way. Nowadays I'm able to distinguish if someone is being mean or not but my social anxiety is still there despite it. It can even come when I'm happy with friends or with family that I like.

If it's genetic like in my case (it seems) you can still use therapy as it helps identify what are bad habits and what is simply part of the disorder and lets you combat them in real life as eventually, you'll be able to recognize when the Anxiety disorder is affecting you and you'll learn how to react to it. Eventually it's possible that medication could help but you need the follow up of a psychiatrist and possibly to try various medications before it works."

SA creates trauma for people with sa especially if you only notice it in your early twenties and have been having it since your early teenage. It does for me.

I'm 21 and going 22 in my last year of college. My therapist and doctor talk to me about it and how a late reach out could pile up a lot of trauma due to SA.

I learnt how to be wary of people because my mum is very untrusting of anyone outside the family. I think that kinda set off this very hesitant behaviour when meeting new kids. It became a self fulfilling prophecy, other kids avoided me because I was avoidant of them, which made me even more socially anxious because the way I made sense of it was because something was wrong with me.

"I'd say it's small 'T' trauma. People like to throw the word trauma around because it has horrific life experience connotations, suggesting that there definitely IS something 'wrong' with them.

I feel like I had a pretty good childhood.. but looking back I was bullied somewhat, I didn't have social interactions modelled to me by my parents very well because they like to avoid interactions too, I didn't go to my parents about my problems out of shame, my problems weren't noticed by my parents enough for them to sit me down and ask me what was going on. This could be considered neglect on their part. Not deliberate, but my needs still weren't met. I grew up with some messed up ideas about myself that weren't noticed and addressed. Now it's up to me to do what my parents didn't do for me.

When I watch videos about trauma recovery I can see myself in many of the symptoms and behaviour associated with it. I have reactions to things that are not uncommon in traumatised people (being 'triggered' by things).

Your own personality can exacerbate things too. High trait neuroticism particularly.

teasing is perceived as play between people with high self estem, and as bullying between people with low self esteem. the very same person even, can have one reaction or the other depending on their emotional state and not even feel how paradoxical it may seem to an outsider.

Yes, agreed. Having read many many studies on this, one might be born with certain qualities that are more susceptible to having social anxiety (temperament, for example or family history of it) but there isn't anything that states there's a chemical imbalance and then boom it's fixed. Social anxiety is, unfortunately, something that builds up through many tiny moments or maybe a few big ones. But again, it's something that can be worked on and be managed successfully. It's all in how we think about ourselves and the people around us. A lot of inner reframing needs to occur.	ZombieWookie77	reply	na	na	na	0.0106385238468647	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety

"No we are anxious, not shy/timid/coy. Social anxiety has symptoms because it is a mental disorder. Being shy, insecure or a loner are not symptoms. They are part of someone's personality. Social anxiety is not me being shy, it is feeling like my mind is shutting down in a social setting to the point where my body starts physically reacting to it. It is triggering the sympathetic nervous system. Its not a personality trait.

I feel this. I have no issues with teasing when I'm feeling okay about myself. When I'm already low and insecure, teasing can definitely feel like bullying.

It can also be: criticism over your appearance, behavior, etc. Watching others being judgmental in front of you frequently or being judgmental of you, not allowed to express emotions such as sadness or anger, instability at home. Things like that.

"I'm 21, was sheltered to an unfathomable degree for many due to bad homeschooling, and never had any friends. Growing up I had no chances to make them (aside from online friends, but even the few people I talked to online were villainized for no reason by my parents). And as an adult, I've been too depressed, anxious, and insecure to be a good friend for anyone, so I haven't even really tried yet.  
  
It really seems like having no one in your life you're close to outside of your immediate family is very frowned upon. Definitely feeling kind of like a loser and undesirable as hell to others because of my complete lack of experience with social relationships.

I was never good at communicating with other people growing up and even now in my 30s I still struggle with communicating with other people. But I’m open about this. 

I’ve had people call me a loser and a loner before. I just don’t really care what other people think. In fact when I’ve been called a loner or a loser, I just agree with them.

"I think a person is only a loser if they act like an ass towards others just because they feel like they live miserable lives and have the need to have everyone else feeling just as miserable as them.

Not having a friend isn't a reason to be considered a loser.That's loser talk with intention to shame people for not having friends.Which means, that is bullying and bullies are the real losers.

Friendship isn't a chore nor is something that you ""have to have"".It is something that you can develop with other people because you ""click together"" and find meaning and value in interacting with each other and you ""want to keep doing so"".

Yes, it is harder to make friends as an adult, but not impossible.

People that give you crap for ""not having friends"" aren't really friend material themselves.

"Yes it's frowned upon, but that doesn't mean people are correct for it. The correct answer is not at all unless it was by your own deserved doing, which it is clearly not in your case. Don't let what others think get to you so much.

I don't think there is anything such as ""good enough to have friends"". Now, idk how much of these you are, but you feeling lonely and anxious and depressed because you don't know how to be around people but at the same time not even trying to make friends might be your brain being scared and making this up to keep you feeling safe from the risk of trying, which is fine, but it's just a block you'll eventually have to get over if you want any friends.

">it's going to come to the point when they're going to wonder about my other friends or buddies that don't exist, and I have to reveal that I don't have anyone.

I relate so much to this! I'm also 21, and just started making friends a couple months ago. I never had any close friends either since 4th grade, and no friends at all since 9th grade. I'm at the point where I still dont have close friends yet, but surface level friends from the clubs I joined in college. It's the first time I've connected with anyone in years. I was also very sheltered even though I was in public school, I also had online friends that my parents frowned upon (usually they were right tho). Its always awkward and painful to have your friendless past haunt you when you're trying to make new friends. It's hard when they start asking questions. That's when you try to make friends in multiple different groups. Join some groups based around common interests and you will easily find people. Let yourself be seen with other people and they will be less likely to ask questions. Never let yourself get too attached to one group or even just a couple of people, always diversify so you have many opportunities and you aren't just always waiting around  for one group of people or one person to reconnect with you. It will be hard sometimes to make friends who have other closer friends so that's why you make sure you have lots of people to talk to."

"First of all, my socially anxious parent homeschooled me through elementary school so that's relatable☹️.

Socially healthy people do have friends, but they also seem to usually hang out with their families and be constantly down to make new friends. I think if you emphasize that you hang out with your family and are interested in making friends that will come across as socially fine 

I think people dont respond well to hearing someone doesnt have friends becuase they think you wont know how to be a friend (and then immature people take it further call/think of people as ""losers"") but even if theres some truth in you not having perfect social skills, skills can be learned  

But if your goal is to have friends, i think looking at it like you only have to find 1 person who doesn't care that you don't have any friends as opposed to hoping all of society won't care.

"I’m 18 and only have like 3 really close friends, and the rest range from good friends to more like acquaintances, but still not more than like 10 in total. Those 3 friends all have their own mental health issues (especially my best friend) and they live kinda far away from me so we rarely meet up after graduating from high school last year. When we text it usually takes quite a while from them to answer (if they answer at all) and most of the time I’m the one initiating the conversation. It honestly often upsets me a bit because it’s really hard for me to go out and make friends and the ones I have sometimes make me feel like I don’t really exist or matter yk (I know they don’t do it in purpose because they all have their own shit going on). The one friend I have that I talk to really often lives in a different country so also no chance of socializing much there. The other friends don’t really talk to me if I’m not the one sending the messages first so I often end up wondering if they just don’t care about me or if they maybe don’t have time to remember me because they are busy hanging out with their own friends. 

Idk it sucks quite a lot, but as you can see going to an in-person school doesn’t automatically mean you have great friends.

"Well.. about 10 years ago, in my “wild” years, I was out at this local bar with a different girl I was dating at the time. We’ll call her “the redhead” for the sake of this story. It was me, the redhead, some of her friends and her brother. Her brother is more socially awkward than I am. He had just gone through a break up and after a couple beers he decides he wants to try to meet a girl and asked me to wingman it for him. Idk why the fuck he would ask me. Since I’m awkward and never knew how to talk to girls. I’m lucky I ever got married. Anyways my redhead girlfriend at the time was cool with it. After one cringy attempt at approaching a group of girls. We were about to abort the whole mission. When I noticed two girls at the other end of the bar. I said to the redhead’s brother, “hey how about the one down there.” And nodded at her. Little did I know at the time, this girl would eventually become my wife. She made eye contact with me and I smiled back at her and winked at her. Honestly just acting stupid. Keep in mind I had a girlfriend at the time. Not that it was anything serious. I also already had several beers and was being silly. She turned around and whispered to her friends, whom I knew. I didn’t know this at the time but my wife told me years later that she was asking them about me and she said I was really cute. Blah blah blah. Anyways me and the redheads brother started talking to someone else and forgot about her. 

Three years later I was back at the same bar. I was heavily depressed and anxiety ridden and in a really rough spot in my life. Lots of life changing events were happening and I just wanted to get out. This same girl that was my future wife came up to me at the bar with a friend of hers and tried to talk to me. I kind of blew her off. I honestly wasn’t interested in anything at the time. I hated my life and was riddled with anxiety. I couldn’t keep myself happy let alone a girl.

Fast forward to about a week later an old high school buddy randomly reached out to me. He was going through some shit also and wanted to go bar hopping. We hit up 4 bars and we were ready to call it a night when we decided to go to one last bar. This is the same bar I saw my future wife at twice before. We walk into this bar and it was completely empty besides the bar tender and two other girls, my future wife and a friend of hers. I turn and look at her and we just stare. I start laughing and just walk right up her and start talking as if we’ve known each other our whole lives. I already knew she had the hots for me and I was very very drunk at the time. 

Anyways I got her phone number. Started dating and eventually got married. 

My wife knows me better than anyone else. She knows I’m anti social and I don’t have any friends. We joke about it all the time. My wife is the most social person in the world and has tons of friends and a huge family. I don’t. I just don’t care. My wife doesn’t care either. I’m happy. I love my life. 5 days ago on August 1st my wife gave birth to our first baby. It’s a boy. I have a bunch of fun hobbies that keep me busy. I have a decent house, good paying job, I started my own small business, I own newer cars, i have goals set in life. I’m happy.

"I've graduated and scored a pretty decent job but its not what I initially planned to do while I was getting my degree. The career lane I'm in now makes much less money than the career I hoped for and I have to put a lot of energy into it because of my social anxiety. To sum it up, I rushed through my computer science degree and I had to quickly move more into IT and I don't know where to go next. So if any one here is in IT can you recommend what area of expertise is the least painful? Networking? Database? Security? I'm open to anything.

I just need to find an area of focus so I can start moving forward because I feel the need to study any and everything and its a bit overwhelming and my current job is customer facing most of the day. I want to make sure I'm putting my effort into something that is not going to rile up my anxiety so much. 

I hope this is on topic enough. I had to make a post because I can barely make it through the day with my social anxiety just to be getting payed dust."	r-e-w-13	post	25.189389198863044	female	White	0.9788423180580139	na	na	na	1	socialanxiety
If I were in IT, I would focus on database administration. Learning Structured Query Language (SQL) is not that difficult, and it can enable you to branch out into data analyst jobs. My second choice would be security. Networking seems easy in theory, but if the whole network is down, you will never hear the end of it from customers and supervisors above you until you fix the issue.	r-e-w-13	reply	na	na	na	0.9788423180580139	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"Ever since social media was a thing (probably since year 7 in secondary school when Facebook was reaching its peak of popularity). The idea of having my life on a feed for everyone else to see; seeing pictures of me and developing first impressions of me without me even being there, just terrified me. Even putting this here ain’t like me. 

Anytime I tried to use it I would completely overthink how my pictures looked or even the words I’d type, I’d re-do it and re-do it until I just wouldn’t bother. 

I’ve never had any social media other than Snapchat (which I only talk to people that I know well as it’s easy to share things but never post publicly).

I even get anxious about what people think about me for not having it as I’ve heard it’s a ‘red flag’ and makes me seem odd. 

Sometimes I just feel alone in this, and feel like I am isolating myself further by not having instagram ect. as nowadays it feels like this is how people form connections…Hence this post.

And to anybody that uses it and enjoys it, am I missing out? Is it something I should overcome and make accounts or am I better off without?"	Cute_Vacation	post	10.797671546135206	male	White	0.9978618025779724	na	na	na	30	socialanxiety

"Yes but I look at this as a positive thing. Sharing a lot of your life and self on social media especially image based ones, forces you into curating an online persona/presence and that's probably not healthy at all.

Just scrolling the apps and consuming the content exposes you to so much advertising and clever marketing designed to influence your emotions, make you keep scrolling, encourage you to feel bad about yourself and the world, and buy stuff.

Internet addiction is also really common and easy to fall into. Have a look at /nosurf

"As you said, people are always trying to make their posts perfect. People only show the best moments of their lives and even editing if necessary, creating an unrealitically perfect appearance of live.

Everytime you see somebody's post, your ego is checked and we unconsciously compare ourselves with the other's life we are seeing at the screen. Comparing means doubting about ourselves and feeling insecure. This doesn't have other name than social anxiety. So, Instagram and social media inevitable leads to more social anxiety.

Social media can’t say much for how a person is in real life.

"Today's my 19th birthday, and there is a big WWE PPV an hour away from me tonight. One of my step-cousins, who I don't know very well, has a wedding scheduled for today that I never agreed or promised to go to. 

I was planning on going to this PPV a month ago, but all my friends are busy and my brother is working at yellowstone, so I figured there was no point in going by myself. I did have a small celebration with the rest of my family this morning, but I feel very lonely today tbh.

Now I've decided that I want to go to the PPV anyway. I feel like it would be good for me to push myself and go alone for once, and maybe I could meet a few fellow fans there and have some fun. Plus WWE almost never had PPVs in Detroit anymore so it's kind of a big deal.

Idk should I do it? I'm kind of tired of sitting around and waiting for something good/fun to happen to me, and I can't stand hiding from the world anymore.

"So I did actually follow through and go by myself 🤗 and while I am happy that I was able to leave my comfort zone and proud that I actually did it, I probably won't go to another PPV or live show alone lol. It sucked being alone because I felt like a stranger in a crowd of 60k people, so that didn't feel great, but that was kind of the point so 🤷 It's definitely more fun with a friend just because you actually have someone to talk to and chant with without feeling weird, but I can officially say that I am able to go alone 🎊


The worst part was driving through downtown Detroit during rush hour, it was hell trying to find a place to park. Also trying to leave Detroit after the PPV was terrible lol. I was stuck in the parking garage for almost 4 hours. I grudgingly admit that I started crying because of how stressed/scared I was to try and get out of Detroit. Not proud of that 😑 The good thing was that the time I got out of the parking garage, the streets were almost COMPLETELY empty. Biggest sigh of relief I ever made.

I made a comment to my mom about how I didn't have money for something and she said If I had a job I would. As if I don't know that? Its beyond frustrating that I can't hold a job, and to know that most people take it for granted. I recently saw a therapist and told them about how I have no social life and can't hold down a job. Their advice? Go out and talk to people and apply for jobs. I'M HERE BECAUSE I CAN'T DO THAT. Maybe exposure helps some people, but I never felt like I was getting more comfortable.

"I mean your therapist is kind of right. You can’t improve yourself socially without social interactions. There’s nothing internal that can help that. It’s like worrying about how you can’t gain muscle but being annoyed when people tell you that you need to hit the gym and eat more protein.

Since it’s really debilitating rn, just focus on small goals. Talk to people online if you’re too scared to do it in public, talk to your mom more often, etc.

"Im 17 now. My whole life I felt this way, with social anxiety, when I try to talk to people i dont know, that feeling in my stomach gets worse and worse with butterflies i get so nervous and cant do anything.. sorry if that sounds vague I dont know how to describe it.  I cannot approach people or talk to them most likely due to fear of judgement and rejection this is all my fault though. I wasted my life doing this, not having a solid friend. I never had a childhood or any friends for that matter except for a few of which I make completely random but they all moved away or stop talking anyway. When I become friends with some by accident or something else I feel very comfortable and talk and talk and talk. But they all lose touch.  In 2020 COVID time I did online school, in 2021-2022 I had the choice to go back, that same feeling always fucking comes and I choose to stay all the time.

Even with my family/cousins  whom I havent seen I feel the same way and cant talk to them. For example I visited my two cousins and uncle in a Airbnb I wanted to bond with them and I said hi everyday and kinda tried but ultimately my fear stopped that and I always make everything awkward. This paralyzing fear in me ruins everything and I hate it.. I hate being lonely I've been in online school for 3 years, it's my senior year now and I could go back but since I'm like this I can't im wasting everything... I just want a friend, I know it's pathetic to cry about it on the Internet but I'm going to do just that.

I tried making friends online but alas it didn't work. I even am fearful of what people think online.

I'm terribly awkward with conversations, don't know how to start or keep going. I in my entire life was attention seeking for the wrong thing, pretending to be stuff that I'm not all the time

I don't want to be lonely. I don't want to be lonely so bad but I don't even try it's my fault but I'm so scared.. I have the choice to go in my senior year but the fear is coming again and again.. and even if I do go back.. I would be the same awkward person I can never make friends.

I can't take it anymore I'm gonna be like this forever I want this to stop. I have no friends everyone I know is separating from me.. I have my family I love them. Even if my family fucked up .. but I just want someone to be my friend..

Also I'm painfully shy.... Also this contributes to the fact that my whole life i looked like a grown ass man (I'm tall AF with a beard yayahyyy)

Online never works.. no ones on and not really a friend they all have their own friends.........

No, it's a common lie. I walk right up to woman. And when I run out of bravado and I crumble in a social setting they are considerate of my feelings. This is true that they admire bravery but I think they like more that you're willing to step out of your comfort zone at all. As a man I can say other men are wrong and stupid because there are plenty of woman out there for you. There are plenty who are not, but don't perceive failure and never find out. I know that's difficult with SA. But just pretending to be confident helps by yourself because it's like rehearsing what to say. If all else fails tell them of your shortcomings.

I try putting my hands in my pockets or crossing them or using my phone but I just look weird no matter what I do.

It is a cycle.The more you think about how you stand,the more self-conscious, awkward you'll become.The only way out is to turn your attention outward.It will make your body language natural.	Fit-Weight-7429	reply	na	na	na	0.9994408488273621	no	no	no	na	socialanxiety
"This is gonna sounds kinda weird I guess, but I would say stand akrward on purpose

Even more awkward than you think you're standing now

Why? Because you will get used to the judgement and won't care about people looking at you or commenting anymore...


From the health perspective tho, you might wanna look up some physical exercises to fix your posture, there might be some muscles in your body that need activating to allow you to stand ""normal"" 

""Normal"" because everyone is different and everyone stands and walks different, that's okay. 

I would pay attention to the health side more than social side, because bad posture over a long period of time can cause a lot of other problems, also better posture will help with confidence too 


And when it comes to mental exercise, try looking up ""5 senses meditation"" or ""inner body meditation"" these are exercises designed to help you stop being stuck in your thoughts

"
I’m 24 and have been learning to drive since I graduated high school.  I know it’s embarrassing. 

I wasn’t allowed to get my L’s in high school because of most of my family members. My auntie thought I was too un-coordinate to drive. It annoyed me

Turns out they were right lol. I’m 24 now and I’ve failed my P’s about 4-5 times through out the years. I have had 3 different driving instructors and spent so much of my parents money on it. And learned with my parents on and off.  

The teacher told me I did good during the lesson. most likely got nervous during the test!!!!!

So anyways. I renewed my L’s about a month ago because it expired last year lol.  

I’ve been driving my dads car home after work at 6pm everyday.  Everything was going well until today when I got confused/scared with lane changing. I normally take the left lane but went into the right and got nervous - failing to signal as a car drove past and beeped at me.

Not to mention almost crashing into a car from the right hand at the round about yesterday. WHEN I KNOW u should always give way to the right hand side, it happened anyways. 

My dad got scared. And right now I am lowkey reminded why I wanted to give up driving a year ago.  Why I took half a year to even renew my L’s.  

My father keeps repeating CONCENTRATE. PAY ATTENTION. The exact same thing my instructors and whenever I get in trouble at work by multiple different bosses at different jobs.

It all comes back down to the intelligence test I took.  For a while now I’ve been wondering if I could be ADHD. Or have a learning disability. Most likely the latter

And you know what? I sought out a doctor, took a test and Turns out I have AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. I HAVE SUSPECTED THIS ALL MY LIFE - thst I’m slower at learning than EVERYONE ELSE! Now there’s A LABEL to make me feel even shittier about myself. 

still waiting to find out if it’s ADHD or to dismiss it entirely. Deep down I know I’m not ADHD, I’m just slow/stupid.

My psychologist did note that I’m low I’m memory and concentration, retrieval of Information. And that “it can be improved by playing memory games”.  

After knowing this.  And being constantly told to ‘concentrate’ while driving.  Most times I can, but other times I find myself zoning out.. Maybe I’m not cut out for driving. I’m just going to endanger myself and others, THATS WHY THEY WONT GIVE ME MY P’s, JUST LIKE SPONGEBOB!! WHO NEVER PASSES HIS DRIVING TEST 

I hate driving man. I could have been the cause of a car accident with my dad as the passenger today AND THE DAY BEFORE.

My Mum these days pushes me to get my P’s so I can drive to work instead of taking the train/bus all the time. It was the complete opposite a few years back which is kind of funny. 

Get my P’s at least, right?  prove myself for once!
It’s embarrassing enough I’ve had 3-4 driving instructor and spent so much and my parents still encourage looking for another one.  It’d be soo embarrassing to pay a former instructor from a year ago. 

What if I pay all this money for them to take me to do the test just to fail all over again.  Just like piano and swimming lessons, like my Asian mother pointed out. Failure. Failure. Failure. 

I know it’s my disability that’s kept me from getting it as fast as other people.  Part of me just wants to give up and say driving isn’t for me,  the other half wants to keep trying and feel happy to have achieved something.

"I've passed my driving test on 7th attempt and avoided driving for almost 6 years. Then I just bought an automatic car. It's so much easier. Changing the gears messed me up a lot, too much things to concentrate on.

"I'm terrified of people, and avoidant to the point where I've quit multiple jobs. I get nauseous and cry uncontrollably when anticipating future interactions and lose sleep ruminating on past ones. I'm extremely sensitive to even the slightest hints of judgement, irl or online.

But my anxiety doesn't stem from any trauma. I was never abused or bullied. I don't suffer from poor self-esteem. In fact, I like myself quite a bit. I enjoy my own company and appreciate my own work. I'm just scared of failing in my endeavor to *prove myself to others*.

I'm prideful. I obsess about what people think of me. I hold myself to such importance that I'm deathly afraid of embarrassing myself, tarnishing my reputation, being criticized or laughed at. I grew up receiving A's and awards and praise, and it went to my head. I went into adulthood believing that kind of reception is the only acceptable one, and now I'm too scared to risk experiencing less.

The only cure is to stop taking myself so seriously. To let go of my ego, separate myself from the situation, accept that I'm a screw-up, and laugh at myself. Surrender to others instead of resisting. Take some jabs. Take some Ls. Stop caring about myself so much. Actually connect with other people rather than obsess over how well I'm performing. Even if people hate me and think I'm cringe, it doesn't matter because I'm not that important in the grand scheme of things. I'll just be the weird guy that nobody likes, and that's fine. Takes all kinds to make a world.

Being self-conscious is being too attached to your ego. So attached that, when it takes damage, you feel pain. I have to stop *being* an ego, and instead just *do* things, like a disembodied entity that actually functions, without worrying about what it *is*. Have you ever met a really kind, happy, confident person? It's like they don't even have an ego. They don't worry about what people think of them at all. They laugh at themselves all the time.

People often imagine sufferers of social anxiety to be something like kicked puppies, victims of a cruel world. And maybe that's the case for some people. But treating this condition with therapeutic drones of, ""Don't worry, everyone likes you, you are enough,"" etc can backfire for people like me. What I really need to hear is, ""Dude, you're taking yourself too seriously!"""	healthRestored	post	27.70744383155106	female	White	0.0041182562708854675	na	na	na	2	socialanxiety

"So, as the title says, she has SA, we are penpals, met IRL. She had opened up to me little by little over the years. 

Long story short, we met in May (was akward but I went by her). Spent good/modest time together. Had good energy ect. Maybe I am being blinded but I did always think she fancied me, but would never say anything given her shyness/SA.

She started having something going on in June, her mood changed (my time knowing her she gets triggers where she closes off sometimes over the years). She told me something that bothered me/hurt me, later I told her I fancied her (probably the worst thing I can say/do, especially if she had things going on). She was surprised I felt that way, but turned me down nicely.. 

I asked again a few weeks later since to me i felt she let fear dictate her decision. Reading about SA i read that you can push people away. When i asked 2nd time she never gave me a straight answer other than she wishes she could but she can't, she doesn't want to hurt me, but all she can say is she has vacation in Oct, and plans to go either to her dream vacation(a place where i think will be hard to go if you have SA/are a woman in the idea of being  judged ect), visit me, or stay home, watch the rain and cry. (She had never traveled abroad before) She will book her ticket late Aug/early Sept, and she will see where to - that was all she was able to say. I asked if she could at the very least let me know in a perfect world of she fancies me and she coulnt, and asked if we can leave the topic open and get to it some other time.

3 weeks later, we haven't entirely talked much. It feels mega awkward. I feel foolish and hurt for opening up and making myself vulnerable. I view it that she has control/power and ball is in her court, but her having SA, I am sure it is very hard for her. Unless she doesn't think about me the way I do - who knows. I did tell her many times, especially after the fact that anything I can do I am here for her and not to hesitate to ask. 

Not sure entirely what I need, advice, comments, or just vent.. but it really sucks and I have a hard time opening up my own feelings and talking about them too. 😢"	ReadyAbbreviations63	post	25.99930490863469	male	White	0.9991950392723083	na	na	na	9	socialanxiety
"If she said no the first time, why did you ask again?

If a guy friend expresses romantic interest in me and I don't feel the same, I usually distance myself as well so that I avoid giving him false hope. You mention that she was very kind in her rejection, but you still asked again just two weeks later, which might have made her feel like you don't respect her decision. On top of that, the repeated confession might have put pressure on her to accept which might be triggering her SA as she likely saw you as a trustworthy friend and doesn't want to lose you.

Bottom line, if you want to save this **friend**ship, give up any hope for a romantic relationship. She has told you no, and if you don't make it clear that you respect that and have given up hope for it, then you may lose your friend entirely."

I haven't personally ever dated a girl but having SA, I can say that at certain times I will have the occasional mood swings but if she's going thru the same feeling I would've been thru sometimes that would probably be the reason but it's a hard feeling to explain as it's just something someone with anxiety or similar would be able to explain.

"Hi! Thanks for the message! I can chime in a bit and provide more information. 

I met her in early May. Weve talked on/off 5 years. We live in other countries, but I was born in her country(Poland). She happens to come 30 minutes from where my family comes from. (I still have family there so me visiting isn't an issue).

After I left to home, she did tell me in early June that she was getting the blues. We did chat maybe a week or so after she told me that anf i can tell she was iin a poor mood. She never left the country and one of her dreams/goals to prove to herself was to go to Qatar in October. She told me that she was prepping/buying things for it and I think it was just playing in her head/getting overwhelmed about not making that happen (she was supposed to go somewhere last summer and broke her foot/ankle and was mega depressed all summer). So it was the fear/stress she won't go. 

She happened to make a comment to me around this time in early June that she was fine waiting 10 years to meet me again. I got hurt by that since I had other stress/things going on at that time and not in a proper mood that i never got back to her. She reached out to me few days later and I apologized for being quiet and that is when I told.her I was bothered by her comment and said that I actually do like her and cared about her and would like to continue to get to know her as more than a friend and if she needed time she can take the time since I know it's hard and i don't want to complicate things.

She responded that she didn't think I could feel that way. It is a dream of hers to get find someone who understands her, get married and have a family, but there is a distance between us, and she is not a good person to be friends with, yet alone anything more. She has a hard time talking about it and didnt know wjat to say. She has lots of dark demons and dark thoughts. All valid things, but I just personally thought we could work past that.  Then next time we meet will be me invited her to my wedding in 10 years. For whatever reason she said if she was younger she would consider it. 

I read later on about SA, and I read that people can tend to react out of fear and push people away. So I asked her the second time a few weeks later if she can let me.know if she would ever think of me as a more than a friend, and reiterated what I had said before, and I understand the distance but we come from the same area and it can be doable, I just would prefer trying something than regretting never trying. I really felt/thought she was letting fear dictate her decision,.and it's easier to push away so I asked her again and I would understand, but I don't want her to let fear dictate her decision. 

This is when she said that is very true words because she is a self sabotager, she ruins everything, and everytime she gets opportunities to make her dreams come true she runs away from them out of fear. She is scared of everything - and what will come next month. But she can't answer my question whether she fancies me ""🙈"" <- left that exact emoji, and asked if we can return to it another time. Only thing is that she can say was late aug/Sept she will book her ticket. Qatar was something she wanted to do to prove to herself, or she thinks about visiting me but then thinks ""it's far and then what? Ect"" but she ends up thinking she will not go anywhere and just cry at home. She didn't want to give false hope (as you said) other than to let me know Aug/early Sept she will probably book her ticket, and she has no idea where she will go. 

So that's pretty much it. Haven't talked that much anymore other than very quick messages every once in a while. I tried being friendly in that time, and she was cold and it made me feel foolish for trying to reach out. Then she opened up somewhat with very simple chats. So it's awkward and complicated. I told her from the beginning I didn't want to put more on her, and complicate things, but I did feel obligated to share my feelings too. Maybe I did screw up - I don't know. :/

Again, sorry for such a long message/all the details."	ReadyAbbreviations63	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9991950392723083	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"Thanks! I've read about SA and it makes a lot of sense in how her personality works. I think I narrowed down what her recent trigger was. Her and I do have similar personalities, and I know I can overthink things and I know how mentally draining it can be. I am sure it is a million times worse for her.

I just am hurt myself and confused with the whole situation... i don't like talking about my feelings but i opened up, made myself vulnerable and feel foolish now. She holds the cards and she knows how I feel. It's up to her to make the decision since she was not able to give me a yes/no answer if she fancies me.

I just don't know if it would be harder for her if I go quiet and distance myself? Is this too much pressure for her? Am I expecting more from her than she cab give?

 Before we met she kept telling me she thought I'd meet her a few minutes and then run away and couldn't explain why she thought that way."	ReadyAbbreviations63	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9991950392723083	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"Honestly I have bad SA, but if I truly am romantically interested in someone, I invest more in it than I should. No fear in the world would stop me from trying to be with you most of the time. In fact since I have SA, I’m more likely to look for your company since I don’t have too many other social contacts or the friends I have.. well they’re not as comfy as being with you.

Most of the time I’m just not interested into people whenever they try to ask me out. I’m bad at being honest then. I try to find whatever reason like “I’m not ready” “if I was younger” “I did consider you at a point” “maybe someday” “my life just is just a mess right now” and so much more. I’m scared of hurting others with being blunt and honest so I’m not able to hit them with the proper truth of not being interested in them. Hoping they’ll take the hint and leave me. That’s also when I distance myself and don’t talk that much. 

I’m not proud that I’m like this, but it is the way it is. Yet if it’s someone I fell for, they’re the one person I want to be with the most.

Edit: I always hope that the people will take the hint and stop pursuing me romantically. I open up convos, hoping they’ll want to remain a friendship. Since I value them as friends."	ReadyAbbreviations63	reply	na	na	na	0.9991950392723083	no	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
Again its super hard for anyone to really figure anything out especially strangers like us on here, but at the most what I can hopefully recommend is prayer as god really is the only one who can help out in this case since it relates to feelings. but honestly speaking one of the reasons ive never really tried the dating this is because of my mood changes as I was telling you about that feeling us SA people can get and im in my early 20s. At one point all will be well but then out of no where it begins to seem too much the closest ive ever gone is talking to a girl online then eventually just trying to explain why it wont work out as its that feeling I would get.

"Thanks for your reply! I appreciate it!

Maybe I have read into everything the wrong way. That is what I would think that if she really did fancy me she would be more open to it. But I just think the fear is what kicked in and she had been in a tough mood. She still is I think.

Prior to my visiting, she was scared of communicating more, but with time and patience she opened up and we did phonecalls/,video. She really did seem Ike she fancied me and made comments where someone with SA would probably never say.

When it came to me meeting, we talked weekly(I wanted to feel comfortable enough ahead of time). She kept saying that she is scared/thinks I'd meet her and then run away and only gave ""🤷🏼‍♀️"" whenever I asked her why she said that. 

I went to visit family in Poland and met her while I was there. The initial meeting was awkward and I thought I would get stood up. The night before that she asked if we can talk, and that is when she told me she hates herself and thinks everyone around her think the same. But she agreed to meet the following day. She later told me her mom talked sense to her.i appreciated her strength and told her i am sure it was harder for her than it was for me. Afterwards the times we spent I know she did enjoy my company, I met her parents and she met my mom. It really was good energy. I know she struggles talking about things/opening up so I thanked her again for it.

Anyway, again, maybe I miss read everything. Maybe it is not fear/natural reaction of fight/flight, and she actually doesn't fancy me. It just seems very awkward and complicated, and it's always been difficult to talk to her sometimes where she can be very open, and other times she can be very cold and short. 

Me opening up, making myself vulnerable (I hate talking about my feelings) getting shut down/not getting a full straight answer other than ""I wish i could answer you but i can't - late Aug/early Sept i will book my ticket andI will see where i go"" just makes it hard for me and awkward. She also said she doesnt want to make promises and give hopes and hurt me - but ive been feeling hurt already. I have my own form of anxiety, and thinking about this has been very hard. Feeling foolish after opening up, reaching out to her to try and chat and get a cold/short response would make it worse. At the same time, I don't want to make it look like I will dissappear because of her SA. 

So I will probably cancel our plans to talk tomorrow since I inquired about it it shouldn't matter. I rrally am not up for it. Tell her I am not up for it, but I will still be here if she ever needs anything not to hesitate. She does know how I feel, it is coming up to the time frame she mentioned,  and there is nothing I can say/do. It will give me time to work on my feelings and let myself in a better place. It just doesn't help since it hasn't been a straight reply other than ""I wish I could answer your question but I can't- leave it open and we can maybe return to it another time"".

Anyway- again, I appreciate your response and I apologize for my long rant. It's just something that the last few days have really been on my mind and stressing me out and I've been getting really anxious about."

"I really do appreciate it. Yes, I've been praying to God and have a whole army of Saints the past year+ praying for me. There has been progress on that front... she opened up, we talked, got to know each other better, and finally met in person(that was interesting in itself). After meeting in person and admitting my feelings, poof .. 

I have still been praying in this time.. I plan to say something to her tomorrow to let her know that I feel silly/foolish and will have to cancel our chat I wanted Sunday... But i will still be here for her and i want to remind her not to hesitate if she ever needs anything if she decides to. As you said, in the end it is Gods will, and what will be will be. Can't say/do anymore than I have done.

I do appreciate your willingness to help and sharing your knowledge!

I also hope and pray for you for success in your life, friendships, relationships, and in your SA 🙏🏻🕯✨️"	ReadyAbbreviations63	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9991950392723083	weak	strong	no	na	socialanxiety
"You’re welcome to rant and if you need more space to rant you can shoot me a DM.

Honestly she doesn’t sound like she’s into you and it’s more of hopeful feeling you still have left.

Besides that, you’ll notice if someone truly fancies you. It will be a giving and receiving at the same time. Not a situation where you’ll have to be the giver 100% and never receive anything in return. Love can be so beautiful and it’s even more beautiful once you see someone else actually putting effort into you. Let this one go and you’ll see, someone will come along and it won’t seem like you have to work for it anymore. You’ll receive love without endless hours of effort put into it."
