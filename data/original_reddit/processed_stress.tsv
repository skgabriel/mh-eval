"every time I get excited about something - a deal, a job, a guy, an event, anything - it turns to shit. Can life really  be THIS hard?? I don't want a lot - just a kind honest partner, enoigh money to live without stress, and some peace and security.

Just some recent examples;

Had a neighbor accuse me of stealing her lost dog last week, called.the police and threatened theft charges against me

Had some buyers back out of a contract and a temp leaae on my flip house. Now they want ALLL.the rent money back or their threatening to sue me, saying they never moved in. They had their belongings in the home and.had.the KEYS!!!! (They think I lied about the foundation but I didn't know about any foundation problems)

Got stood up on my birthday by a guy I liked. I asked.him out for a beer, he said next Tuesday is good. I texted him Tuesday, he was busy but would text me when he's free. Nothing. Ever.

My dad thinks I'm a liar, I make excuses, and it's always my way or the highway.

Bought tickets to the Cure concert - the reseller never delivered my ticket. Had to go through hell to get a refund.


Constantly getting thrown under the bus by family and friends. And basically fucked up the ass by anyone and everyone.

Try so hard to make money but always struggling.

I'm 45 and feel like I'm still trying to figure it all out, build a life.  I'm single AF, broke, no savings or retirement, single mom and hating life. Freaking ground hog day - stress, chores and bills. That's it.

Read some journal pages from several years ago - the same then as it is now. I've tried meditating, positive affirmations, stones, prayer, essential oils, massage, fucking everything to change my energy, reality, subconscious programming, etc. Stuck.

"I think this is kind of average for a lot of people. Social media makes us want everyone else’s perfect lives. But, most people have ups and downs, at a minimum. 

It’s interesting about the journal and that you say all the things you’ve tried. 

You should feel good that you keep trying! You may think you’re not making progress but maybe you will.  And, maybe more of the good stuff is just around the corner.

In the mean time, I suggest being kind to yourself (even if others aren’t). Stop and have good moments in your day and start noticing everything that is positive and good. It may be seeing a butterfly, smelling a flower, rocking out to a fun song, or receiving a smile from a stranger. 

Focus on that and believe that the other stuff will probably fall away or improve.

What brings you joy? Make that a priority. And see what happens.

That is something I am working on as well.

I’ve had anxiety attacks in the past and going for walks outside has helped me tons. It was my main way to calm myself down. 

Unfortunately I was in accident this summer, which I will recover from eventually but for now I cannot go for walks.

Hello everyone, so for 2 weeks I have been on constant stress.  I’m a huge sufferer of health anxiety. It seems like the stress has caused me to get stiff tense muscles on my neck and when I would lay down I would feel hot in my covers and get some slight chills and when I would check my temperature I’m perfectly fine.

"Ah, I see… Someone suggested incorporating pranayama into your morning routine. Well, they couldn't be more right! Pranayama can truly work wonders in helping you find a sense of calm and balance amidst the work-home stress.  
  
  
Pranayama techniques involve controlled breathing, which activates the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to a relaxation response. This can significantly reduce stress levels and promote a sense of inner peace. Regular pranayama practice also oxygenates the brain and enhances blood circulation, leading to improved mental clarity, focus, and concentration throughout the day.  
  
  
To help you get started with your pranayama routine, I highly recommend reading this blog from Alpesh Yoga. It will walk you through the steps of [setting up a morning pranayama practice](https://alpeshyoga.com/setting-up-a-morning-pranayama-routine-tips-to-consider).

I’ve had some stress and anxiety issues for a couple months now and I’ve a couple health issues during this time. I’ve been getting headaches on and off throughout the day especially after workouts, after I eat I have bad burping, I also feel tired a lot, and just had random sort discomforts in all random parts of my body. Is this something other experience?	Dangerous_Ad1029	post	33.69929683847715	male	White	0.9963149428367615	na	na	na	2	stress

"I drove home from an appointment today, and randomly stopped in the road. I don’t know if I saw a stop sign, or a red light. But I just stopped with a line of cars behind me. I did end up realizing that there was no stop sign or light. I just slowed down and stopped. Zoned out can’t explain a full stop. Idk if I saw something or not.

I’m just really stressed out. I’m majorly in debt; I’ve been on Fmla since march, my time has ran out; I don’t want to go back to that job; I’ve been trying to find a new job since I started Fmla, just no one is giving me a chance; I’m in a stalemate with my finances. Already warned if I go back, they are looking to garnish my checks. Luckily the company has changed while I have been out so I don’t think they can get a hold of them. 

My relationship sucks. I’m a burden, constantly depressed; every time I see a light, someone shoots it down. Like a job opportunity that never goes through. I’m dragging my man down. He’s exhausted of dealing with my emotions and taking care of me. I’m not even sure if I love him anymore. Or if he is just all I have. My family is tired of hearing about it. They have their own issues and nothing proves to help me. I’m stuck. I have no where to go; and I think he plans on leaving me behind when our lease is up.

Lately my mind just goes other places. I’ll sit on the toilet and watch my shower curtain twirl, like I see the designs wave idk. I took my adderal today and then I do that while driving. I have no clue what to do. My doctor just provides meds and no solutions. I have no idea why I came to a complete stop. And I’m pretty sure someone called my car out on a local fb page. I know it was bizarre"	IllOpportunity89	post	37.15190034580186	female	White	0.9987490177154541	na	na	na	2	stress
"I've been dealing with chronic stress and anxiety myself. I also have ADHD. I've done things like this in the past. Just stop my car randomly. It's kind of like a blank out where your brain skips a beat and you just stop the car because you were confused for a second. 

Stress does weird shit to your mind. 

If your doctor is not listening, get a new one. Part of their job is to hear you out and try to provide solutions based on your individualized needs. My psychiatrist was like this, and now I dropped them. 

You HAVE to eliminate stress wherever you can. It may seem like an impossibility, but you've gotta make it happen for your well being. Because stress isn't something that you can just shake off one day and be fine after a few weeks. It takes years to recover from chronic stress, so you have to start now."

"I dont know what to do. I feel so fucking trapped and its my own fault because I tried. This is what happens when I try, I only fuck myself over more. I worked almost non stop all of the first part of the year before I broke my ankle. I also was dealing with shitty finances and feeling like trash from my miscarriage and break up the year before. I know I took st pattys day off and then my birthday, but thats it. And my birthday basically ended up being trash (whats new there) because I broke my ankle. The day of my birthday. Before we even had fun. So I got my hopes up for being relaxed and comfortable for nothing. Then I got to spend the two weeks after that in pain and doing nothing but phone calls and paperwork for medicaid, DHS, and job applications/my resume. Then surgery which was painful and annoying. Then non stop certification classes. Then non stop training. Now non stop working at a new job, about to go back to my old one soon on top of that. I still dont have enough money to fix my hospital debt and rising debt from no income for 2ish months. All of my free time outside of working is about everyone else. Birthday parties, family bullshit, trips for long lengths (not vacations mind you, family reunions and ruined weekends over and over) just to come back and get NO MORE TIME OFF until who fucking knows when.  And I don’t even *just* get to do all of this shit, oh no, I also have to take care of the dog, home alone, with a broken ankle and a walker, along with trying to juggle my very struggling mental health. “Oh but keep you’re head up.” “I/we are so proud of you.” “You seem so happy with the changes.” Jesus fucking christ. None of you are ever happy until I am on the verge of breaking down. I have to want to die for any of you to give me praise. I have made a little over $500 for 2.5 months worth of work for this new job. Not enough money, gotta keep at it!!! Fuck you. When do I get a day to myself??? HUH? A full goddamn day to do something *I* want??!!!??!! Or at least not have to work at all for one day. Anyone know? Please help me the fuck out? No? You’re so proud though, and I seemed so excited? Please. I was trying as hard as I could to make everyone leave me alone and stop telling me everything I “should” do. And its STILL brought me nothing but exhaustion and being backed into a corner until I can’t fucking take anymore. I should have just waited to go back to my old job after surgery. Used the two months to recoup and get my head straight. But everyone was telling me I needed to “change my line of work” and “do something” not just sit here. I can’t live up to these expectations. Being around every single one of you exhausts me. And I hate it. But when will the path of “get better” ever just be “you’ve done enough”?  Probably not until I die or you all do. I hate this planet. And now I will probably just end up in the psychiatric ward, for the 5th time in 3 years, because I don’t know how to make money, get past my PTSD, and keep everyone off of my back at the same time. All I want is to be free of my family that has abused me for years and caused me guilt and shame after the fact, while also figuring my shit out so *I* am happy. 

P.S.- For clarification, my new job is sales based, but I did not realize I wouldnt make an hourly during training. Its a totally new line of work for me and I thought I would “try something new”. Its not what I wanted or expected but none of my friends or family want me to leave even thought I havent made over $600 in all of that time and not gotten a single day off. Before that I worked 45-55 hours a week at my previous job to try and make ends meet. Now, I basically have to do both because I STILL cannot stabilize my finances and everyone is giving me shit about not trying longer at this new job. Which literally makes no sense to me."	popajoy420	post	26.457082944673292	male	White	0.9992945194244385	na	na	na	1	stress
This may not be your cup of tea, but working as a lab assistant for a clinical lab probably pays better than the jobs you’ve had and many sites will train you.

Long time no see. This is just another r/Stress post.

I want to die. I find it EXTREMELY hard to find motivation to do anything. I feel like it’s all pointless. My life is good, ive got everything i need so im not sure why i even feel this way. I do take meds, sertraline. They have worked, they still work sorta. I used to be happy, now im empty and find it hard to care about anything.

"Hi all,  
I won't go too deep into my story, but I've been chronically stressed and anxious most of my life, and I suspect a big part of this has to do with an overactive sympathetic nervous system due to some childhood experiences.  
I have come a long ways through meditation, breath work, therapy, etc, but there is still a feeling of ""something not quite right"". I've been seeing these ""nervous system retraining"" programs being advertised (Re-Origin, Gupta, Nervous System Solution, etc), and they seem to describe exactly what I deal with.  
Does anyone have experience with one of these programs, and did it help you reduce anxiety and chronic stress long-term? There is something about them that screams scam, but at the same time I am intrigued. One red flag is that they always want hundreds of dollars to teach you these ""science-backed techniques"".  
I'd love input on these programs! I'm at a point where I'm looking for more permanent solutions. I don't expect miracles or that I'll ever be perfect, just looking to finally unravel some old patterns for good,  
Thanks all!  
TL:DR has anyone tried a nervous system retraining program? Are they a scam?"	L33_0h	post	21.98780512038891	male	White	0.016850655898451805	na	na	na	1	stress

"These are just my poorly written notes from Dr. Huberman's podcast on stress management and notes from a therapist

Physiological sigh - breathe, we do this before we sleep
When diaphragm expands, the heart expands, and blood flow slows
Exhale longer or more vigorously than your inhales


2. Do a double inhale (thru nose) and long exhale (mouth) (2-3x)
Rids body of CO2
You don't want your heart rate to drop too fast
Takes 20-30s


3. Look at 5 separate objects. Think about each one for a short while.
Listen for 4 distinct sounds. Think about where they came from and what sets them apart.
Touch 3 objects. Consider their texture, temperature, and what their uses are.
Identify 2 different smells. This could be the smell of your coffee, your soap, or the laundry detergent on your clothes.
Name 1 thing you can taste. Notice whatever taste is in your mouth, or try tasting a piece of candy.

Take a warm shower / splash your face with warm water.

[Dr. Huberman podcast](https://youtu.be/ntfcfJ28eiU)

Look up other Grounding techniques, try meditation, tea if the caffeine won't make you worse contains L-theanine as mentioned in Dr. Huberman's podcast.

Go for a walk if you can, looking at the blue sky and green plants can also help you relax.

Talk to a therapist or someone about how you're feeling. Think about what you can control and what you cannot and try not to stress about the things you cannot control or change and think about what you can do at this moment in time.

I’m experiencing the same thing and it sucks! I’ve had poor mental health and extreme anxiety my whole life and had a burnout and now stuck with 24/7 dizziness/vertigo. I’m just tryna find ways to calm my nervous system cuz I’ve been told ur body thinks ur in a constant “fight or flight” state so ur dizzy all the time. Being in nature has helped me, plus coming off medications that worsened it, plus adding herbs that target stress like cbd oil, St. John’s wort, magnesium and GABA. Just try relax, be ok with not knowing why or when it will stop, accept it for now, and know it will go away eventually. we just gotta use this time to reset and heal the nervous system.

I asked my dentist for a single-pill prescription for Xanax prior to an uncomfortable procedure, and she was willing to prescribe it. However, she said I'd have to get a ride or take an Uber because of the sedating effects. Maybe your dentist can do that? Or can they give you a little laughing gas once you're in the chair?

"Hey guys, for about the past 2 and a half months I've been dealing with the strange health issues I've ever experienced. I've gotten checked by multiple doctors and they all say stress but I'm not sure. I know I have severe health anxiety so I've gone and convinced myself multiple times that I have some terrible illness. But these symptoms are just so unlike anything I've ever had before.

- I got dizzy and blacked out last month
- brain fog
- when I closed my eyes I got vertigo
- constant fatigue
- no appetite last month
- crazy appetite this month
- constant diaherra and really bad gut issues
- tension headaches
- weakness and sometimes pain in my limbs
- chest usually feels weird
- I dont have trouble breathing but it feels like there's a weight in my chest
- heart beats super fast very frequently
- my body falls apart really fast like I'll be sorta okay and then suddenly everything is terrible
- I'm exhausted but never actually tired
- increased panic attacks and anxiety because of all this

Does this sound like chronic stress to you guys? It probably is but my health anxiety is absolutely tearing me apart and I can't convince myself otherwise. What do you guys think?

This is like the worst I've ever felt before."	Silently_Salty	post	22.75934119488639	male	White	0.9981016516685486	na	na	na	13	stress
"unfortunately yes, chronic stress can absolutely cause these symptoms. 

if you have access to/funding for a functional medicine doc, they might be able to pinpoint some systemic issues that exacerbate your stress and could be causing your symptoms (things like poor gut health, hormonal imbalances, etc.). but even without addressing those, you might see real improvement from things like yoga, meditation/mindfulness, or other de-stressing techniques like vagus nerve exercises, or something creative and enjoyable (like drawing, coloring, writing, even watching shows you really like or playing really fun games). journalling can also be helpful. 

it may sound whacky but I'm learning this the hard way myself. I've seen countless doctors (including functional medicine) and the biggest improvements I've seen so far have come from rest, enjoyment (doing things that make me happy/relaxed) and mindfulness."

"Sorry to hear you are dealing with this.

A lot of your symptoms I experienced when I was suffering from chronic stress. 

I was lost in all the different physical issues stress can cause. 

I was in this state for a long time. Too long now, looking back.

The fact that you've been checked out is excellent. 

I bounced from doctor to doctor, naturopath to naturopath, and a few charletens along the way. 

The main issues is your nervous system is sympathetic dominant, basically meaning your constantly in feat mode.

When we are in this state for too long our stress becomes chronic. 

Start with lots of relaxation. LOTS. 

Prioritize sleep.

This sounds like what I’ve been through.  I’m still on the end of recovering but I get side effects like yourself of can’t concentrate, brain fog, random urges of dread or anxiety, appetite fluctuates, fatigue. I’ve had a lot go on in my life recently, and I think it’s because of that. I am like yourself though and I can’t pin the reason so far. It’s immensely frustrating.

"Yes this can absolutely be stress, and solving it isn’t some thing a doctor can do for you. Stress related issues can be resolved by learning to work with what’s going on in your mind and body. Identifying stressors is helpful but it’s more about how we’re relating to those things. 

For example, if you feel your heart rate, go up and assume “this must mean I’m dying” you’re going to get very anxious. Your heart rate will probably go up more. You’ll have a harder time calming down. 

But if you feel your heart rate goes up and you think “this means I’m stressed and can take some deep breaths to calm down” you’re going to behave very differently. 

Being told to “relax” never worked for me. My brain did not know how to do that 😂

I went through this a few months ago. Was constantly sick, having panic attacks and in a lot of physical pain that doctors couldn’t explain. You need to look for the root of where most of your stress comes from. For me, it was a job that made me extremely miserable. After quitting, pretty much all of my health problems went away. There will always be things that stress you out throughout life, but eliminating the bigger ones that bother your the most will feel like a weight off your chest, and you’ll be able to handle the smaller stressors with more ease.

"I second this 2000 percent. 

I have been dealing with the fallout from chronic stress and anxiety. It destroyed me. Most of the symptoms that OP mentioned I had and then some. 

Relaxation and mindfulness are huge. 

Getting outside and moving your body are also huge. 

Eating right and sleeping right are also huge. 

Using your brain for things that aren't related to your stressors/anxiety. 

Finding a therapist would be beneficial. 

OP, identify your stressors and try to eliminate them as best you can. This is the only real way to tackle it to start. You can't bubble bath and yoga your way out of chronic stress if you don't eliminate or mitigate the stressor to begin with at the root."

"Okay, I'm just going to sit down and write how I'm feeling. 
I don’t know if the way I feel is valid. For starters, I get extremely attached to people really fast and I get hurt really easily. I have anger issues and I don’t like being alone. I’d like to say I'm not an attention whore but I think I am? 

I (M,20) don’t have many friends online or irl but I am an extremely nice person. I give a lot and I forgive a lot and people take advantage of me and I never really notice until it's too late. I always give people too many chances as well, thinking that they’re going to have a change of heart. I get upset when people arent straight forward with me and expect me to read their minds. Although I'm not the fastest to catch on when I do make mistakes, once I find out I always try my best to fix it. Also, as said earlier, I’m no saint. I easily get upset and I can understand why that would make people not want to be my friend. I understand that I have hurt people and that some people may be uncomfortable with me, which I totally understand. I don't blame them. The only thing that makes me upset however, is if I didn't mean to upset someone and they won't tell me what I did. Therefore I cant fix the problem. I always want to be a problem solver because I hate drama despite me finding myself in it constantly and that's due to my own choice. I can't seem to avoid it. I guess I get too comfortable with people too easily?  I was told last year by someone I sacrificed my sleep and mental health for that ""I'm not allowed to feel certain ways because the ways I feel are not valid and I'm just being manipulative.""  I don't think me being upset over being used for sex and not because I thought they wanted a relationship is me being manipulative but whatever I guess. At work I think I finally found some friends but when I try to hang out with them, they either always flake at the last second or just simply don't reply or just don't seem interested which is fine but like I'd like to be told at least or something idk. I'll think we're fine just to find out they unfollowed me a long ass time ago and act like I don't exist. I don't get it. I check in on people daily and ask how they're doing, I ask them if they did anything productive today. I wish I got the same shit back. I talk about how I'm going to treat people how they treat me but then I'm the villain for getting revenge. I'm aware that revenge is a fool's game but why am I not allowed to treat people the same way they treat me? It makes no sense to me and it doesn't seem fair. But if I complain about that no one says shit. I try to show myself off to people (not in that way) but in a personality type of way, I want to throw myself out there in the world. I want to be interesting to people and I want people to enjoy me for me but I feel like people don't enjoy me for me and always want me to do something. So my dumbass goes ahead and changes myself to be accepted but then when I change, suddenly I'm not liked so I change again and change again and change again trying to become the perfect person for these people who literally don't care about me. And as much as I know they don't care about me, I can't let them go because I hate the feeling of being alone despite me already being alone. The friends that I do have irl, and online are all busy with lives and I know that I have a life too and that I shouldn't just focus on friends and social media and video games and shit. I try and try and try to get people to join me but no one wants to do shit. People are lazy and that's fine but idk. I just want to feel important and valued. I'm so tired of people not being honest with me."	HeldYouCloseToMe	post	19.81155167194782	female	White	0.9942670464515686	na	na	na	3	stress

"Okay. Well, in that case, it sounds like you're too focused on what you can get from other people. It seems to me like you're expecting things. You gotta let that go. 

Also, you mention how people sidle away from you when you change for them. I can clearly see why they do. You have a misguided sense of identity, and people pick up on that quickly. People don't want you to change who you are in order to please them. That's very obvious and generally off-putting. People will feel most comfortable when you're just being yourself. But first you have to accept you for you. 

Your essay rings of expected reciprocity. This is not the way. You cannot have expectations. This will lead you down a dark path. Remember when interacting with others, other people, and yourself are perfectly entitled to feel how they feel. If you're being nice to someone, then they are not obligated to be nice back. As long as they are respectful to you, then they are doing nothing wrong. You need to save your energy for the people that matter. Trying to be nice to people in all of these ways that you mention is great, but it has to come from an honest place that's rooted in your true self. Expect nothing in return. There are very few people in everyone's lives that you can interact on that level with and reap what you sow. 

Basically, all I'm saying is that it sounds like you're searching for connection, genuinely, but are a bit wayward in your approach. You need to take some of that energy that you're extending to other people and extend it to yourself. Love yourself and make YOU a better person. If you love and respect YOU, then people will see that and want to be around YOU. But you can't do that with the chief objective of wanting to have friends or romantic partners.

"         I’m an 32 y/o American Flor’idiot and Perspective has been helping me when I feel this way. You’re young and entering an age I sometimes wish I was back at. I was at my prime when I was 18 and on top of the world. Now, I am not and stress has since callused and blinded me from seeing what I have attained. It blocks me. 

         Despite distances, circumstances and environments…I believe no matter what and where you are, realizing you’re not alone dealing with stress can foster a sense of gratification. Even if it’s a small bit. It helps make things just a tad brighter which can help guide you in making small changes. It’s our prime directive to survive and we live in a stress saturated world that is relentless in dishing out stress. Foster gratitude. 

           Once you feel like you have everything under control and you’re doing the best you can, nature and people prove you wrong and the cycle repeats itself. Find balance between things we can and cannot control. And seeing those things for what they are. Take control of what you can and accept what you can’t and let it build resolve. 

           You will always have your SELF, always. You’re stronger than you think but don’t let your own shadow get in the way or shut you down.

"I’m so sorry about all the stress you’re experiencing!

Prozac can cause side effects that include insomnia and worsened anxiety during the first few weeks of taking it. 

1) I suggest you definitely call the doctor in the morning and let them know you’re experiencing side effects. 

If your doctor is just a General Practioner, you may want to go to a psychiatrist who is much more well versed in prescribing anti anxiety medicines.

2) I would start seeing a therapist right away also, even if it’s just a virtual or texting session. They can help you with new perspectives, ideas for dealing with things, and just act as a sounding board so you can vent. If money is tight, you can often find people who will work on a sliding scale, meaning you can pay a smaller amount than most people.

For tonight, don’t think about how you want to sleep but you can’t. Just decide that maybe it’s a nice night to watch a movie or two. Distract yourself with a movie or a book to relax.

You may as well call the old therapist and attempt a new appointment. Maybe she’ll be understanding. And if she’s not, that’s her right, but definitely find someone else.

Well, if I understand you correctly than this sounds like sort of a dead end street. Like it's only a matter of time before this strategy stops functioning. You haven't mentioned many details but I can relate to this a lot... Unfortunately the truth is that most likely only we ourselves can make a change. And if we don't take care, then sooner or later it's very possible that our body/mind will simply say no and collapse. I've been there before. Did I learn form it? Maybe a bit yes. But do I have a solution... Not so much. It's also a matter of priorities and we often put our own happiness and self importance behind anything else. Changing it requires a lot of work and time. But the reward is very great and long lasting.	chelamander	reply	na	na	na	0.9980529546737671	weak	no	no	na	stress
"Hi all! 

So a little backstory here, about ten years ago I was diagnosed with general anxiety /depression and have managed well with Medication and living a health lifestyle however over the past few months I’ve had some stressors (building a house, planning a wedding/getting married, parenting a 2 year old, and some career changes that have led me to taking on more responsibilities at work) I seemed to be managing fine always on the go, and had hope that things would slow down a bit after the wedding and moving into a new house) but shortly after some of the events came to a close I’ve started noticing varying symptoms of depression creeping in, extreme fatigue, unexpected weight gain, hair loss, brittle nails, higher blood pressure numbers (fyi I have been diagnosed with hypertension a year ago and am under the age of 30), I inquired about getting my thyroid check with my dr however since I had blood work done 6 months ago he said there was no need to do more because the results wouldn’t change in six months. He said all these symptoms are related to me stress, So he decided to up my dosage of antidepressants, but then he noticed that the meds (Effexor)  I was on are known to raise blood pressure so instead we are slowly tapering off of them  and on to a new one, in the mean time I have increased my physical activity, started talk therapy and made more of a point to take care of myself, but I still feel terrible with little energy or desire to do anything, work continues to be a driving force for my stress and anxiety, I am a young female who manages 25 people in a predominantly male career and my workload has become increasingly larger, my therapist mentioned taking time off work on one hand it makes perfect sense to me to take time off but on the other I feel like that is a quitters way out and I would be a failure as a manager if I needed to take time off. At what point did you know it was time for stress leave? I honestly don’t know what I need more right now, a sense of accomplishment in my career or a break for my body?

I realized I didn’t want to be like her and I didn’t want to carry the family legacy of working until you’re down to the bone, and then keep working or else. That’s not how I want to live life and I’m fortunate that that’s not how I have to live life (I get compensated while on my break, free mental health services, etc. due to a workplace trauma).

"I am not in your shoes, but I would do the following:

1. If possible, Uber kids to and from their activities without you. I am considering it myself for an after-school activity when the bus is gone. If Uber is out of the budget, I would find other parents, relatives, neighbors.
2. When you are on the road with your older girls, consider using that time to unwind and relax. Maybe listen to your favorite music, an audiobook, or even a podcast that brings you joy.
3. I would make sure to carve out some ""me-time"" amidst the busyness. Even if it's just a few minutes each day to do something I love, it can make a big difference in reducing stress. If possible any relaxation session: massage, bath, meditation, etc. Perhaps even short meditation like that: [https://youtu.be/CH9IiWZC8BU](https://youtu.be/CH9IiWZC8BU)
4. I always make sure to communicate openly with my husband about how I am feeling. Sharing your thoughts and concerns can bring you both closer and provide much-needed support.

"I have a family history of dementia on my dad's side. Though, it seems it was largely stress induced (which i mean, makes some sense). My grandpa (95) is very far gone into dementia- had multiple strokes in his life and ptsd from ww2 + generally a rough life. His brother, whos even older (96), is in amazing condition and was still driving himself around and doing work around the house until about half a year ago. He is still very sharp and aware. My dad was a heavy alcoholic and abused prescriptions, and very obviously has nerve and brain damage from years of doing this. I have also watched my mom work herself half to death and family drama of both sides has been absolutely insane over the years.

The effects of chronic stress are evident in most my family members, both physically and mentally. I want to learn better stress management skills and avoid such health issues and mental deterioration as I can helpm But it's hard.

I have somewhat lofty goals. With school- Im an undergrad getting 2 majors and a minor + working on a research project that will be published im so excited like what??!). I am in my senior year now. Im hoping to go to grad school and pursuing a masters or ohd in linguistics. Im also working during this time. I travel semi often (currently studying abroad). Money does cause stress and Im working on dealijg with some very very old trauma and a resulting pain condition (if youre wondering, i made this acct for discovering said conditions and u can look at my post hist i guess). I also have a lot of hobbies but only really do art at the moment. I had a small issue with drinking that I recently nipped in the bud. I try to work out and eat better more oftwn but I just feel so burned out so often that i dont often do so (its been slowly getting a lil better tho!). I have a pretty bad sleep schedule thats been hard to fix.

I have some anxiety, moderate ocd, and pretty bad perfectionism.

I'm not sure how much of this is paranoia vs actual things I'm noticing, but I think I'm beginning to reach the point where stress might have long term effects on ny health.

Ive always had a bad social memory but I feel like my memory generally has been getting worse lately. This last winter and spring, I averaged like 6 hours of sleep a night and was living off of energy drinks (i try to get 0 sugar always, but i know thats not exactly healthy- its just bad in a slightly diff way...). I started getting mild heart palpations (which ive been more prone to every since o got them a lot during a hiiighly steessful period in high school). I was at work one day, after finally presenting a large project at my uni's synposium of undergrad reaearch, and I felt like I couldnt breathe randomly. I waited it out, and it lasted like an hr. It was kinda scary. I probably should have brought it up or sought some kind of medical attention but I didnt. Since then, I've tried to cut way down on caffine.

I have had a relatively stressful childhood, teenhood, and now young adulthood. I havent had a real break since starting college, as even in summers I end up travelling a lot and/or also doing summer classes.

I have been hella burned out a whilw now.

I want to find ways to manage stress better while also not giving up my goals. I want to still travel. I want my 2 degrees (and Im super close to having both anyways now). I want to do this project bc im so passionate about it. And i want to still have fun and do my hobbies.

Its just... so much sometimes.

I understand that you dont want to be unemployed but you said that you dont really need the money. So you are not financially dependant ... Not yet at least. It could be more complicated if you were.

It's my opinion but you should try to understand the reasons of why this work causes you massives stress.
Your physical symptoms (chest palpitations and stomach pain) warn you that you are not okay in this environment unlike what you say.

"Your breath can help you in these trying times

Your breath is the doorway to your nervous system, and your ability to consciously control your breath is the key to that door.

I know it sounds so obvious, easy, and cliche, but the world inside your breathing is amazing.

How we breathe dictates how we live.

I used to be chronically stressed and anxious about everything.

I initially came across using breathing after having chronic stress and anxiety. I'd tried everything, but everything changed when I learned about how we develop dysfunctional breathing.

Dysfunctional breathing patterns created by stress and anxiety can develop a vicious cycle . This is where...

1.	⁠⁠""a stressor"" causes changes to your breathing patterns
2.	⁠⁠changes to your breathing patterns sends signals to your brain
3.	⁠⁠these signals cause stress & anxiety
4.	⁠⁠anxiety causes further changes to your breathing mechanics
5.	⁠⁠further changes to your breathing mechanics cause more symptoms.. and the cycle continues.

Retraining my breathing had such a profound effect on my life I quit my job and made it my life.

Two pieces of advice:

1.	⁠⁠Be aware of your breathing when you feel stressed. Are you using your mouth? Your nose? Are you breathing fast? Shallow? Where are you breathing from?
2.	⁠⁠When you feel stressed, close your mouth, use your nose, and breathe slow, low, expansive, and controlled.

"I run a business, and since three months ago, I have been diagnosed with moderately severe situational depression stemming from chronic burnout over a few years, marked by hopelessness, helplessness and emptiness, dissociation, psychosomatism (palpitations, tremors, hyperventilations), and suicidal thoughts. Also, I've been clinically diagnosed with trauma, which manifests in immense anxiety on anything/anyone related to work, which means I still can't open/reply email, or have any discussion on work at all. Fast forward three months, I've been ruminating whether I made the right sequences of choices:

1. For a month after the onset of my depression, I was still working, albeit less productive (approx 75% of my regular productivity). I shared about my condition to my business partner, and asked him to cover on some key business tasks.
2. After the first month, because my condition was deteriorating, I decided to take a month off, and my business partner would continue to lead the company.
3. After my one month of leave, I haven't felt better (and in fact, some symptoms continue to deteriorate, and my score on depression scale went up again). Hence, I decided to extend my leave by one additional month. As per the first month of leave, I didn't worry about taking the break because I trusted my business partner to lead and handle everything. During the two months off, I went completely offline, mostly about the worsening anxiety and trauma, and its manifestation in passive suicidal thoughts and physical symptoms.

In the last couple of months I was away, some things at work had not gone as per planned due to my absence, and as a result, the company had to let some employees go, and there is a chance we might have to shut down. I thought my business partner would be able to keep things afloat and move things forward, but unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case in the last two months.  
In the last few days, I've been feeling guilt for taking the time off, but at the time it was something I desperately needed, because I was struggling so bad. What would you have done if you were me?"	throwaway-78285	post	29.332999705363925	female	White	0.9950430393218994	na	na	na	2	stress
"Well, lets step back and think for a moment. Your health was rapidly deteriorating. You took some time to get better, which is absolutely valid. Maybe there was some unforeseen risk leaving your job to someone else, but you can’t pour from an empty cup. Let’s assume your business partner did their best given the circumstances. Now you are back, and things aren’t ideal, but now that you are back, what can you do to improve your situation? Ruminating on what decisions you could have or should have made doesn’t fix anything, and may make your health worse. Try to focus on what you can do now. Are you going to choose to try to bring your business back to good standing? Are you willing to try to repair the situation? Or are you unwilling to? The past is the past, and your health is first at the end of the day (can’t do anything if you’re not around because you didn’t take care of yourself). What can you do NOW that can help the situation (yourself AND the business)? Remember to do something even if it’s just one thing a day, for yourself.

I would also not blame the business being in a bad spot on your health. Someone else was supposed to step up and handle things while you took some much needed time to get better. Not your fault they couldn’t run things as you maybe had anticipated they could. They probably should have said something when things started going south, or if they were unsure they could cover for the time you would be OOO. Bad news fast, you know. If anything, we can learn that a way to contact you in case of emergency (and training on what constitutes an actual emergency) would potentially be useful in the event you need to step away in the future. Otherwise spreading out the jobs to more than one person may help too. No reason to blame and shame yourself. How you choose to react now to the situation at hand will determine the outcome in the future. From an outsiders perspective, I would make sure you continue to prioritize your health every day and take business things one step at a time. I wish you good luck and have faith you can get through this.🍀 Remember, your health is very important, you can’t pour from an empty cup, and you can do anything you set your mind to! You built up your business once, I see no reason you can’t do it again. Might not be on the most ideal quick timeline as possible, but that’s okay. Shit happens. That is life. How you choose to move forward now is what’s important.	throwaway-78285	reply	na	na	na	0.9950430393218994	weak	no	no	na	stress
"Currently working on four huge manuscripts for submission early August and one 20 minute presentation that I'm getting ready to share next week. I have also a lot of little tasks that take less brain power, but are probably about 1-2 hrs worth of labor. If I don't write them down, I simply won't get to the little tasks.

How do you organize the day so you don't burn out by 2 pm if you start at 6:30 - 7:00 am? I really need the endurance.

* I take a lunch break at around 11:00-11:30 am.
* I take a break from 2:30 to 5:30 pm to run errands, make phone calls, deal with health issues, do PT exercises/workout, and then I resume at around  after 6:00 until 8:00 - 8:30 pm. My evening tasks are generally lighter, but I feel like it's too much lately? Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. When I was in the food industry, I worked all day with no breaks. 
* I am most productive between 8 am to 1:00 pm. My endurance fizzles out at 1:30, 2:00

"1. Please allow yourself time to heal. If you cannot rest entirely, remember that taking small breaks is fine in the grand scheme. It's a little reward. Do something that makes you feel rewarded after you complete a task. 

2. Make lists. Write every little thing down. Need to shower? Write it down! Need to eat? Write it down! If need be, put it in your phone and set reminders. 

3. Time yourself doing the tasks. See how long they actually take. You might not need as much time as you need to get certain things done. This has helped me deal with becoming overwhelmed by having many tasks going at once.

"Just see what happens. You may be more well-liked than you think. Stress and anxiety tends to make us always assume the worst in every scenario, it's literally evolutionarily designed to do that, in order to get us the fuck out of dodge in times of trouble. But it doesn't really serve us in the everyday, and really messes with your head long-term. 

People can be a lot more compassionate than we give them credit for. If you explain your situation and that your mental health has been a struggle, a good person would do what they could to help you. Hell, sometimes even a shitty person can be kind. 

It's not the end of the world. It may seem that way, due to mental struggles. But you always have to remember that your PERCEPTION is doing its best to INTERPRET your reality. Sometimes it does a really poor job and makes things seem worse than they actually are. You CAN get a new job if things aren't working out. If that means taking a pay cut for the short term, then that's how it has to be. Some of my friends have had to bail from their dream jobs because of stress. They worked a job that would allow them to heal mentally for a few years or two, and then got back into their passion once they had the mental fortitude to approach it in a healthy way again, and are succeeding."		reply	na	na	na	0.9994997978210449	no	strong	no	na	stress

 painful but very tight and uncomfortable.

\-Both ears blocked and sore (almost constantly)

Thers a good chance thats stress. I get the majority of what your explaining. Dizziness is a common stress symptom. Random pains in head and stomach are common too. I get burning sensations, muscle spasms. On top of what your explaining. Shortness of breath is common. Feeling like your dying in and of itself is a symptom.

I'm not a doctor, but it sounds like you're describing some possible symptoms of stress or anxiety. Stress can manifest in various physical and psychological ways, and many of the symptoms you mentioned are commonly associated with high levels of stress.

Going off of what you’re saying in terms of clear tests and labs, then yes, those are all symptoms of stress and anxiety. The past two months I’ve experienced just about everything you listed. The body’s fight or flight response works wonders. Muscle tension, gastro issues, dizziness, brain fog. I’ve experienced all those. A lot also has to do with hyper awareness of said symptoms as well.

"Sounds like a lot of what I experienced.

Your nervous system is just overloaded.

Your breath can help you in these trying times

Your breath is the doorway to your nervous system, and your ability to consciously control your breath is the key to that door.

I know it sounds so obvious, easy, and cliche, but the world inside your breathing is amazing.

How we breathe dictates how we live.

I used to be chronically stressed and anxious about everything.

I initially came across using breathing after having chronic stress and anxiety. I'd tried everything, but everything changed when I learned about how we develop dysfunctional breathing.

Dysfunctional breathing patterns created by stress and anxiety can develop a vicious cycle . This is where...

1.	⁠⁠""a stressor"" causes changes to your breathing patterns
2.	⁠⁠changes to your breathing patterns sends signals to your brain
3.	⁠⁠these signals cause stress & anxiety
4.	⁠⁠anxiety causes further changes to your breathing mechanics
5.	⁠⁠further changes to your breathing mechanics cause more symptoms.. and the cycle continues.

Retraining my breathing had such a profound effect on my life I quit my job and made it my life.

Two pieces of advice:

1.	⁠⁠Be aware of your breathing when you feel stressed. Are you using your mouth? Your nose? Are you breathing fast? Shallow? Where are you breathing from?
2.	⁠⁠When you feel stressed, close your mouth, use your nose, and breathe slow, low, expansive, and controlled.

"Yes....all of your symptoms in my opinion are from stress. I am a 61 yr old and have dealt with this for a long time. I have had so many ""symptoms"" I could go on forever. I also have been cleared by tests over and over. I get worked up and afraid of dying. I never died though.
You won't either. Your path forward should be to find what works to push through the feelings knowing they are just that (however real they feel in the moment)....find someone to talk to who can relate to your feelings. People including therapists and doctors and friends that do not experience this type of stress will not understand. Find someone who does. Talk it out....
I wish I could tell you it will be ok (and that you will be ok too), but you don't feel that now and that's all part of it.
However, you're smart and resourceful so you can find what you need to help you better than anyone else.

So around the end of the school year this girl started sitting by me and was really nice to me, by the things she did I kinda picked up that she was into me and got a big crush on her, looked forward to every class, but was too scared to ask her out. On the last day of class I had a great opportunity but I chickened out, I saw her on the last test day but again got way too scared. This was over a month ago. All summer I have been stressing about this and it’s been ruining my mental health. Since the last day me and hee used to snap every day (twice I would get left on delivered for 3 days) but since the 3rd of July I have been on delivered now. I knew she was leaving for a vacation and got back the 4th, so I waited until then to start going to the mall (she works at a store there) and if I saw her we could catch up and I would ask her out. This didn’t happen and I just decided to break the ice by sending her a text relating to something we talked about in art, she responded like super bubbly and funny, just like she was talking to me in class. I sent a text saying I was going mini golfing Tuesday and said do you wanna come with to her, she said she’s going out of town monday but to have fun. I responded with “okay u too maybe some other time?” And for 2 days have been on delivered. 

I keep thinking about the last three weeks of school when we would talk, I just wish I did something different, I would relive the last 8 months of my life just so I could get back to late May-early June and do something different. I’ve never had a girl act like that to me and enjoyed it so much, I was awkward almost all of the time but I just can’t get over our time together. I had hyped myself up so much to ask her out but ruined it. Even if I asked her online within the 1st week of summer it probably would have gone better. I had enjoyed seeing her in clsss so much and obsessed over it during the end of school I didn’t get to enjoy it like I normally would, rather obsessing over if she liked me or not. I don’t know if I fumbled really REALLY badly or she just never liked me. I romanticize everything that happened around that time but now it’s all attached to memories of her, like when I listened to one of my favorite albums (I first heard it around that time) I always think about her. I just wish I wasn’t scared. School ended 5 weeks ago and since then I have just been stressing wasting away, wishing me and her could go do fun activities. But no. I was too scared and lost my only opportunity and wasted all this time. I’m on the verge of tears typing this. I’m sorry for the rant I just need help and don’t know what to do. Thank you."

I struggled with the same thing for months before finding a solution that really helped me. I always came across some videos or posts that talked about dealing with procrastination, they went on how you should write down your plans, plan ahead, take little breaks, etc. I tried all of it and nothing helped, I would just end up giving up in the middle. However, than I decided to pack my day as much as I can, I signed up for extra classes and did some activities (art club, tennis) that helped me to lose all my free time, I know how harsh that sounds, but what I mean is that when I came from one class, I already had a pressure of a next upcoming class and just like that never had a break. In the middle of all these classes and activities I did all the homework I had. I found that I worked best under the pressure and that’s how I stopped procrastinating, I didn’t have enough free time to let myself relax too much. But doing so for a long period of time can cause burnout so always make sure to take break once in a while! Maybe it is quite toxic way but it worked for me.

"Hi mate Ive worked in IT for nearly ten years so I understand how stressful it can be at times

IT can be incredibly competitive which is good if you're at the top but harder for those who can't hack it

4 jobs in 7 months is a lot (assuming this is full time and not contracts). You need to understand that simply fulfilling a role to standard quality is not enough, exceed expectations and maximise business value so that you have more leverage with your employer 

This eventually means more responsibility/compensation/expertise

What helped me is consciously making stress management a top priority

Doing so meant I could work harder and more effectively and feel less tired

It takes sometime but after a few months you'll feel like a new man

I'd recommend:
- wim hof method breathing exercise
- cold water therapy
- exercise everyday
- prioritise sleep

I work in an engineering company and we’re horrifically understaffed. Not in a bragging way, I’m probably the best at my job out of the 10 others that do the same thing and if anyone is struggling I get dragged about to help, or cover everyone and I don’t get a choice - my managers tell other managers I’m available without even asking me or letting me know until I’m being dragged off. I’ve tried telling them I’m too busy with my own work which I have 2 lots of 6 tier racks full of jobs that need to be done. It’s causing me so much stress being pulled pillar to post and taking on all the extra jobs people can’t do because they weren’t trained correctly. I’m currently sat in the toilets crying because of it whilst everyone else is stood about chatting not even doing their jobs.

"Hi I'm sorry to hear what you are going through. 

I've been there I know what that feels like. 

I suffered burnout from chronic stress & anxiety form years.

First thing you have to do for burnout is get enough sleep. 

Rubbish breathing activities is what changed my life.

"""Is there any way to calm myself down other than rubbish breathing activities for it or crying over it?"" -  is like putting a bandage on a wound, or taking ibuprofen. Furthermore, even if you change this job, you will find yourself in the same situation until people change the way how you perceive work.   
  
To deal with the root cause is to address the way how you feel about ""should"", ""need"" and where is ""me"". Look where is the focus of your attention right now: ""Cover everyone"" because ""I don’t get a choice"". 

"" I’m available without even asking me or letting me know until I’m being dragged off. "" - this is about your ability to keep your gaze on your own plans and be able to express a healthy attitude, and concentrate on what is my future, where am I in all of that.   
  
To manage on your own, I would suggest some videos on stress reduction (for example, [https://youtu.be/9jN4XYCAhPE](https://youtu.be/9jN4XYCAhPE)). To address the root cause is to change the entire system of beliefs and focus so it changes your reactions and behavior."	beamerboo-118	reply	na	na	na	0.9993047714233398	no	no	no	na	stress

"hey friend, 

I'm so sorry you're going through this. I myself ended up in a stress loop today that I had to break with anxiety meds. I've exhausted myself but now I have wicked acid reflux so I'm up late typing this. you're not alone, stress is so real. 

the goal here is to break this cycle. I don't know what triggered it, but if you can get some space from whatever triggered it, including visualizing putting it in a safe box somewhere, that can be a good start. 

next you can try some things to shock your system and expel energy i.e. cold exposure, vigorous exercise, intentionally crying about the thing you are upset about and holding and soothing yourself. 

if none of those work, definitely see if you can't get some crisis counselling. you don't have to go this alone ❤️"	Competitive_Net5818	reply	na	na	na	0.997491717338562	strong	strong	no	na	stress

"I’ve been stressed out from a very young age, because I always had the feeling that I needed to be perfect, so I would stress over anything I did, school, hobbies, how other’s perceive me, what I say. Up until junior and senior year of high school the stress and anxiety I got from talking to other people was so powerful that I just wouldn’t do it. If I did I would go home and overthink every single word, it was exhausting and to be honest these are the most vivid parts of my childhood and teenage years, the amount of stress I would feel. I tried to change when I went on to uni, the social anxiety part got better, not solved but better, and yet i found stress in everything else, especially after finding out my uni had rankings and that there would be benefits like better exchange programs etc. Then the pandemic and the war in Ukraine made it even worse (i’m from eastern europe very close to Ukraine) 

I’m tired of being stressed all the time, for the past 4 years I’ve seen physical effects of it as well. I had heart palpitations for a while, two years ago I started stress eating, i wake up feeling exhausted, I have episodes of nausea and headaches. I just want it to stop and everytime i think I’m on the right track it comes back stronger and I genuinely cannot see an end to this. A lot of it comes from self doubt and not feeling good enough. Does anyone have any tips on getting over this? I’m worried that if I go on like this I’ll see even worse physical effects in the future."	sddrdz	post	27.243068414752173	male	White	0.9954937696456909	na	na	na	6	stress

Stress is a physical reaction to the way how you perceive reality. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine are the current reality, I am originally from Belarus, and I get that. If you cannot get any help right now from a therapist (most likely to restore your sense of enough), I would start with mindfulness - your ability to be present in the moment.

"I am older, but I have experienced everything you talk about. From social anxiety to panic attacks without having any control over them. I am afraid of conflict and of being judged because I need to be perfect. I am a piano composer who no one hears. This is due to my rear of rejection failure, success?!?)  Each time I try to exploit my work to others my body is able to produce symptoms that I perceive as fatal illness..(cancer, heart attack etc.) There is no rationale for this as I check out ok at doctors with tests etc.....So I'm told I am ok, but the symptons are very real to me and I continue to be afraid of dying because I don't feel right (perfect). Others do not understand this type of stress and I start to feel like a freak..(if that's an appropriate term) I try to feel ok. I tell myself many positives. I have some spells of feeling better. I have people who tell me I'm a good composer, even great ! But as soon as I try to take on a challenge or promote my work to other the feelings of sickness, palpitations, fear come back double intensity. I've tried mindfulness, antidepressants, therapy etc...etc...
At 61, I have unfulfilled dreams and aspirations. I will not be happy until people cherish my work but I am to much of a perfectionist to let them hear it.....Life is rough at this point. 
World situation and Covid have also changed my panic level to higher.
I will say this to you however in hoping you can get better: Some of the stress can be traced back to events like fear of war, fear of pandemics and fear of change If you really dig deep into the past. Also being bullied (even if you never thought about it it can still creep into your subconscious)

"I totally relate. I’ve felt this was since middle school until now. The last few years have gotten better.

I had a job before college that helped me feel comfortable with my awkward self, and I was able to be more outgoing in college and actually have fun for a little while. But the anxiety and stress were always there and I’d have breakdowns and burnout.

Nowadays I try to correct my thoughts and ask myself why I think or feel that way and that sort of helps make them less powerful. At the end of the day, none of this really matters. Some people in society decided “hey! This and this matter and if you don’t fit that that is bad” when the reality is we are all people trying to figure life out before we die. So try to remind yourself this is your life, you are meant to enjoy it, and find ways to help address your anxiety so they’re less powerful.

Take that stress you're experiencing and turn into something positive. 

They say the best workouts are during heartbreak or stress. Understand everyone starts somewhere, take it easy on the alcohol, drugs, nicotine etc. Eat healthy and get those workouts in. Weights, cardio, hit up the farmers market and cook a meal yourself.

Understand what your triggers are. Do you feel more anxious and stressed when you're doing something in particular? Certain job? Fear of unknown? Meet some people to help you chill and establish relationships. Don't spend too much time on your phone, go outdoors, breathe in clean air.

"If you are breathing through your mouth, it will impact your physical & emotional health. 

Emotionally each breath will send messages back to your brain that you are stressed because you are breathing as if you are stressed - fast & shallow. 

This creates a vicious cycle. Mouth breath > stressed > more mouth breathing > more stressed, so the process continues.

Physically each breath, you are using up to four times as much energy as a functional breath creating fatigue. 

You are also not optimizing oxygen exchange so you are getting low oxygen to all areas of your body, including your brain. 

This all contributes to the following: 

Stress 
Anxiety 
Lack of concentration 
Bad posture 
Fatigue 
Poor sleep

The issue of dysfunctional breathing is habitual so it can be corrected.

"It got my thinking the last few days.
It seems like nearly all stress are related to money?

“I have to do X to be produktive” - So I can earn money.

“I have no time for X (friends, hobbies, SO)” - Because I use my time to earn money to survive.

“I’m not where I want to be in my life” - Because money dictates where you live. How you travel / get from A to B. What activities you can do. What people you are able to spend time with. 

“My health is stressing me out” - Because you don’t have the money to remove your stressors in life. And you don’t have the money to get the prober food/healthcare.

“I can’t find/keep a gf/bf” - Because all you energy goes to work/earning money just to survive."		post	37.90267740323018	female	White	0.8518779873847961	na	na	na	10	stress

I lose the ability to speak, can’t understand what they are saying, my head stings with absolute pain and my eyes flash different colors (I DO have migraines but this is like nothing I’ve ever dealt with)

I do have anxiety and panic attacks (and my panic to need to leave proves to me it was some sort of attack) but I have never had symptoms like this with it and my heart rate was 75 the entire time.

For me using my breath in and out of stressful times was a life changer.

"Why would your SO face charges for having a knife? Sorry, I don't know where you are from, so I made assumptions.  In the US, most states it's largely ok to carry a knife. Some states have restrictions on size, whether it's lockable or fixed, etc... but a knife in and of itself is just a tool. Unless they are strictly forbidden in your area, or your SO had a prior conviction or other reason to not be allowed one.... I can't imagine just carrying would be an issue. Is there more to the story?

Regardless, wish you both the best and good luck. As stated, visit /legal and also seek an attorney. It sounds like it could be a serious charge it's illegal to carry or they aren't allowed to."	Popular-Bit1226	reply	na	na	na	0.9994537234306335	no	no	strong	na	stress

That's a pretty bold assumption without proof. As a licensed concealed carrier, I disclose immediately. (That's the law in my state), but many others don't have that law, so there is no requirement to disclose. Carrying is not the same as brandishing. Im stating that because a firearm is a far cry from a knife. If states recognize the right to carry a firearm, how can they poasible view a knife in the pocket as a threat? Sounds like you have an officer who is trying to make a statement.  Be careful. Get good legal counsel. Be respectful and please please please get a lawyer. I'm sorry you are going through this.

Last month I was on a hike and slipped off an ice shelf about 40 feet into a freezing lake. Luckily, the water was exactly deep enough that I didn’t break my legs, I didn’t hit a rock or something on the way down, and I was able to climb out. I’d call that *extreme luck.* I thought this type of experience was supposed to make you refocus on what’s important, but I came out of the drink still just as anxious about money, the future, not being good enough, not “making it” etc and needing to have all this stuff figured out *tomorrow.* Outwardly I have a very good life but inwardly I’m constantly plagued by self-doubt and anxiety. It’s honestly ridiculous and I feel like a baby. How do I start truly appreciating the gift of life? I’m 23 and have been like this for about 5 years. Thanks.

You aren’t a baby. It’s normal to have to PTSD after something that really scared you. You can learn some tools to no longer allow you to be plagued by this. It may take counseling. Our Brain doesn’t know the difference if you are thinking about past or future or current. It thinks your are always thinking current and the feeling of the thought causes you to experience over and over again. It’s part of the survival mode in our brain.   I have a method that I use to begin to get more awareness.

I’m so stressed out. After months of looking for places to live in my college town, finding a guarantor, and being approved for a place, we might not end up living anywhere at all. I (F19), and my partner (M21), might not have a place to stay for my upcoming school year. For background information, my partner has had an unfortunate life. He was neglected by his parents, forced to work at a young age, faced multiple forms of emotional and sexual abuse, and overall, struggled to remain stable. Regardless of his unfortunate life, he has always been an amazing soul. We’ve had a couple of cracks throughout our relationship but, as we matured, we sealed them all. For a short period of time, my partner was kicked out and disowned by his parents throughout our high school career. Fortunately enough, my family was able to take him in until he got back on his two feet. For my family, their definition of “getting back on your feet” meant that you could accomplish it in the span of 2-3 weeks. It was very difficult for my partner to find a job at the time since COVID had barely begun to die down. Since my parents saw that my partner was not getting back on his feet soon enough, he was kicked out once again. My parents saw that I was temporarily helping him with his finances and were immediately enraged. I did not mind helping my partner since I adore him wholeheartedly. Also, because I am on a full ride scholarship, I often get large refunds. Since then, my parents have had a negative impression of him. They think that he’s lazy, incompetent, and he’s unable to be a good enough partner for me. My parents cut him off and continuously shunned me for continuing with him. The entire period that my family cut him off, my partner successfully got back on his feet and was able to help himself. My partner and I decided (after multiple months of discussion) that it would be of our best financial interest to live together. It took my parents a lot of hardcore thinking but they finally agreed. My parents decided that with my scholarship refund money and everyone else’s income, it was possible to lease. My partner and I had a good amount of money saved separately until it was time to sign the lease. Unfortunately, because we completely drained all of our finances with the deposit and other fees (costing us around 3K) he does not have the money to pay for his final month of rent. Can our future landlord null the new lease if he is evicted? I’m freaking out and continuously crying because I thought for once something worked out.	6irths	post	15.084570556075134	male	White	0.9935114979743958	na	na	na	3	stress
"I don’t know where you are located, but unless the landlord of the old place is the same as the new place I don’t see any way of anyone finding out.  Also, eviction generally takes time.  The problem would probably be more than the previous landlord could take you to court for the last months rent eventually.  

All that being said, if $3k drains you to the line of homelessness, perhaps you should consider a cheaper apartment or waiting a bit.,."	6irths	reply	na	na	na	0.9935114979743958	weak	no	no	na	stress
"Depending on your partners past relationship with the landlord: he could explain his situation. Communicate proof of what’s going on and see if an arrangement can be made over a span of a few months to pay the remanining rent. If your partner has a place to live for that month he could see if he could end the lease early as well and offer to help find a suitable tenant for  the space that the landlord would approve of. 
Also, depending on where the unit is, if city bylaws allow it and the landlord allows it, he could make an arrangement to allow the unit to be subleased as a short term rental for the month. it wouldn’t be time consuming at all, though this might cause more issues then it’s worth if discernment isn’t used with picking clients. Usually around this time of year units have a low vacancy rate and are at least 1/3 higher in nightly rates then in off seasons. This would allow him to also use the unit still during the days that the unit isn’t booked. Insurance is one thing to consider. Platforms like Airbnb have a good overall policy when it comes to insurance as long as you follow the proper due-diligence. Again, I would not recommend doing this at all without the landlords permission."	6irths	reply	na	na	na	0.9935114979743958	no	no	no	na	stress
There looks to be a lot going on and you need to give yourself grace. How would they find out about the eviction? There isn’t usually a way unless there was an eviction recorded in the courts and it shows up on credit. There is deeper moments here for you in seeing that. You are an adult and sounds like newly adult. It may be a good idea to learn about adult children of dysfunctional families. In a group like this you’ll gain some tools to know that you make the best decisions for your life and whether it’s to leave him or keep him or listen to parent advice or not, that ultimately you have the tools to do everything you need with life. You are exactly as you need to be and the overwhelm is around for you to begin to know you have the power in yourself to know that you are amazing. Take care. Everything is working out for you. 🙂	6irths	reply	na	na	na	0.9935114979743958	weak	no	strong	na	stress
"During my final year of college, I experienced overwhelming stress. It affected me physically with headaches and sleep problems, and emotionally with irritability and withdrawal from loved ones. I felt trapped in a never-ending cycle of obligations and struggled with feelings of failure. It taught me the importance of self-care and seeking support during tough times.

I think many mental disorders can be stress related because of the depletion of important vitamins and minerals and nutrients. B vitamin deficiency and schizophrenia have many commonalities. I used to do lots of black coffee and fast food and my anxiety and paranoid thinking was getting worse over time. I eat lots of meat and eggs now and switched to Yerba mate tea.

"Hello there! I had a question directed towards the emotional/energy state of someone who just underwent a long stretch of consistent pressure and stress. For context, I just finished my first year at Uni, as a Physics major.. and boy, was that tough. I did very well, and it was easily my most solid academic year EVER. Here's the thing, I barley graduated highschool with passable grades (3.023GPA), but I got very lucky and aced my final exams and was accepted to the UC system. I wasn't going to let this opportunity slip me by; I was through procrastinating, and being a general underachiever. I want to go to grad school at MIT, and you need to be especially exceptional to pull that off.    


I had never worked so hard for academic success, or heck, even worked much at all. I had never neglected sleep for schools sake, or sweated for an exam until I got to college. The idea of stressing over my GPA was completely foreign to me, but now, it's one of my largest priorities as a young adult. Good news, I pulled it off! I managed to get through a whole year of college without caving in to laziness. I was able to manage increasing stress very well, finding that I could utilize it to propel my work with the energy it offered. The long hours of work flew by, and I didn't much mind getting 5-6 hours of sleep (or less) if it meant an A. Despite my lack-luster work ethic in early academia, I managed to quickly develop a system to allow me to succeed University - I procrastinated becoming responsible haha.   


I guess that's where the problem arises. Though I was able to shape up, I can't help but feel that this whole process was a shock to my system. I didn't so much as think about homework in highschool, letting late worksheets stack up in the dozens, while now I stay up worried that I didn't maximize my score on even the smallest assignments. I don't feel like my brain got the proper chance it needed to get used to demands of college. I was able to do it, yes, but at great cost to my energy and stress levels. I wasn't conditioned for the work; I forced myself to be hardworking. I might've not been the most disciplined person, but I was very driven. Now that it's over, I figured I was going to need a long-overdue break as I definitely burned out once or twice during that time but still managed to keep myself going. But I don't know when this exhaustion will end.   


It's been almost 2 weeks, and I feel almost as tired as I did when I got back home. It's hard to get out of bed sometimes, there's less resistance towards indulging my bad habits and vices, menial tasks take more effort than they should. I get it's Summer, but I am also taking online classes to get ahead, and I'm worried this will affect my performance. This all sounds like burnout, so I guess I wanna ask, how does one deal with this? This is my first time! Thank you.   


tldr:   


Forced myself to perform very well during my first year of college after previously being a bad lazy student. Did very well, but am now burnout (I think). How does one deal with burnout? Worried, as I'm taking online classes at the moment.

"You already took the first step aknowledging the problem. 
The second step is to accept it will take a while, so plan accordingly, and don't try to force yourself to be productive.
Take this as an opportunity to learn your limits and how to manage your energies. 
You need to work on your physical recovery: sleep, SLEEP, healthy food, no alcohol, no cigarettes or drugs, drink plenty of water. Physical activity is good, but don't force yourself right now, just go for a walk and relax. 
Then the mental recovery: do something you enjoy, or something new (but not stressful), go out, call someone. You need to focus on something that's NOT productive, you need a mental break.
Take some time to write down your thoughts and reflect on what you are experiencing and what you can try to improve, so next time you won't start from zero if it happens.

"If you're going through a lot of stress in your life, try limit the stress you're putting on yourself whilst you slowly build up your mind and bodies resilience to stress.

Tension headaches can be caused by a lot of things, from an underlying neck nerve issue to emotional stress.

I'd recommend limiting anything that may be adding cortisol into your body (coffee, alcohol, smoking, taking on too much work)

And I'd recommend implementing practices into your daily routine such as breathing exercises and cold water therapy. These practices will help you gain control of your autonomic nervous system and I guarantee it will help if your tension headache is caused by stress.

Also try some neck stretching which will help if it is an underlying physical injury or physical stress

"I would first recommend talking with your university residence office and asking what the terms are on living on campus. That may involve speaking with your advisor or other academic official to figure out if you qualify to live in university housing.

If you do not qualify for on-campus or university housing, then you need to find off-campus housing like you mentioned. If so, then your residence office may have resources to help you find a place to live while taking your classes.

If you are in the US, then there is a resource (that I still use) called Roomies. You can find sublease in your area that are cheaper than finding a whole apartment/house to rent yourself. In fact, there are a bunch of services like that. Eg: Roomster, Spareroom, Padsplit.

I'm not familiar with this and I've only heard about it, but there should be government subsidized apartments that may be available (Again, in the US). I don't know your budget, or financial situation, but this may be an option.

"I have read countless articles stating exercise is one of the best methods of reducing stress, anxiety, and depression.  
I've honestly tried my best to keep on an exercise routine every day. I did this for well over two months. I saw zero difference. Should I keep going? Does it eventually work? Or does it only work for some?"	user_467	post	34.31289413064407	female	White	0.9994288086891174	na	na	na	11	stress
Yes. It's scientifically proven to be effective. But you have to keep up on it for a long time. Also, what are you considering exercise? Because it's when you reach a state of elevated heart rate that it starts being most effective.	user_467	reply	na	na	na	0.9994288086891174	no	no	strong	na	stress

"It certainly helps, but it's a piece to the puzzle. It'll not benefit as much if your stressor is still overly present, getting poor sleep, bad diet, or even over exercising. Many factors.

Also, if it's something that's been going on a long time, you should expect it to be a long journey to recovery as well. It'll not be easy. It's a slow heal."	user_467	reply	na	na	na	0.9994288086891174	weak	no	no	na	stress
"Lifting weights seem to do the trick for me.
Body weight exercises like pull ups and push ups when I'm at home. 

It will take time to kick in, once you see you're improving with reps or lasting longer on cardio you'll start to feel good. Bonus when you see yourself physically change for the better."	user_467	reply	na	na	na	0.9994288086891174	no	strong	no	na	stress

"The absolute best exercise for stress is doing an exercise or a sport that you enjoy the most and that you can see progression in. For me this year it's been kickboxing. For some it might be lifting weights or mountain biking.

Exercise is proven to help reduce stress and release endorphins making you feel good. BUT exercise is just one piece of the puzzle, make sure you're eating right, make sure you're sleeping properly, make sure you prioritise recovery.

When you decide to work out everyday, you have to prioritise recovery if you want to continue to be effective in your workouts and see progression.

Recovery can come in many forms but most simply stretch

💯 From personal experience I can say that my stress used to affect me less when I was a regular gym goer. Strength training made me exhausted but mentally I was stronger then.

"Did you ever see 100 babies drowning at the same time while you're the only person present and instead of spending your time saving them, you spend your time thinking about which one to save first? You can't save them all at once, youll have to choose who to save first and who to save second and who to save third...and in other words you have to choose who you let drown. and all that decision making can be really hard. Even if you manage to make decisions quick and well, its still gonna be super stressful to take action.

Thats how I feel with my life. I have so so so many things that I need to get done urgently. Its all equally important and urgent, so I just dont know what to do first, so I just freeze...

My dad has bad cancer. My friends want to kill themselves. My girlfriend wants to kill herself. My own mental health is at its bottom. My mom needs me to help in the household. And other things

I can't take care of 1000 people and things at the same time. But at the same time I really really really don't want to deal with the consequences of not somehow taking care of everyone and everything.

Wtf am I supposed to do? Wtf am I supposed to do first? and second? and third? I feel like that no matter what I do, I will have to sacrifice some people/things in order to have enough time to be there for other people/things. This sucks and stresses me out more than anyone would wanna know

Life is throwing more shit at me than I can currently handle. I'm completely overwhelmed and the worst of this is that I can't just take a break. You can quit a stressful job and say fuck it, ill find another job later. But you can't quit taking care of loved ones who really need you to be there. And other urgent things.

I feel responsible for so many things, more things than I can handle all at once, I dont know what to do, help!"	catboy519	post	17.510447559046703	female	White	0.9949133396148682	na	na	na	6	stress
"You take care of you first. It sounds like you are on a plane that has depressurized. Put your mask on first, before helping those around you.  While it's truly admirable you want to help everyone, who is helping you? Are these friends taking more from you then they are giving, or is their depression and suicide more of an ebb and flow where they can offer you love and support during times when they are in a better place?

Have you ever heard of the Ring Theory? It's a series of concentric circles indicating where a person in crisis should be receiving love and support and where they should be dumping it.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_theory_(psychology)

Basically the person in crisis should be sending their stress to the outer rings of people and they should be receiving love and support in from those outter rings. Not the other way around. I recommend reading through some of it and then realigning you priorities and relationships so that they are supporting you and those around you like your dad and partner.  

Your partner and friend however, also need to either do something to change their situations or if they are incapable to get inpatient treatment if they are truly a danger to themselves or others. Its incredibly tough, but you aren't a mental health expert and trying to take responsibility for it all is so far above your pay grade.  Please take care of yourself. If you burn out and breakdown, there is only one  of you."	catboy519	reply	na	na	na	0.9949133396148682	no	no	strong	na	stress

"Taking care of me is not urgent. I'm mentally ill but that takes many years to get better. Suicide in my friends could happen any moment and my dad is very sick. I wish I could take care of me first and then others but thats not possible because others are more urgent now

If you have 100 pets and no one else can/will feed them for some reason, would you let them starve to death because you need to take care of yourself first? You could choose to give yourself priority but then there are big consequences

I choose not to deal with those big consequences and so I don't have time for myself"	catboy519	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9949133396148682	no	strong	no	na	stress
"I am not gonna try to convince you to take care of your basic needs first. I think the other reddit user is already doing this job.

Not going to lie, from your problems you have listed I just want to ask you: what can you even do for them?

The best thing you can do for your dad seems to me to send him to a hospital and hope that the doctors can help him.There is nothing you can do more than that, if you are not a doctor specialised in cancer.
If he is seeking up a doctor, then you can only hope it will get better.
Also you can ask your mother to help here (e.g. with setting up appointments), which I hope she is doing already.

What can you do for your friends? The best thing is if you can convince them to seek therapy. Maybe help them contact some of the potential therapists. Give them the suicidal help contact number and encourage them to call if needed. In my country there are also some hotlines for when you just need someone to talk to anonymously. Except for that it's emotional support, if they come to you.
You are not a therapist who will fix their mental state on your own.

For your analogy:
You are not the one that has all the food to fill up those pets and make them feel full. Rather, also for yourself, you need to find out how to allow them to find the food they need or find someone to help you to feed them. The owner of a pet shelter doesnt run the whole thing by himself. He either gets people or tries to teach the pets to sustain themselves by getting the food from a prepared bowl.

Ask your mom for the matters with your sick dad.
Or ask your dads relatives if your mom for some reason doesn't want or cannot help. Make sure he actively seeks a doctor, everything else is more or less out of your hand.
Try to encourage and support your friends to seek therapy.
Give emotional support by calling while doing house chores.

And I recommend you to call to find the anonymous hotline yourself. You can vent, and maybe find someone who can give you some practical steps."	catboy519	reply	na	na	na	0.9949133396148682	weak	no	no	na	stress
"If you don't feel yourself, who will feed the cats in this analogy? In not saying step back from everything and solve all your ailments or issues. However, you need to feed yourself and tend to your basic needs. You can't pour from an empty cup as the saying goes.  If you don't take care of yourself, even in the most basic sense your body will force you to at some point.

Please, go look at the picture of the Ring Theory I posted. Your dad and girlfriend potentially are the centre ring for certain things. You are the centre ring for others.  Those primary relationships of importance with immediate family, partners and yourself are at the centre.  

If I have 100 starving pets and only 1 of myself, to go with that analogy, I would be looking to triage.  Battle medicine is harsh realities and decisions to ensure that the precious few resources go to those with the best chances of survival. In different circumstances and with more resources you try to save them all. In the field, you know you can't possibly save them all and of you put too much time and effort into a hopeless case, you risk allowing someone who would otherwise have survived to pass.  There are a lot of mixed metaphors and analogies here.

All I'm saying is I can see your pain. I can see your stress.  I see what tremendous effort you are expending to be everything to everyone and the toll it is taking on you.  I am giving you permission to be a little bit selfish and let a few of the burdens drop from your shoulders. People in the outside rings will look around for other supports if you can't continue to carry them.  Your dad and partner come first, but they also need to want your help and be actively working with you."	catboy519	reply	na	na	na	0.9949133396148682	no	no	no	na	stress

"I had been in this situation, too and these situations make me feel stressed and panicked but we should control it step by step. I'm not successful completely but I try to. First, write down the most important things that you should finish at the end of the week/month/year. Then break it into little tasks. Weekly goals to daily tasks or monthly goals to weekly tasks, etc...
Don't be harsh to yourself, it's gonna be ok. Just break huge things to yourself and make them into micro things that you should complete them.

Wow~ the same thing happened to me too with these same symptoms! I feel you sm but I guess it's kind of mental function you know. I have done all the physical check-ups and I am completely healthy, but sometimes I am afraid that my mental state will become bad like last summer.

"I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing what sounds to me like migraines ie headaches and nausea, when the weather gets warmer. I can understand how distressing and disruptive it must be to deal with such intense physical symptoms. Migraines can have various triggers, including changes in weather, and it can be frustrating to search for solutions or remedies that work for you.  
  
While I can't recommend specific supplements since everyone's needs and bodies are different, I can suggest exploring various options with the guidance of a healthcare professional. They can help assess your specific situation, consider potential allergies or reactions to the air, and offer personalized recommendations. Additionally, it might be beneficial to keep a journal or record of your symptoms and triggers to identify any patterns or correlations. This information can be valuable when discussing your condition with a healthcare provider, as it can provide them with more insights into your unique situation."

"Those people who have little energy, who are apathetic, are precisely people who have little emotionality. They never get motivated, they don't rejoice or ""vibrate"" with anything, and they are turned off. They may be smart and do relatively well in life, but they have never really lived. There are also extremely rational people, who do not give room to emotions in their lives, and sooner or later they have problems.

  
Conversely, there are also those who have an excess of emotionality, and show great energy, but without knowing how to manage or channel it properly. These people are like cars with a great engine, but without a good steering wheel. They usually have no containment, and do not discriminate where to project themselves. In the end, despite the great energy that their emotions give them, they do not achieve anything concrete in life.

  
Curious as it may be, emotions being so important, since they are the ones that deliver energy to life, they are still very little understood, and, worse still, we have never been taught to manage them. That is why they sometimes cause so many problems, and that is why the concept of emotional intelligence that has become popular lately is also so important. This concept clarifies several things, beginning by restoring the true importance and role of emotions in life, showing us the fallacy of considering man as a solely rational being.

  
Life without emotions would be empty. There would be no joy, love, contentment... we would be robots. Very programmed, effective and efficient, we would not make mistakes, and we would perhaps be very diligent. But not only would we not have personal energy, but also no strength, life or ""soul""."

"Hey Reddit… 

I don’t use this app much but I definitely consume a lot of its content via YouTube, Ext.  With Reddit not being able to hold a whole video like YouTube figured I’d kinda start here and go from there… I’ve been “creating” content for quite sometime now that I think is enjoyable at the time of posting or creating.. but lately there’s this little voice in the back of my head that contradicts everything I do and it’s made for some really tough times where the decisions I’ve made effected how things moved further.. deleted videos, deleted channels, not fun stuff for anyone’s mental or physical health as many of popular creators have stated. so I guess because of Men’s mental health awareness month I’m here now to get kind of get a gathered consensus for those who have a creative mind and just can’t escape the overthinking aspect of it no matter the advice. 
I’ve slowed down a lot recently and it’s not that I don’t enjoy creating things but my mind is so heavily induced by everything I consume my drive for my particular ideas of content has been weekend. I don’t post because it’s not good enough.. so in return I don’t get to use my creative brain and don’t gain the traction I want/need to continue everything else I plan for in the future. 

It’s a loop… and it drives me mad cause I know it’s what I want to do… I haven’t fixated or dreamed of anything else. 

I love to be original but it’s hard to be original now with everything either being done in some form or being original doesn’t shine well or whatever.

Not exactly sure what I was expecting of this post but. Hope it finds some readers in the same kinda situation and maybe you have an effective way to not be who you are in the inside I don’t really know…

"I feel the same. I'm a violin maker by trade, and it's been hard to find the inspiration or connection emotionally to create.

I would reduce the amount of media consumption that you're currently experiencing and try and simplify your life. Give yourself time to be bored. Boredom is the soil in which inspiration can grow. It sounds stupid, but have you ever noticed that your best ideas come when you're usually doing something mundane, like taking a shower or doing the dishes or going on a long walk outside?"

"I don't go into any detail but want to put the NSFW just to be careful bc I explain the new trauma a bit. My fiance (28m) and I (23f) both already had PTSD from many different events. Both in therapy and getting better over time which I was really proud of. But we tried to help a friend, not knowing they get very violent when intoxicated (was no indication of this and hadn't seen him drink until things went south). When we cut ties he started terrorizing us. From 6/04 to 6/07 he broke into our apt 2x, came to our door/sent others too and threatened us 2-5x a day every day, stalking/harassment, had people watching us and reporting our every move to him for money. We went to a shelter after 2nd break in and he attacked my fiance nearby. 

My ptsd went from pretty well managed to debilitating by the time we left our apt. Like I will jump and scream when I flush the toilet even though it's me doing it and I know the noise is coming. I feel awful bc one day fiance tried to hug me when I wasn't expecting it. I screamed don't touch me without meaning to or understanding why. Made him feel so bad even though he did nothing wrong. It would take us hours to mentally prepare just to walk the 2 min to the store for a soda. 

And while we do feel safer here and we'll have a new place soon shelters have their own set of challenges. There's constant fights and medical emergencies, we're surrounded by hundreds of people 24/7 unless in the bathroom, some people have disorders that cause them to scream or just appear threatening/unpredictable. Im 4'11 and look no older than 18 which causes a lot of unwanted attention unless my fiance is literally by my side. Anything you want to really make sure to not have stolen you have to find a way to keep it on your person at all times. 

I'm also really struggling with the guilt I have that our 2 cats are going through this with us. They're safe and honestly taken care of better than we are which is how I like it. I got leashes and harnesses for them so that we could lay down and snuggle out of their crate safely. But it killed me to see them so stressed at first and I'm even more angry with myself that they got used to being here bc I feel like that's not fair. I hate myself that they also don't have a home rn but they both were bottle babies I got at 3 and 5 weeks old so I feel it'd be even more traumatic to give them away. At least now we can still be the biggest constant in their lives. But I cry holding them at least once a day.

I didn't realize how much I was in survival mode/that I've been pretty numb while just focusing on the tasks I set each day until we finally got some good news about resources. As happy as I was it caused a complete mental breakdown bc reality and a lot of suppressed emotion hit me. I don't know how to make it through the final stretch before getting into our new apt. I'm sorry this was long winded so thank you if you read all this. Any advice I appreciate on new coping skills I could use our anything you think is helpful."

"I'm in university. I started out as a pure physics course student. It didn't go well. I got low pointers for the first 3 semesters. Mind you I started uni when the pandemic at its peak so, 100% online and virtual. On top of that, I'm already a huge mess mentally. Depression, stress, insecurity, you name it - I have it all.  
  
I was a smart kid. Got straight As for every big exam. One significant change was when my parents divorced, after that, somehow... I'm not smart again. It stayed that way till now.  
  
Obviously, I was not doing well in every aspect of life, so I defer my education, for 3 semesters. Now, I'm starting back in a few months, but I certainly want to change my course. **Here's the problem. I don't know what I want to change into.**  
  
I know for sure that I don't want to continue Physics but deep inside I want to know what went wrong? Is it the harsh reality that science is not easy, and it gets progressively harder over time, and I just couldn't catch up or it simply not to my level of intelligence? Or does it have something to do with me not being smart anymore - in every sense that make sense to the context. Or is it because I just never like science but it just that I was normalized to this pressured, people-tell-me-what-to-do-and-be-in-my-life kinda environment which causing me to actually believe I love science or worse, believe that I was smart?  
  
But I did manage to get straight As. So, what's the problem here? **What went wrong?**  
  
I need to know this because this is also a main crucial factor before I decide on a course later on. **Where do all of this stems from?** And what should I do about it? Because if I know this, then I can maybe slowly accept the fact that maybe science is never for me, or I was just depressed and so I just need therapy not giving up science or yada yada. So, which one?  
  
I need to know because I'm planning to take either one of these courses: Biology, Language, Aerospace Engineering or IT. OR I'm just reaching and none of this is a great choice. Frankly, I don't know, I just don't want to screw things up again, but I don't even know what I'm interested in anymore. Like... yesterday I was a top student in every subject and suddenly now I'm not any of those anymore.

"Straight up, physics and math are just fucking hard. I had a 4.0 in high school, then took four years to get my gpa above a 3.0 in engineering at school. The average engineering GPA in the US is a 2.7. It’s meant to be difficult, and honestly getting a 4.0 is extremely difficult. I got a 3.3 this semester (2 B’s and 2 A-‘s), and I developed stress hives and gray hairs. It’s my first semester that I didn’t get a C. STEM degrees stress your time management and require a lot of hard work to even pass, so don’t beat yourself up about it. 

And the funny thing in industry is that nobody really gives a fuck about your GPA in engineering as long as you get your degree. Getting involved in clubs like Formula and rocket clubs get you internships, and that matters most. I have had four internships and make more than the median US salary as an intern, even though I was on probation for two semesters and have only gotten above a 3.0 for three of my semesters. Finding friends to study with helps, too, because you quickly learn that even the deeply intelligent people in engineering often feel stupid.

Edit: Also definitely get therapy. School gets extra hard when you’re dealing with mental health issues, and all of my most successful friend are in therapy to deal with the stress load."	Professional-Rip-234	reply	na	na	na	0.9984931945800781	no	strong	no	na	stress

I already typed this somewhere else but I think this will be better understood here. I don’t know what’s going on, the past couple months have been absolute hell and I’m paranoid, stressed out beyond belief, feeling a ton of different things such as being disgusted with myself and so on. My eyelids have been twitching for a good three weeks now due to how much stress I’m under. Anyway, today my mom had an allergic reaction to a cat and was choking almost to death, we pulled over and I didn’t know what to do as she couldn’t speak and I normally need clear instructions to do something. I had 911 typed into the keypad and kept asking if I should call, but she couldn’t answer me then I started laughing?? Not loud or anything just barely laughing at all out of no where and then she was fine. I didn’t feel scared or anything or at least I don’t think I did, hell I’m not sure if I feel anything at this point and I’m not sure if that’s due to having all the stress I could take or what. Even as I’m typing this I don’t feel anything anymore and I don’t know what to do. Well I guess I do feel fear at the fact i don’t feel much of anything, but that’s it. Can anyone tell me if they’ve experienced something similar? Or what’s going on??	River_003	post	25.252799699293092	female	White	0.9981168508529663	na	na	na	10	stress
"I have the answer. It's called depersonalization. 

It is a common symptom in people who are undergoing periods of high stress and anxiety. 

Basically, what it is is that you are under such emotional strain, or even physical strain, that your brain decides that enough is enough and essentially turns off your emotional processing until it feels like the coast is clear. The reason that this happens is because you need to be able to act rationally and without fear during emergencies or life-threatening situations, so your brain turns off the area of itself that would normally cause you to be crippled by fear in order to get you to safety. 

This can be activated by an acute traumatic experience, or it can be a slow-burning, insidious build up over a longer period of time. You end up in the same place, though. 

For most people, this is a very short lived experience, and subsides after the threat/stressor is gone. But, for some, like us, the switch gets stuck. 

But fear not, you can reverse it. It takes some time to do. There is no medication that can do it, only healthy habits, self care and time. You have to show your brain that it's all okay, and that there is no threat. It's tricky, though. Because your brain interprets the threat in a weird way. Since there is nothing physically in front of you to associate the threat with, and the actual threat is stress and anxiety, your brain doesn't know where to place blame, and so blames the VERY EMOTIONS that it produces. It thinks that the emotions are the enemy because there's nothing else to blame. But in reality, there's an external factor that's causing these feelings. The feelings themselves are harmless, but the brain doesn't know that. So, it turns the dimmer switch on your limbic system until it thinks it's okay. The problem is that your emotions never actually leave you, so any time a real emotion is conjured, your mind thinks that the threat is back and tries its best to get rid of the discomfort and turns the switch down again. 

The best thing to do is to, first, improve your lifestyle. Be that eating better, getting better sleep, exercising and going outside, socializing etc. That's the easy part. 

The harder part is accepting the anxiety and stress. You have to allow the unsettling factors just be. Just live amongst them. Allow them to stay as long as they want. This way, you are training your brain to not view these things as threatening anymore, and reacclamating your brain to experiencing emotion again while feeling safe at the same time. 

I've been going through this for a while now myself. It gets better. You just have to accept the way you are with no judgement and take care of yourself. Healing will take time, and you can't put a timeline on it either. It'll take as long as it takes. Some people feel like themselves again after a few weeks, and some a few months. 

On top of all of this, I highly advise seeing a professional who is well-versed in dissociative disorders.

"Don't fear. There is a way out of this. Anxiety is a treatable condition. Your DP/DR (Depersonalization/Derealization) is caused by your anxiety. The DP/DR is just a symptom of it, and it's not the actual issue, fortunately. 

There are ways to manage anxiety and stress that can eventually get you to the point to where it doesn't impede your enjoyment of life. But it takes time. And by time I mean not a few weeks, or months. You'll see improvement in some aspects pretty quickly, but the psychological patterns that your mind is used to using to cope that are now hurting you will take time to train out. 

Anxiety is a thought pattern, more than anything. We start to obsess over things that aren't even affecting us in reality. We start to live in the future and put too much emotional focus on hypotheticals. This puts our minds in a state of constant vigilance. As a result, we start to experience physical symptoms. Our pupils dilate, our muscles tense, our digestive system shuts down, we develop a tremor from jacked-up nerves, etc. 

You can live a better life. The thing that took most of the weight off of my shoulders was when I realized that I was going to be okay. That anxiety can't hurt me, and that it was my REACTION to the anxiety that hurts. We have to learn to change our reaction and relationship with it."

"And that's okay. You have to roll with how your body is for now. 

Depersonalization is characterized as a temporary disconnect from your thoughts, emotions, body and surroundings. 

Blank mind is a classic DP symptom. If anything, you can use it to your benefit. Meditation focuses on having a blank mind as well. Just because it's blank, doesn't mean it's not there. I know you're used to your mind flying all over the place with abstract thoughts and musings about the universe and nature. News flash, overthinking and rumination will weigh you down and spiral you into a pit of darkness. Overthinking is NOT being intelligent. If anything, it's a waste of your mental resources that you could be applying to the world around you. But instead, we sit, trapped in our own mind, withering away in reality. 

So, embrace how you are for now. It will pass. Just build healthy habits, care for yourself and most importantly find a professional to talk to."	River_003	reply	na	na	na	0.9981168508529663	weak	no	no	na	stress

"You have to consider the fact that, when under stress ,the stress itself intensifies normal things that usually wouldn't be stressful. So it compounds on itself. If you take that perspective, and try and realize that a lot of the things that may be stressing you out right now are quite trivial if you had a different mindset.

When you're stressed or anxious, your emotional center hijacks your logical center and turns it against your best interests. So these things that may seem critical probably aren't in reality."	SurvivingDisability	reply	na	na	na	0.9982877373695374	no	no	no	na	stress

"It's taken several long term jobs and a couple of burnouts to finally understand what is happening.

Today at work I had back to back meetings, interviews, workshops. 10+ hours of the stuff. A couple of snafus with contracts and having to deal with supplier fuck ups etc.

By the end of work, I could feel what I can only describe as scratchy cats flowing through my veins. Like pure agitation. Cortisol, adrenaline, you name it.

Trying to sit down and relax I felt on edge, like I'd forgotten something urgent, like I'm under attack.

I've been finished for a couple hours and still feel a weight, a dread. 

And it'll all start again an hour after I wake up tomorrow.

No wonder I feel under attack at work in jobs when I feel like this and nothing particularly terrible has happened. The accrued stress of the day is mounting on top of each day. I am exhausted.

I need to learn how to manage this better - I'm my households only breadwinner. I am the leader in my organisation. I am also on course for another burnout of I can't sort this out.

I was in a similar situation when I was chronically stressed. I was dealing with a lot of the typical physical symptoms along with some bizarre sensations like the scratchy cat feelings. 

Soon after, stress turned into chronic stress and anxiety and flipped my life upside down. 

The foundation for overcoming this was working on my nervous system daily. 

Your nervous system is sympathetic dominant now; you want to swing it to the parasympathetic branch as much as possible.

"Hey,

  
I'm feeling extremely stressed and overwhelmed with unending workload of ongoing tasks. Despite prioritization, time management, making a weekly planner... it seems impossible to keep up.   
I need to meet deadlines and the time available, despite being on summer vacation, is never enough. Things already feel unsustainable as is, and I feel I may have to cut out the time I give my passions and free time too. I wasn't able to pursue my passions in the past, and I feel when I enter university the cycle will simply continue. 

  
I need help getting out of this rut.  
More details below.

  
The following are my commitments:

  
1) University Research

  
I need to look into universities, apply, study for admission tests, plan visits to the university with my parents, check all requirements and make sure I do everything before their deadlines.   
If not halted by other things, I look at 1 or 2 unis daily. It takes me an hour (including checking emails and previous unis for the rest of the procedure).

  
2) Future Career Research

  
I need to look into the process of how I could practice as a psychologist in the US or Canada, as I want to settle there in the future. Currently the main thing is to look at education requirements, look into individual states and provinces, mail them about equivalency and comparability to APA accredited programs, and also to the NACES centre for equivalency. There are a lot of states/provinces. Sending out all the mails is very time consuming.

  
3) I'm dealing with what was once an addiction

  
I'm not ""addicted"" anymore but it still affects me and I need to spend time thinking about it / researching this as well

  
4) Faith Research

  
I think there's a good chance an afterlife exists and I need to be following a certain religion, and I'm looking into it from a theological / logical perspective. It's very cognitively intense, and requires hours of thinking. Technically one could delay this, but I'll just keep delaying it forever then, and I want to finalize this and build my life around a firm decision based on the existence or non existence of god/religion, and I also don't want to face consequences in the afterlife, which is eternal unlike this life. I'm never gonna be ""more free with my time"", I'm always swamped with stuff, and I believe I make the best use of my time as I humanly can. 

  
5) Other dailies and things to think about  
Passions and personal projects (exercise, language learning, etc)

  
I have a job offer and I may really need the money but it will deduct a further 10 hours from my day. 

I'm already unable to manage everything, I don't think I'll be able to manage with this.

  
This also assumes I never struggle with my emotional health and never need to process or cope with shitty people that I'm stuck with for now, or other things from my past that bother me.

I also have things that keep coming up in the daily.

  
6) Time to just breathe and rest  
(excluding the 5 min breaks I take between tasks)

  
.........  
I have a planner which I follow about 80 percent daily. Can't seem to follow it perfectly but I do my best daily. Just don't know what to do..."	RockmanIcePegasus	post	20.567774887344935	female	White	0.013622495345771313	na	na	na	2	stress
"So. It's all laid out in your post. You're overthinking and overanalyzing SO MANY THINGS. T you have to just let go on some of this stuff. You don't need to constantly research your future. It's important to plan, to a good extent, but you haven't even reached university yet and you're stressing so much about it that it's killing you. This is not healthy. This level of worrying about the future WILL destroy you, and not in a metaphysical kind of way either. 

I'm currently dealing with the fallout of a nervous breakdown of sorts from the same shit. Overworking, over worrying. I can say that when it finally tipped, it altered my life for the next while. I'm taking things easier now and I'm not worrying so much about things that aren't in my here and now. 

You have to lay off the ""research"". Because it doesn't sound like research so much as obsessive overthinking, which is detrimental to your long-term health. 

So you've got to make your health a priority, because if you don't, you won't even be able to handle any of these things that you're worrying about anyways."	RockmanIcePegasus	reply	na	na	na	0.013622495345771313	weak	no	no	na	stress
"I felt this was me being ""proactive"", ""responsible"" and ""taking charge"". But yes this is not sustainable and I do not want to continue living like this, it makes me feel shitty, I consider quitting my whole routine everyday. I was afraid of not doing enough for myself and dealing with consequences and falling behind...

I guess uni stuff is stuff I really need to be looking into. This will end within a month or so. That and faith would be my top priorities.

I am going to research whatever I can for the whole future career thing (just checking education requirements of foreign countries) within a week and then drop this from my schedule. One thing down. 

I probably don't ""need"" to be researching into the addiction daily. I can alternate this with the future research thing ig.

Am really not ok with cutting down on the number of personal projects I'm working on, so I'll cut one daily too. Not like I ever did both daily lol. Might also reduce the number of days I exercise on. 

I didn't want to make these reductions because I wanted to get to where I wanted to faster, but if it's hurting my health then it's not worth it and unsustainable, like you said.

"I just need to let this out and I feel like this is the correct place to do it.
Bottom line is, I’m stressed and have been for months. I work so hard everyday, literally everyday. I work two jobs. A main job from Monday through Friday and a part time job on the weekends. I can’t even remember the last day I had off. I feel like with the amount I make it SHOULD be enough to live off of but with rent, food, basic needs, car note, car insurance, etc it feels like I’m working myself to death just to scrape by. I’m tired. I’m exhausted. All I want to do is cry and sleep. I can no longer think straight and on top of that I have to figure out how I’m going to move next month with no funds. I try my best to save but something always seems to come up that takes what little money I have left causing even more stress. I tried looking for a job that pays more than I make now but without a college degree it’s not possible, in some cases I make as much as they’re paying college graduates (which on its own is sad). 
I want to live a comfortable life, that’s all I ever wanted it’s what I’ve been working so hard towards, but that it just doesn’t feel possible anymore.
With everything that’s been going on in my life I can’t sleep properly (I go to bed around 12, wake up at 2 and can’t go back to sleep), I’m not eating as I should (constantly trying to make plans on how to make things work has my mind occupied and I continue to forget to feed myself), and with the lack of sleep and nutrition I continue to feel tired and nauseated. I don’t know what to do anymore.

"A few tips here from an outside eye:

Try going to bed without going on your phone or other electronics. Take that little break to just get things ready for the next day and/or planning for the next day. If you can, then try going to bed a little earlier.

Set reminders or alarms for feeding times. My mom has reminders set for basic things such as when to have lunch and when to go to bed cause she's mega busy.

Go on walks. I'm serious. It doesn't have to be a 3 hour hike. Just a little 10 minute walk outside around the block can do wonders.

Try meditation. I've tried it, but it doesn't really work for me.

The biggest thing that has helped me were three quotes: ""I'll cross that bridge when I get there"" (Helps focus on the present and less on the distant future) ""It is what it is"" (Helps stop overthinking about the past) and ""Yesterday is History.

I don’t know where else to talk about this at all so here it is. I have wanted a girlfriend for seemingly ever. Y’know not just as a “so my life feels whole” thing, but I want someone who is comfortable saying anything to me because they know it won’t bother me. I love being peoples therapists, making people happy, and seeing people happy about things they enjoy regardless of if I do. I just want a girlfriend so bad so that I can be all those things, but I’m 15, socially anxious, and disabled. I see no way of it happening and it bothers me literally constantly. There is not a moment where it is not somewhere in my mind.

"While I sympathize with what you are saying, you are putting the cart before the horse here. 

In life, I've learned that you have to invest in yourself first, in order for someone else to desire to be with you. You have to work on yourself and bring yourself to the same sort of level of care that you want to give to someone else. Whenever you see those attractive individuals who you feel would never give you a chance, forget them, and reinvest that energy into your own life. 

Another thing. Wanting to be someone's therapist, or to fix them or to sit and listen to anything and everything that they say is not a great approach or philosophy. I've been down that road. I used to fancy myself as a ""fixer"" as well. I'd bring broken women into my life and think that I could be the one to save them. But I'll give you the reality check that I had to experience several times firsthand: It never works, and you'll only reap heartbreak and disappointment. Wanting to be that kind of person for other people is guaranteed to end up with you being used. Plain and simple. I know in times like this, when all you want is human connection in any form, even exploitative one-sided relationships seem appealing in some way. But in reality they will only leave you drowning in their wake when they inevitably move on. 

So, don't stress about not being with someone. Look at it as an opportunity to invest in yourself, and enrich your own life. The right time will happen. You're gonna meet a LOT of people in life. High school sucks. I know. I was there, but it's completely meaningless and inconsequential in the long run. You've got a lot of life to live, so start now and build yourself up, and you'll be more prepared to be the best you for someone special."

"These are perfectly normal feelings that a lot of us have. And they can be deeply sad, dispiriting, and disturbing. I’m sorry you’re going through this right now. It’s a very tough place to be. 

Having been there myself and walking with friends and others who passed through this time as well, there’s no easy way out. The best thing you can do is accept uncertainty, be okay with all that you don’t control— which is a lot, and pour your effort into what you can control, which is yourself and how you respond to the world.

You can make pledges to eat right, take care of your health as best you can, be ready for great opportunities when they arise by being positive and energetic, and doing as much as you can with your beautiful magical life as possible.

I promise you, it gets better. Hang in there. Let those bad feelings go when they’re ready to move on. Concentrate on improving yourself. Breathe. Relax. And work to prepare for better future days.

"I'm an entrepreneur, and after a couple of years of burnout, my condition has significantly worsened 2-3 months ago, and I've been diagnosed with moderate to severe clinical depression. I've been having an indescribable feeling of sorrow, anxiety, apathy, helplessness and emptiness; in the first week of the whole episode, it was even hard to get out of my bed. For the past two months, whenever worked (or even just thinking about work), I would experience immense anxiety, fear and (sometimes) anger, as well as physical symptoms, such as massive headache, body tremors, and faster heart beats (and one time, almost hyperventilating). The trauma around anything remotely related to work is real -- I still can't open/reply email, or think of anything/anyone around work at all -- all of these give me tremendous fear and anxiety. Lately, I've been feeling resentment towards my business partner and team, as I believe I'm the most committed one and they have not been fully pulling their weight (which leads to my burnout). I've given everything to the company, and it hurts me to see that they cannot function without me.

Anyway, I've finally decided to take a month off work (totally offline), to try to recover. I'm supposed to go back to work, but I've been having an extremely difficult time getting myself in the right mind space to even think about work. To make matters worse, there was some emergency at work (happening during my leave) that I would need to attend to -- and it's going to be very, very stressful. A part of me strongly want to either leave or shut the company down, but even to do so (which would involve discussing with my business partner and all follow-up tasks) seems insurmountable to me now. Especially the last week has been difficult (potentially from thinking of going back to work), and there were brief flashes of self-harm thoughts. I can't bring myself to think or read (let alone respond) any message about work now.

What would you do if you were me?"	throwaway-78285	post	31.534034156888897	male	White	0.9981275200843811	na	na	na	1	stress
I’m so sorry you are going through this rough time!  Stress can be debilitating!  I wish I could help you quit your job and move off grid to a peaceful farm where you could eat from a garden and meditate all day - but that’s just not realistic for the world we live in unfortunately.  As a person who has suffered burnout, I can tell you that a month off will not even touch the surface of recovery.  While I did earnestly try for some time, there is no way to rush recovery or assign and timeline to it.  What you are feeling is completely normal.  What I would suggest, is for you to be real about your capabilities. Don’t stress about what you have to do, but instead think about what you can do and have compassion for yourself!  Maybe you are only able to work or engage with others for a few hours a day.  Maybe you will only be available for calls one day a week - allowing the other days to be centered on finishing tasks in quiet.  First map out what you think you can do, and be protective of your boundaries and then you will need to communicate this to your business partner.  I know that the anticipation of this discussion will be worse than the conversation itself - but you should realize that you can work and recover at the same time. You just need to be honest about what you can handle. When I first began working after my burnout, I wanted to be the same high energy - over achiever I had been my whole life.   I was stressed at the thought of being so active.  But I quickly realized that type of energy no longer suits me and was actually making it harder for me to do my job.  Now, I’m a few years post burnout and I still set clear and firm boundaries, but now I get excited for a new project because I have established a system that protects me from my desire to overachieve.  I know how you feel right now, and it feels impossible but I assure you - it will get better! You just need to have patience with yourself and compassion for yourself as you are healing!

So I recently started a new job and objectively speaking I work in a high stress environment. I have been noticing many physical manifestations of stress in my body. I’ve gained weight, missing my period, grinding my teeth etc. when I address these issues the response is always the same. “It’s all the stress” I know these problems that I’m experiencing are most likely due to high stress levels within my body but the issue I face is that I don’t feel stressed. Like if someone asked me how I feel I wouldn’t say I’m stressed, I feel fine actually. I thought perhaps I just don’t have a clear understanding of what “stress” really is but I feel like if you’re stressed out to the point it’s effecting your health you would know. I guess I’m just not sure how to deal with this stress if I can’t clearly identify it.	Tommygun552	post	34.87930863064234	male	White	0.9914672374725342	na	na	na	5	stress
"I've been this way my whole life. I've ground my teeth to stumps in my sleep and everything. But, I never really considered myself a stressed person. 

Your subconscious mind will shield you from the psychological aspects. If chronic stress becomes overbearing and unremitting, your mind has a way of cutting your conscious experience off from some of your emotive processes in order to protect you, all the while your brain is fighting the good fight behind the scenes with the stress and anxiety. But, it won't shut everything off, as you still need to function, so you'll feel the physical bodily manifestations."	Tommygun552	reply	na	na	na	0.9914672374725342	no	strong	no	na	stress
"I can relate to this sentiment whole heartedly.  I have worked in a variety of stressful industries and always thought I was overcoming the stress like a champ! If you asked my colleagues if I was stressed, they would all assure you I was always cool under pressure.  Yet, I would also grind my teeth, struggle with sleep, have irregular periods, brain fog and elevated blood sugar levels, despite eating a low sugar diet.  It was only after becoming a nutritionist and learning about how stress effects every aspect of our health did I realize that while I may appear to be calm under pressure, the constant stress was slowly breaking me down.   Now, I recognize the critical importance of managing my stress.  You can eat a perfectly nutritious diet and exercise like a champ - but if your stress levels aren’t handled, your body won’t absorb the necessary nutrients and will not grow muscle or lose fat as you wish.  Stress can even raise your blood sugar as if you’ve eaten a stress candy bar!  I have completely changed the way in which I relate to stress by taking ten minutes a day, and telling my body I’m safe - then proving it. I tell my body I’m safe by stimulating my vagus nerve.  There are lots of ways to do this, my favorite is opening my mouth wide and saying the letter R over and over until it elicits a yawn.  Then to prove to my body I’m safe I do long deep breaths for ten minutes where I expand my chest as if it were an umbrella and exhale through my nose.  While your body and mind will benefit immediately from
this practice, you will feel the improvement after a week or two, and it will only get better from there.  

I also tape my mouth shut when I sleep. This sounds crazier than it is! I use a little piece of medical silicone tape to stop my mouth from opening when I’m asleep- as stress often causes our mouths to open agape.  In keeping my mouth closed, I’m able to ensure I’m taking in long deep breaths through my nose while I sleep, which improves nitric oxide production, which helps oxygenate our blood and lessons teeth grinding, improves oral hygiene and help overall sleep quality improve!

I hope this helps! Sending good vibes your way! ✨"	Tommygun552	reply	na	na	na	0.9914672374725342	weak	strong	no	na	stress
"Usually when people refer to stress, it encompasses multiple emotions that don't feel good to them, mostly anxiety or fear. If you don't feel ""stressed"", maybe a good start might be to be conscious of what you are feeling, which can be a skill to develop ( I know I was able to pinpoint emotions when I was about 14 years old, it usually felt like a confusing cloud of experiences ).

Unfortunately, it's all just the usual. But hard decisions have to be made. You have to identify your stressors and eliminate them, or mitigate them to the point that they no longer stress you. This might mean career changes or other lifestyle changes. Taking it slow for a long time from here on is really the way. You have to give your body and mind time to heal. If you keep on going like this, you'll reach a state of complete depersonalization eventually. I've gone through it. It's pure horror. But the great thing about your situation is you can prevent this situation, and start to gear down and identify the things that cause stress, and the things that make you feel good and add actual value to your life, and center your life around the good things as much as possible.

"Don't let your mind rule you because inside is your inner being, which is what you really are. What we have on the outside is a flesh and blood disguise that hides what we really are on the inside. We are so aware of our appearance, how others see us, as if it were the most important thing. The reality is different: we try to cover up what is inside, which should not be a good thing to try to hide it. Analyze yourself or observe someone who is aware of their aesthetics, observe their past, their life, their environment, their way of being and draw conclusions.  
It also does not mean that you are misaligned, dirty and neglect your body. You have a body to take care of, not to fill it with cigarette smoke, medication, alcohol, drugs and fat.  
  
If you allowed only good thoughts to abound in your mind, you would start to see things in a better perspective and improve your life somewhat. And stop seeing your flaws and others. Accept yourself and accept others. Everyone talks, everyone has an opinion and they do it as if it were normal, as if it were part of our daily life. They even meet to speak ill of someone! If they see a radiant person, they look at them and look for any defect, even if it is very small, and they talk about it, as if it were the most important thing, leaving everything else aside. They waste their time looking for other people's imperfections and divulging them.  
To finish, just say that your life is the mirror of what is inside of you."	Tiagoelche	post	30.752547423158234	male	White	0.004120210185647011	na	na	na	1	stress

"When people say ""overthink"" it usually means anxiety.

Statistics tell us what's best for people in general, not you as an individual.  
  
This article from the American Psychological Association says that most people with anxiety disorders do better with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) than with medicine.  
  
https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/medication-or-therapy#:\~:text=For%20anxiety%20disorders%2C%20cognitive%2Dbehavioral,improve%20outcomes%20from%20psychotherapy%20alone.  
  
Although self-help based on CBT has not been shown to be as effective as the standard treatments for anxiety with office visits, some people benefit from it. Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health, a book based on polls of more than 3,000 professionals, says that The Feeling Good Handbook by Dr. David Burns, a psychiatrist and cognitive therapy expert, is the one recommended most often by professionals.   
  
In recent years, there has been very encouraging evidence for therapeutic breathing, which can be combined with cognitive therapy methods for dealing with worrisome thoughts.  
  
When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
  
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
  
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
  
The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.  
  
Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.

Kind of. You have to learn to focus on the here and now in front of you, and deal with that. You should also realize that people think about you almost never in reality. Most people are too self-absorbed to take you into consideration. This is a blessing, actually. Most folks won't think about you unless you're in their HERE AND NOW. It's not a bad thing, and they aren't being selfish, either. Just practice being selfish, not people pleasing, and focused on what you can do with what's in front of you. Granted, don't be a dick or anything, but prioritize yourself when it comes to your emotional wellbeing. You'll become more alert, present and in the moment.

"Hey guys, I’m a 34 year old male who has generalized anxiety, and it seems to have gotten worse in the last couple of years. I think a combination of anxiety and stress has totally destroyed my health since around 2020. I went from losing a bunch of weight through dieting to then gaining a ton of weight back, especially in my midsection and chest, being unable to lose any weight now, having painful and sometimes debilitating reflux (though a scope has shown minimal damage and no real physical defect), and lately I’m having minor panic attacks at work. 

I genuinely feel like this nonstop anxiety and stress has destroyed my health. I’m trying to meditate each day and limit my caffeine and alcohol consumption, but I still feel very stressed and anxious. I think I’m stressing and worrying myself sick since all of my lab work and visits with doctors have come back without any real results. 

This sounds like an excuse in some regards, but I can’t deny how terrible my health has been for the last few years. Something about the pandemic plus work stress seems to have really messed me up, and I’m not sure how to recover.

The anxiety for me was thinking I could turn why I can't turn it around within 3 to 6 months when the reality is  It's going to take way way longer...as soon as I accept that it's going to take a long time and embrace a small actions that I take even though they look ridiculously small in the moment they will add up..

"  
Hello, I'm a 32-year-old man who had my first panic attack due to work-related stress in 2019, which eventually led to generalized anxiety and depression. I was out of work for 6 months and ended up changing jobs to better manage my daily life.  
  
When I had my first panic attack, an ambulance was called to my workplace because it resembled a stroke. The first step in my recovery journey was to understand and accept that the physical pain was caused by stress and that it wasn't dangerous.  
  
Afterward, I had to get to know myself again. I started meditating frequently and spent a lot of time alone. Gradually, I realized that I had to accept myself and not rely on my thoughts.  
  
There has been a lot of trial and error in choosing treatments, but going to the doctor and worrying isn't the key. It's about finding something that works for you. There's no one-size-fits-all solution to overcome anxiety and depression. What has helped me in my daily life is understanding how breathing assists me throughout the day and how actively using my breath can help.  
  
Everything I've learned in the process of treating stress, anxiety, and depression has given me a completely different perspective on life, work, and daily life. I have developed much more empathy for other people and am very present in my everyday life.  
  
I still struggle with anxiety at times and occasionally fall back into the patterns before the 2019 panic attack, such as excessive alcohol consumption, too much coffee, lack of sleep, and little exercise. However, I have accepted my anxiety and become friends with it, using it as a driving force to further develop myself as a person.  
  
These days, my research revolves around how self-discipline can alleviate stress, anxiety, and depression.  
  
I hope knowing that there are others going through similar struggles helps you continue your fight. Everyone has their unique battle to fight, and I wish you the best of luck! :)"	bspencer626	reply	na	na	na	0.9964709281921387	no	strong	no	na	stress
I’m so sorry you are going through this! The effects of stress can be wide reaching and powerful.  I’ve personally struggled with chronic stress most of my life. I always saw it as something I had to overcome as there was no way to avoid stress. I saw the traditional stress management techniques as something best suited for people with a lot of disposable income and extra time. Both of which I lacked.  It was only after becoming a nutritionist and learning more about the body holistically that I recognized how simple stress management can actually be.  When we are in a state of constant stress, your body is pulling resources away from less critical areas of your body in order to protect you from the stressor aka harm.  What you need to do, is to tell your bodies and mind you are safe and that resources should be reallocated! How do you do that? You stimulate the vagus nerve.  There are lots of ways to do that, my favorite is to open my mouth wide and say the letter R over and over (while my mouth is wide) until it elicits a yawn.  The more conditioned your vagus nerve is, the quicker the yawn will come.  Dont worry if it takes you a little longer than you’d like.  The first time I did it, it felt like I was trying forever.  It will come.  So now, you have told your body you are safe.  But that’s not enough. Your body has been in a constant state of stress for a while.  It has trust issues.  That’s why it’s important to followup the yawn with 10 minutes of deep breathing. The kind of breathing where you open your chest wide as if it were an umbrella and slowly exhale through your nose.  The stimulated vagus nerve, and the deep breathing will allow your body and mind to find calm and began redistribution of the resources your body was hoarding to protect you from the harmful stressor.  Ten minutes a day is roughly 1% of your day!  In dedicating just ten minutes, your body will immediately began redistribution of resources and within a few weeks you will begin to feel a noticeable change.  You can’t rush the process and patience is key.  While simple, this method is profoundly effective!

I think you meditate in a wrong place, for people with same problem they need to visit some peaceful place where there are no obligations. In such situation the human brain must stay in quite place, also certain foods can also cause this problem. Just stop listening your brain, control it becouse some day he can kills you very easy. I learned how to avoid some problems, when something hurts me in my head, arm or legs i start to think a about something different and doing some physical work after 5 min i forgot for the pain. Or you should start some program like [this](https://itsgeneral.com/anxitystressprogram) one for your brain activity.	bspencer626	reply	na	na	na	0.9964709281921387	no	no	no	na	stress

I’d say health is one of my biggest stressors anymore. It used to be more social stuff, but health problems really worry me more than anything now that I seem to have made them worse through stress. If I had to say what my next biggest stressors would be, I’d say maybe noise, money, and social situations still make me fairly stressed and anxious.	bspencer626	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9964709281921387	no	strong	no	na	stress

That’s such a nice response. Thank you. I didn’t even realize how bad my anxiety was until recently. I just noticed all of these physical issues starting to pile up, and I could explain any of them. Then I started thinking about how they could all be related and it seems to come back to anxiety. It’s such a pain.

You're looking at things backwards. If anxiety is causing health issues, then it's almost never quantifiable via lab tests. I did the same thing. I got lab tests and the works. All normal.

"I'm an entrepreneur, and after a couple of years of burnout, my condition has significantly worsened two months ago, and I've been diagnosed with moderate to severe clinical depression. I've been having an indescribable feeling of sorrow, anxiety, apathy, helplessness and emptiness; in the first week of the whole episode, it was even hard to get out of my bed. For the past two months, whenever worked (or even just thinking about work), I would experience immense anxiety, fear and (sometimes) anger, as well as physical symptoms, such as massive headache, body tremors, and faster heart beats (and one time, almost hyperventilating). As a result, I've not been productive at work and in every sense of the word, dreaded it. The trauma around anything remotely related to work is real -- I still can't open/reply email, or think of anything/anyone around work at all -- all of these give me tremendous fear and anxiety.

I've finally decided to take a month off work (totally offline), to try to recover. However, I've been guilty about taking the break, especially with regards to our external stakeholders. Of course, I didn't just disappear; my business partner and the team know about my leave. But I've been thinking whether I should have communicated about the break with external stakeholders more properly -- which I did at a minimum because I didn't want to share about condition, which I was afraid may impact how people see the company. For me, the decision to take a break was like an ""emergency break"", because my condition got pretty bad and I was (and sadly, still am) extremely miserable.

Also, around this time I've had lots of guilt and shame around how I should have done better in my work for the past couple of years -- in operating the company, managing people, et cetera.At the same time, I don't think a month is sufficient. I was getting a bit better, but been back to worse again.

How do I overcome these feeling?"	throwaway-78285	post	27.409122023970884	male	White	0.996394693851471	na	na	na	2	stress
"Thanks for sharing your experience on here and I can completely understand how debilitating the whole experience is. Everything you describe is very much symptomatic of nervous system dysregulation and can happen after chronic and long periods of stress. When the body is chronically stressed, it is expected that negative emotions will intensify and then anxiety as well as depression. It is your bodies way of telling you that it needs a break and that your nervous system needs to heal. If you keep pushing and keep going, the feelings will only intensify as the body is denied what it really needs. This can be a cycle especially for anyone like yourself who is an entrepreneur because there is always something that needs tobe done and unless you schedule time for a break, you won’t get it. It becomes a vicious interaction of keeping moving because there is guilt if you stop or feelings of shame about why you can’t keep going which keep you going but then your body isn’t getting what it needs and your mental and emotional health deteriorates. It is impossible to feel at peace, to be able to concentrate or be who you truly want to be when you’re activating from a place of survival.

I experienced this myself coming to a head 7 years ago and had to finally stop and heal. After that I could address the though patterns that were getting me to that point in the first place. Do you ever give yourself any time to unplug? Any time of solitude without phones, people etc? I understand that it may induce feelings of needing to do something but that is something that has to be worked through to transcend it."	throwaway-78285	reply	na	na	na	0.996394693851471	weak	strong	no	na	stress
"First things first, stress or depression is a reactive ""fight-or-flight"" under pressure. It will constantly go back whenever you go back to work because that is where the pressure is. I can only suggest having a countermeasure of stress at work days. For me, it is drinking water, and watching funny videos on Instagram. That way the one month or more vacation is not even necessary.

Plus, also depending on the possibility from your end, is it possible to make the external stakeholders sympathize with you? Meaning when you communicate with them more often about your progress and be transparent with it, it might ease everything out since everyone is on the same page. The seeming pressure from them can disappear that way. But, this is of course depends on what you do there.

It took months and there were good days and bad as things were getting better (its not a straight line up, dont get discouraged if you have a few good days then a bad one, its normal) but I eventually got to a place where I was having fun again in life. Unfortunately though your the one in the driver seat and noone can do it for you.

Think of mental health like a pie and each small thing you do is a slice of the pie. One single thing wont fix it, but a culmination of things will help. Look at your diet, exercise, sleep, brain stimulation (reading, learning new hobbys or skills, ect) sunlight exposure, social experiences, also make sure to only feed your brain positivity on terms of what you watch for tv.

"It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and stressed, and it's important to prioritize your emotional well-being and take steps to manage stress in a healthy way. Here are some suggestions for managing stress:  
  
Practice relaxation techniques: Techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, and yoga can help you relax and manage stress. Consider incorporating these practices into your daily routine.  
  
Exercise regularly: Regular exercise can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being. Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity each day, such as walking, running, or cycling.  
  
Get enough sleep: Getting enough sleep is essential for managing stress and maintaining overall health. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night, and establish a regular sleep routine to help you wind down at night.  
  
Connect with others: Social support can be a powerful tool for managing stress. Consider reaching out to friends or family members for support, or consider joining a support group or community organization.  
  
Seek professional help: If you're feeling overwhelmed by stress, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor. They can help you develop coping strategies and work through any underlying issues that may be contributing to your stress.

I've been totally offline for the better part of the last couple of weeks, but got an urgent update that a commercial deal we had been working on had fallen through, and it may have dire business consequences. It's hugely upsetting because I had hoped that the company (my business partner and the rest of the team) should be able to take care of these things without me, and it doesn't seem to be that way. Things at work are obviously worse now, and I won't be able to go back to work peacefully.

  
Right now, I'm just feeling a whole range of emotions -- sadness, anxiety, fear, helplessness, emptiness, anger and resentment. Maybe it's the depression speaking, but I've been thinking -- I've dedicated so much of my time, effort and personal resources into the company, and it seems that no one in the team (including my business partner) was as committed as me. At this moment, I want to prioritize healing, and even then, I'm not able to fully relax and recover. A part of me want to just abandon everything and focus on healing, but I'm too sad and anxious to even do anything remotely related to work.

  
Apologies for the long post, but I've been feeling so sad and lonely, and advice of what you would do, would be hugely appreciated!"	throwaway-78285	post	37.02865856309427	male	White	0.9923161268234253	na	na	na	1	stress
"Healing has to be #1. The job is only serving to kill you right now. This is classic burnout. Feeling unfulfilled, resenting and feeling anxious. I would slow down or divert before the depersonalization takes hold. I'm currently dealing with that from burnout, and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. I'm also in the process of healing. Basically, you have to prioritize yourself over your work. It sounds difficult, but that's life. Your physical body and subconscious mind WILL NOT submit to your whims. Things will only get worse if you don't do something about it. 

I've put my career on hold for a while myself. I was like you, where I was all in, all of the time, and I would scoff at colleagues who weren't. I spend 8-10 hours a day restoring violins, and I have my own shop at home where I make them. Making them is a full time job itself, but I love it. Long story short, I was burning the candle at both ends, while making great money all the while, and eventually I had to pay for it. I noticed that I started to get frequent heartburn, which eventually led to almost constant heartburn which liked to go out of both ends. Then my hair started to fall out, along with constant fatigue. My face started to sink, and my brain stopped working correctly. I could only think the darkest, most pessimistic thoughts after a while. Granted, I've always been a bit sarcastic in my core personality, but it got to a point where people started to ask if I was okay. This all went on for months, and I was progressively falling apart in body and mind. I lost interest in basically everything. My work, my hobbies. I stopped showering and taking care of myself... 
  
Then I got COVID. I got over the flu-like symptoms in a few days. But then the extra strain on my body and mind from it broke me. It was the last straw. I started having random, crippling panic attacks on the daily. It became so psychologically taxing that my brain deployed the airbag, so to speak. I've gone right months without being able to feel a single emotion. Nothing. The stress from overworking and putting my sense of identity in my work was so great, then capped off with the extra little anxiety bump from COVID, put my mind into a state of deep dissociation. This is common with burnout. Mine is a little worse than a lot of people, because I'm a career anxiety sufferer. 

But the moral is, that you can't just power through it. You have to make a hard decision. If you continue to plod on as you currently are, it will compound and you'll start paying interest. Recovery starts with eliminating the stressor. This is non negotiable, I'm afraid. But it's key to do it sooner rather than later."	throwaway-78285	reply	na	na	na	0.9923161268234253	no	strong	no	na	stress
"Hi all,

TL;DR: I'm looking for techniques to help unwind / destress / reduce arousal (in the academic sense, not the sexy one) around bedtime so I can help myself sleep - both to fall asleep, and to stay asleep. I think things like breathing techniques and meditation/mindfulness/grounding exercises/apps is what I might need. If anyone has been in a similar position to me, I'd really appreciate hearing what exactly has worked for you (please be as specific as you can) and when you do it (e.g. how long before bed you do it if it's proactive, or what you do if you find you can't sleep if it's reactive). I don't think it's sleep hygiene tips I need, my reasons for which I explore below.

My situation:

Sleep problems have plagued me all my life, but recently I've really managed to improve them by getting my own place and building some healthy rhythms and routines. Whilst I would say my sleep cycle is very good now, at least by my standards, whenever I go to bed too stimulated (usually from working too late, but can be other things e.g. driving too late, even something as banal as watching a film or cooking too late) my sleep for that night will often be extremely disrupted. I won't feel stressed per se, I won't necessarily be worrying or throwing things around in my mind, but I am just too ""stimulated"". I don't want to underplay it though, because it will usually wreak havoc on my sleep - last night, for example, I maybe slept an hour, and only from taking a drug (which I am always extremely reticent to do, but I sometimes give in come 5 am). There is every chance I would have not slept at all otherwise, and even on nights where I am shattered and fall asleep early, going to bed too stimulated will almost always result in me waking up 20 minutes later and then being awake for most if not all of the night.

I think I will mostly benefit from hearing routines, rituals and techniques that people have that really help their body and mind to relax, rather than advice around sleep hygiene. I will welcome any advice of course, but just to give you an idea of what I currently do in order to try and help myself sleep:

* One caffeinated drink a day (usually tea), never after noon
* Getting up at the same time every morning and immediately going outside to spend 30 minutes in sunlight, and going to bed at the same time every night, not using the bed for anything other than sleep
* Lifting weights around lunchtime - the one thing I do need to do more of though is cardio
* Not eating too close to bedtime, but ensuring I am satiated with adequate protein every night when I get in bed
* Avoiding stimulating activities within 3 hours of bedtime (but my job means occasionally I have to work late, or work overruns meaning I do chores or other activities too late, which is where the problems arise). I have also found bedtime reading to be hit-and-miss, often stimulating me more than relaxing me.
* Listening to gentle podcasts/lectures/etc whilst going to sleep - this has probably been the most helpful of all of the above, but is not foolproof

The majority of the above have all helped my sleep problems on a normal day, but the ""sleep drive"" they give me is completely overrun if I do anything too stimulating too late - even writing this post could qualify as a stimulating activity.

Because this is a once-every-so-often problem (but with predictable and sometimes unavoidable triggers), I imagine some people might want to recommend drugs or supplements to me to take as-and-when. All I will say on that front is that I think I've tried them all, and each one has its downsides which means I always regret taking them, so I'm very doubtful there is any advice to be given on that front.

Really sorry for the long post, sleep deprivation isn't good for concision. I really welcome any advice , because this is a huge barrier to my quality of life. Even though it is no longer a problem every night, it's a vicious cycle, in that when life gets busy, I am more likely to be doing vaguely stimulating activities late, and then the sleep deprivation inevitably means I am unable to handle the busy tasks life throws at me. I'd love to have some mental techniques or activities I can try, say a preventative relaxation one to do an hour before bed, and something to try if I'm in bed and sleep is distant (although the problem with the latter is that I will likely just wake up soon even if I do manage to sleep)."

A part of me suspects I'd do better with a kind of active meditation rather than passively listening to someone, but I could be wrong about that.

I forgot to say I don't use any devices in bed, no! Just listening to podcasts on my phone which I find invaluable.

"Okay, so thinking specifically about sleep supplements... the line between a supplement and a drug is not well defined, but off the top of my head, the ones I think most people would call supplements: magnesium glycinate, glycine itself, taurine, l-theanine, tryptophan, inositol, melatonin. Some worked for a bit, none worked forever. Then there are ones which are more in a supplement/drug grey area, like CBD, valerian root, phenibut (although this really ought to be treated as a drug - I mean these all are drugs really, technically). And then there have been countless obvious drugs, both pharmaceutical or otherwise. The only commonly regarded sleep supplement I can think of that I have not used is ashwaghanda.

Of the above (focusing only on the first group, the ones usually regarded as supplements), magnesium glycinate in small dosages (500mg-1g) can be good and I do still take that. Taurine was a godsend until it stopped being one and gave rebound wakefulness. Melatonin is something I think people take too liberally given it's a hormone with such an important function in the body, but that was good to begin with, again until it ceased working.

I am open to other suggestions, but if there's one thing in my life I've learned, regular supplementation of substances beyond what the body naturally can get from diet (or in dosages far exceeding those possible in diet) really isn't for me, at least in the long-term."

"For meditation, honesstly any app (or no app!) will work, you have to put in the time. It's tough at first, but it gets better. You need to commit 10-15 minutes every day for a month, and you will see the usefulness of it I'm sure! I would try any flavor of mindfulness meditation that you like. It's sort of like exercise, whatever works for you is the right thing to do.

For progressive muscle relaxation, you can find tons of guided programs on meditation apps, I just go to head to toe, or toe to head, try to do body part by body part, then repeat. It helps relax the body, but by no mean a cure-all. Good luck!"	Kaettae	reply	na	na	na	0.9924052357673645	no	no	no	na	stress

"I just got off work and need to be in bed in 4.5 hours. I need to feed the dogs, walk the dogs twice, feed the cats, scoop the litter boxes, clean up all the dog pee out of the floor (puppy’s potty training is going… well…) make dinner, put away laundry, scrape off some puppy poop that got stepped in, wash like 6 kittens because a decent chunk of them played in it, and do an hour’s worth of homework.

"2022 was so shit for me, I had so much things going on outside of school that literally almost killed me. Im on my second semester of my sophomore year, and my freshman year, and first semester sophomore year went fantastic (3.9-4.0 GPA). 

This semester, there was so much going on which caused me to breakdown on multiple occasions, skip homework assignments, and feel like literally hell. I tried talking to my counselor and teachers, and even my parents didn’t quite understand my pain. 

Long story short, I’ve almost made it through this semester, and I’ve dropped from having a 3.9-4.0 each semester to a 3.3 because of my personal issues and problems outside of school. Two of my 7 classes depends on my final for me to pass the class due to my grade being low in those classes (Chem and Geometry). Geometry, I studied vigorously and got an 89% on the final, passing with a 68%, which still hurts. On the other hand, I just completed a Chem test. I have a 62.21% in the class, and I need a 51.16% or higher to pass. The test was 50 questions (some being worth 2 points, and some being worth one). I had ran out of time, leaving me to guess about 10-15 questions. I feel like it’s over, and me failing this one class will fuck over my dreams of being an actor, and everyone will see me differently for failing. 

There’s a chance I do pass though, if my guessing was spot on and my accuracy on the non guessed questions were good. 

Do you guys think I have a chance at passing, and there’s a chance I could’ve gotten over a 51%? Will this one failing class and horrible semester kill my dreams, this will for surely not happen again, as I have gotten myself together, and dealt with most of these problems.

It's called anxiety. It's the anticipation of a stressful situation. It's the body's fight or flight response. You have to get it under control before it gets really bad. Eventually it'll become your 24/7. This is how I ended up with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). Now, after decades of it, am I getting it under control finally.

I'm so fucking stressed out, I can't handle it, and I don't even have a job or study, imagine if I did, that would literally end me. I just somehow ended up with too many things to worry and care about. You can't really apply eisenhower's matrix when everything is important and when everything is urgent. The last 3 years I've been stacking up and procrastinating SO MANY THINGS that now my to-do list is extremely big. At this point, even if I turn into a highly productive person, it would still take like a year to get everything done. I've sunk way too deep in this shit. But its also because, I deeply care about some things that other people dont care much about. Thats the way I am, can't change myself."	catboy519	post	15.530598379636096	female	White	0.9990382194519043	na	na	na	4	stress
"I hear your stress through the screen. I have some ideas in order from easiest and least serious to most serious. 
First off, can you talk to your parents about your stress? It’s always good to ask for help (IF from a reliable source). If you can’t talk to them, can you make an appointment with your gp? If that’s too overwhelming, (snd I get that!) you can call the SAMHSA national hotline. They can help you to get help (800-652-4357). If that’s too much, you can call 988. The national “mental health 911”. 

Don’t continue to beat yourself up. Your brain is stuck in a loop and it’s lying to you. You need some help to get your brain back online. That could be meds or therapy or a combo of things. But please, please get help. No one deserves to feel the crushing weight of stress like this. 

Please let us know how you’re doing ❤️"	catboy519	reply	na	na	na	0.9990382194519043	weak	no	strong	na	stress
"My observation is that it could be hormone imbalance.   


my reasoning is - your symptoms a similar to those of someone out of balance.   


the good news is - it can be fixed really easily.   


Look at what is going into your body.  
    
**Diet (both nutrition and mental diet)**   
**medication**  
**life style/environment**   


Cull the things that affect your hormones and give yourself enough time to recover.  
Learn as much as you can about it. its responsible for everything.   


there is a youtuber account Mia adora beauty who talks a lot about it. she breaks it down in fun and simple ways.   


wether you choose to explore that or not. change is inevitable. you will be forced to by circumstances eventually.   
you will get through it like every other person in your position, like i did too.   


you will be okay OP.  
just take a breath and try to tell yourself to practice **solution based thinking.**

"So I really went through a mess of half of 2019, leading into all of 2020.

Without going into specfics of events, but just the symptoms

-24/7 full head/out of it, brain fog feeling by end of 2020

-vivid dreams everyday

-waking up as if I didn't sleep despite over 7 hours of sleep

-sub-clinical hypothyroid by November 2021. No family history

-involuntary head jerks any direction frequently after a series of bad headaches in December 2022.

I've been in my house pretty much since 2019. I never handled what was going on with me as chronic stress and anxiety until January of 2023. After many tests, imaging, and bloodwork these past few years. . .still have doubts as the involuntary head jerks scare me so much. It's been 5 months since I changed my lifestyle. Going out again, exercising, meditating, decent diet that promotes anti-inflammation. 

It's been good. I love doing what I used to do before that stressed year of 2020, my dreams started to become positive even after mostly being nightmares or unsettling everyday for 2 years. But I feel as if I should feel better than I do, like the brain fog full head feeling not being 24/7 at least. Am I being to hard on myself? Expecting too much too fast considering the time I locked myself in? I still have all those symptoms."	FightLiveBeAgain	post	22.608312973494765	male	White	0.995836615562439	na	na	na	4	stress
"It's gonna take a long time. It can take some people several years to get back to normal, but that may or may not be the case for you. The important thing is to be patient with yourself and to not set a timeline. You'll only start stressing about that and do yourself a disservice. 

I can say that the involuntary head jerks are anxiety. Mine will do that too in times of great anxiety and stress, along with my legs and arms. Sometimes it scares me while.im working with power saws at work lol. 

Progress is not linear, and you'll have good and bad days throughout. 

I'm coming off of a lifetime, and it's slow going for me. I know that I'll be better, but I don't have a specific vision for that. Life is a continuation and I know I'll never be my old ""self"" in that I'm always changing and growing. 

Try to view your time in recovery as valuable. You can still live your life and be fulfilled. It's not a limbo period and you should still be living and enjoying your life, which is key to recovering anyways. 

The funny thing is, is there is no point at which you'll be cured. You'll just notice one day that you feel whole, and comfortable in your own skin again."	FightLiveBeAgain	reply	na	na	na	0.995836615562439	weak	no	no	na	stress
"Thank you for words of encouragement. Unfortunately when the head jerks started after my built up headache in December, they happen at least once a minute. Whether I'm calm or anxious. Unless I'm moving around. Even comes with a ratchety movement if I look from right to left. Already looked in Essential Tremor sub and even other motor issues but none had an onset like mine. If it wasn't as frequent I'd be more calm about it. Like my brain just buckled under the stress that day.

Best I can do is continue on as you said. Looks like we're both in our battle."	FightLiveBeAgain	follow-up	na	na	na	0.995836615562439	weak	strong	no	na	stress
"We all have different circumstances. One thing to consider is that your feeling of ""calm"" may not be as calm as you think. If you have chronic stress and anxiety, your brain gets used to this baseline, and convinces itself that everything is okay when that baseline is maintained. Like, I feel ""calm"" at times, but my anxiety is raging like a storm behind the scenes. For instance, I have an essential tremor from GAD. The tremor is almost always there. Only when I'm truly deeply relaxed, or sedated, does it subside for short periods. But all the while, it's there while I feel ""calm"", and in reality, the cortisol and sympathetic nervous system is still firing on all cylinders. 

You may eventually reach a state of depersonalization, when your brain purposefully disconnects various parts of your functioning from your consciousness, such as feeling in specific parts of your body like arms and legs and hands, and often your emotions and memories, all in an effort to spare you from the constant pain and discomfort. It's an airbag of sorts. So you may not even have access to your anxious or stressed feelings at times, or at all times, and you may think that everything is a-okay but in reality your body and brain are still in panic mode. 

But this is all conjecture, and you should consult a real medical doctor. Like a psychiatrist, psychologist and a neurologist."	FightLiveBeAgain	reply	na	na	na	0.995836615562439	no	strong	no	na	stress
"Funny you mention those three doctors! I've seen all 3 when this started, but sub the psychologist with a CBT Therapist. Clean tests. They all say the same thing. We're not sure but maybe stress.

I can tell you have an understanding of how stress/anxiety can stay as an underlining issue even well after the event has passed. That we may be past stuff and just want to get over it already, but the mind and body doesn't move on that fast. Especially in cases if it has been chronic. It's something I've read into but don't hear it at all from people much so it's somewhat of a assuring thing to read. My doctors are bad tbh. Maybe yours have been more open minded and helpful. 

Looked into dp/dr some as well and never felt my case was as extreme as some people who felt like another person, or out of their body. My perception of things have looked ""weird"" or too much to take in at times that I felt maybe I have a mild form of derealization. I've considered lots of what you said like the brain disconnecting me some but still in a stressed/anxious state. Any kind of stimuli that's too much makes my head get that ""full"" feeling or things start looking ""too real"" so it makes sense that it's likely already stressed still and has a low threshold for other stressors even if small or normal.

There's no telling how one person is going to react to chronic stress. So many variables. People will even react to the same stress and anxiety factors differently! You've been great in your responses. I'm really thankful for the reasonings, though not a diagnoses, is still logical given the circumstances."

"When I say non-cliche... I mean stuff that you can easily Google or search on YouTube. They always seem to say some really tip of the iceberg stuff. 

I am wondering if anyone has tactics, videos, or resources with a more applicable/less generalized approach or something more in depth than that first result you get on Google. 

Or perhaps a more in depth explanation to the basics?"	CarolMFBR	post	37.984348141048216	male	White	0.9991389513015747	na	na	na	5	stress

"my first question about this is always what have you already tried? then we can get more in-depth. here's a few starters though: 

1) find a type of exercise you enjoy. not one that is ""the most stress reducing"" or ""the best cardio"" or whatever, just a type of exercise you LIKE to do. this will not only motivate you to do it, it will also make it more effective, as having your nervous system on board will improve your body's efficiency. even if you exercise 10 minutes a day, that is HUGELY beneficial compared to no exercise (there's a lot of research on this) 

2) look into nervous system regulation, polyvagal/vagus nerve exercises and again, practice the ones you like the most. these exercises can help you calm your nervous system 

3) get rid of every task that you don't absolutely need to do. outsource whatever you can (i.e. cooking, cleaning, maintenance) whenever you can 

4) try meditation. if you hate it, fine. but if you give it a month (which I suggest doing) of daily meditation and you don't notice a difference, give it up and know you tried 

5) speaking of eat, eat what makes you happy, and eat more of what is good for you AND makes you happy. I'm not going to say too much here because if you have specific experiences around eating, I don't want to invalidate those 

6) build community. friendships, family, coworkers, neighbors, whoever. do favors for people and ask them to do favors for you. talk to people about your stress and ask them about theirs. notice who shows up, and keep showing up for others. connect as often and as deeply as you can 

7) entertain yourself. watch shows you love, that make you laugh and cry and think. read books if you enjoy books. write if you enjoy writing. play video games if you like them. draw if you like drawing. you don't have to be good at anything, just do it if you enjoy it"	CarolMFBR	reply	na	na	na	0.9991389513015747	no	no	strong	na	stress

"here just to vent to be honest. I have managed to give myself a migraine every day for the last week - I can feel the thoughts swirl into a tornado and then the pain starts, a dull throb that builds every hour until it feels like my brain is being tossed around in an industrial sized dryer. the headaches are so bad that I feel like puking but I don't because that would be stupid. I can constantly feel my dinner sitting in the back of my throat, wanting to come back out. I sleep enough. I eat enough. I exercise. alas, too much brain function. the sheer volume of thoughts is fucking absurd. 

read a book about combating negative thinking, and how you need to actively replace every bad thought with a positive one. acknowledge, analyze, then replace. Maybe it's working but it also feels like terrible advice - I followed it and now I have what feels like QUADRUPLE the volume of stuff in my brain. 

stressed about my career. stressed that even when I make it, I don't manage to make it far enough. stressed about my family and various disturbing, traumatic things that are happening. stressed about my medical condition. stressed that I don't know what the fuck I'm doing with my life. 

But, at the end of the day, grateful to be alive. I suppose even stress is something I am lucky to feel. Imagining now all the people who didn't get to have their lives. I'm sure they'd pay a billion dollars for the privileged position of being alive and in stress. I've begun thinking of life as a kind of cosmic transaction - to get to any of the good parts requires the price of a bit of pain. can't pick and choose the moments you live through. got to live through it all."

"I get really bad tension headaches too. I also struggle with hyper vigilance and my body like rejects the idea of relaxing. I’ve been using anxiety and stress as a motivator my whole life so I have a hard time letting go of it. Stress has been like a protector for me. The problem is that it causes me to burn out to the point where I can’t feel anything and then I get depressed. I’m working on finding a balance but it’s slow going. 

I get nauseous with headaches too. It’s awful. I hate throwing up more than anything so I get even more stressed out by the stress induced nausea. It’s a horrible cycle. Dramamine helps sometimes. There’s drowsy and non drowsy versions. I also use this like silicone scalp massager. Lol I think it’s supposed to prevent dandruff but I use it because it feels so good to massage all the muscles that are squeezing my skull. I also recommend looking up trigger point therapy. There’s versions that you can do on yourself and it’s painful while you do it but it feels really good when you’re done. My other recommendation is journaling. I know that’s an obvious one but it really has helped me. I do it my own way though. I have a google doc where I just type every thought and feeling I’m having no matter how dark.

I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. 

Based on the information you've provided, it does sound like you might be dealing with some sort of eatingdisorder? Your bmi is around 15, Which is underweight. 
It's important to take care of yourself, both physically and mentally. Seeking help from a professional is a really good idea.

There's no shame in asking for help, and it's actually a sign of strength to take action and reach out. I encourage you to find a healthcare provider who can guide you through this process and support you along the way.

Remember, you're not alone in this. There are people who care about you and want to see you thrive. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need someone to talk to."	Grouchy-Trip9582	reply	na	na	na	0.9981502294540405	strong	no	strong	na	stress

">1. ""Why do I feel this way?.. I am shaking, my body is exhausted, if I get up and walk two steps I just get very shaky, trying to relax but I cannot."" -  this is a ""fight-or-flight"" response because it evolved as a survival mechanism, enabling people and other mammals to react quickly to life-threatening situations. This combination of hormonal changes and physiological responses helps someone fight the threat off or flee to safety. Unfortunately, the body can also overreact to stressors. ""Argued for 8 hours"" straight will do that. = You are ""shaking"" your entire system is overstimulated.  Once I got into the hospital because I had such a severe spasm in my throat during the exam period that I was not being able to drink water for 8 hours straight - ended up going to the hospital and they gave me a shot to relax :(  
>  
>2. ""What can I do?"": I made a video on how to handle stress at the moment (if you are interested): https://youtu.be/9jN4XYCAhPE Going forward, address it the same way as the saver stress or burnout:  deep abdominal breathing, focusing on a soothing word (such as peace or calm), visualization of tranquil scenes, repetitive prayer, yoga, and tai chi.  
>  
>3. ""Anxiety became a lifestyle"" - unfortunately, you would not be able to use my video above, because if you take your thought out of anxiety (which is a distraction/avoidance), you would need to face your shattered inner world. In between the two: dealing with the inner world or anxiety, you are still choosing anxiety as an old friend. But in return, you are feeding it with your own energy instead of finding peace inside. - I am telling from the experience. The therapy is not a ""walk in the park"", but the energy of life that is released is totally worth it.

"My story starts with when I was 11, I was living with my mom, we were in poverty at the time. I start the day off by going to school, half way through the school day I get taken out of class and all of a sudden my sister's father who I knew nothing about (since we had different fathers and my mom had custody of us both) was there to take me. I get in in his car with him and his wife, we go and park outside my apartment I was living in with my mom and sister, just to see my sister with a big bag of all my stuff, my sister got in the car and we drove off. I still had no idea about where we were going, but I learned later, very suddenly that now I have to live with my sister's family who I didn't know at all( except for my sister ) my sister's family lived out in the country, which I wasn't used to at all, I had to do daily farm jobs which I wasn't used to, since I had been babies my entire life so I had no idea what a wrench even looked like. My chores consisted of doing wood work with my brother who had lived there for a solid few years already, since he was my half sisters full brother. (Hes about 5 years older than me) he had some form of autism which made him just never believe me when I couldn't hand him a certain tool because I didn't know what it was, so every time we worked, which was about everyday, he constantly verbally abused me.  I also had to feed chickens and such. There were much stricter rules in this house that I wasn't used to, I had 1 hour of screentime a day and wasn't allowed food or drinks upstairs which was where the rooms were. By ""rooms"" I mean these little areas each of us were given, they were about 8 square feet each. One thing I was thankful for in this new household was that we got to eat proper meals, with real meat and not that 'tv' dinner kind of meat. Did I mention that there was no wifi here? I started going to a small school consisting of one hallway. I met decent friends and had some good memories. My life continued exactly like this each day with no major events.

After about 14 months of this, I finally found out why I was taken from my mother, it was because the CPS found out that I had missed a lot of school when I was with her (I did) keep in mind, this doesn't mean that my mother was a bad person, it was just because my spoiled whiny little ass couldn't stand to learn something and my mother wasn't strict enough.

I started to visit my mother for two weekends every month when I was 12, at this point I developed a Midwestern accent, since everyone I lived with had this, it wasn't a full Fletched accent, but I would pronounce ""your"" like yer, and that kinda stuff. Life kept going like that for a few months until my dad visited completely out of the blue, my dad hadn't been in contact with me for a while before that since he was living in a boat in a lake while covid was going. 

During all this I had been talking to a children's lawyer to get me back to my mom, but one talk I had with her before a big court date, was the talk that decided my further, she asked who I wanted to live with. The options were, my mother, my father, and my sister's father, I chose my father, even though we didn't know each other that well, I genuinely believed he was a good man, just wanting to spend lost time with his son. After about another 8 months of grueling court sessions, I finally, finally found out that I could go live with my father. After about 3 days of living with my father, on the date of December 26 the day after Christmas, the birthday of my second brother who was my dad's son. We were celebrating with him, and at around midnight we caught on that the house was burning down, (my loony great aunt took the smoke detectos out) we rushed outside and called the firefighters while waiting in our truck. This house wasnt insured. The firefighters didn't even put an ounce of water on that fire, we and the firefighters just watched it burn down for what seemed like ages, I tried pinching myself multiple times to wake up, but I just didn't. We eventually were able to get a hold of a family friend that lived near, we had to walk to them since no cars could get in or out because of the fences the firefighters put up. We had to walk barefoot on a road that had ice all over it, my brother held me in his arms carrying me so I didn't feel the cold, he slipped though, even while slipping he held me up not even caring about himself getting injured. We got to our family friends car.

I woke up in the family friends house that morning when my brother had to go back to his apartment, and I had to go back to live with my sister's father for a month and a half while my father was busy buying a camper to live in with the last bit of his money. I was able to return to living with my father inside this camper. We lived on our family friends property for a while in the driveway while I attended school still. Unfortunately, I was back into the life of poverty because of this devastating event. After about a year of living in that driveway me and my dad had to leave because the family friend was moving. We didn't go with them because of a falling out. Now me and my father are living in the parking lot of a flying J (truck stop) with barely 100 dollars to live off of a week.

How can I cope with this shitty life?

It sounds like you’ve had a rough life but things will get better for you. You’ll be able to make things better as you get older. It sounds like your dad is trying his best but down on his luck. Look into going to a trade school /tech school for high school so you can learn a skill that will help you make money right away when you graduate. Things will get better.

The point is that you have to change your life. You. Find out what's stressing you, and find out what you want. You have to then make the hard decisions to make this happen. 

Things like a good diet, exercise, getting proper sleep and spending lots of time doing healthy things for your mind and body are the usuals. I would recommend councelling too, if you can afford it."		reply	na	na	na	0.9987083673477173	weak	no	no	na	stress

"Hello,

I hope you all are doing okay! I come here to try and ask a question... 

Has anyone here ever been so chronically stressed that your skin is super sensitive for long periods of time? I'm going through a really stressful time in my life, and after having several panic attacks I've noticed that my skin on my abdomen, especially in the front on my belly is extra sensitive throughout the day, and wearing even a cotton tee shirt feels like sandpaper. It kind of always feels like a mild sunburn going on there. I'll say that there's no fibromyalgia going on, or nerve issues. But, it onset during a panic attack in my car on a road trip a while back, like 5 or so months ago. The funny thing is that it seems to go away when I exercise or am at a deep rest, like having just ate a large tasty meal and digesting on the couch watching a good movie. 

I'm aware that chronic stress can cause all kinds of skin issues, and it has for me for a long time by making my face crack and peel when I'm super antsy, like before or during a big event with lots of people involved. This seems to worsen for several days and then get better when I'm not worried so much. But the only difference here is that I've had panic attacks now, and I've been out over the edge and fell into a deep state of depersonalization, which is exacerbating my stress levels to extremes, so much so that my brain is cutting off my emotions to try and cope, like an airbag, which is extremely unsettling. 

I'm curious to know if anyone else has experienced this and, if so, what you did about it or if it got better once the stress levels died down. 

Thank you."	Musclesturtle	post	25.301007084584473	female	White	0.012739303521811962	na	na	na	13	stress
I haven't had the type of skin irritation you're describing, but I have had something called dermatographia, where you can basically just lightly scratch the skin and it causes what looks like hives. mine actually flared up recently when I got long covid, and then died down again as some of my stress around that calmed a bit.

My wife had this. Went to multiple doctors and they found nothing. She had been battling chronic stress for months and started getting a sunburn feeling as she explained it. It moved around her body.

Yes. I've had this for 10 years. It started out as the sunburn feeling you're describing (mainly on my forearms and lower legs). With time and repeated episodes of severe anxiety (always accompanied by insomnia), it covered about 75% of my body and progressed to an intense tingling/crawling/burning sensation. I actually have it right now. :( I thought it was a neurological illness, but it really is just the nervous system going haywire. Mine also disappears completely when the stressor is alleviated. I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and panic disorder, as well as somatoform disorder (which is an umbrella term for physical bodily sensations with psychiatric causes).

Funnily enough this is also from long COVID. I was hanging severely elevated stress and anxiety from work before I got COVID, like, the acid reflux from my GERD was 24/7 kind of anxiety. Then I got sick, and COVID bumped my anxiety up one more level, which was just enough to throw me over the edge of the abyss.

another thing I've seen mentioned a lot is MCAS, which I have wondered if I have/if long covid acts similarly by activating mast cells. I haven't tried a low histamine diet yet (which is said to help with the symptoms), but my diet is actually already pretty low histamine. that could also be something to look into!

I've been on an SSRI (Zoloft) for the last 8 months. It helped quite a bit initially, but I've developed a tolerance to it. I'm due to switch to an SNRI but am delaying because the adjustment period is rough. I take clonazepam (tranquiliser) in moderation when things get bad, and that also stops the burning pains immediately. I'm back in therapy as well. CBT unfortunately didn't help.

"I have a mental burnout and slowly I'm getting a bit better.

I gave myself a Garmin fitness watch because I wanted to get into a better physical shape. Part of my burnout is due to lack of physical activity... sitting at a desk all day and not doing any sports or other physical activities before or after work.

I was looking at all the stats and charts. Because I didn't understand what HRV indicated I searched and found this video with explaination:

[How to Analyze Stress from Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwJjwYuJmHA)

I searched this subreddit for HRV and I couldn't find recent posts. So, I thought maybe some of you would be interested that some smart watches and fitness watches have this option, so you can track your stress and recovery.

What I like is that when I meditate the HRV goes up (which is good)... is kind of cool to see the positive effect of mediation in a chart."	Breros	post	32.72849463975025	male	White	0.00929801445454359	na	na	na	6	stress
I understood Hvr as as how your heart was able to ramp up or down depending on the situation it was presented with. As in it was able to speed up if you were running to supply blood to your muscles etc.  And that if it did not go up with the increase demand that that was a problem. There had to be variability.	Breros	reply	na	na	na	0.00929801445454359	no	strong	no	na	stress
Need advice, I'm working to control my stress levels. Will the Garmin watch alert you somehow when stress levels rise and if so can you alter triggers like a certain heart rate ?

"That's correct. But when we stress ourself mentally/emotionally we make cortisol and that puts us into active mode, just like we would be running... but we actually don't run and stop to rest occationally.

So the watch knows we're not active physically but still our heart rate variability is like we're physical active and so it's registered as (mental) stress."	Breros	follow-up	na	na	na	0.00929801445454359	no	no	no	na	stress

The Garmin does give an alert. I actually just look regularly at my watch to look how high my stress level is and take proper precautions. So I haven't had the alert go off yet. Someone mentioned the alert on r/GarminWatches

So it's read continuously.

Most Garmin models just look at the specifications on the Garmin website.

1. Ask for some kind of time or reprieve at school and work. Be open and honest about your condition.
2. Realize you might not just be burned out from stress but from some maladaptive responses to it. This gives you an opportunity to level up your stress management and live easier and more happily.
3. Plan your recovery. Don’t just rest. Recover. Work on your sleep, exercise, your diet, meditation, time in nature. If you get a mere 7% boost from each, you will feel markedly better equipped the next time around.
4. Strategize your comeback. Plan. Be regular about making progress. Keep to the schedule. Get help adhering to it. Get help immediately with any roadblocks. You are resourceful which is why you asked here.

Then, your brain will kick into one of three modes:

A. Worry about the outcome 

B. Think of ways to justify the outcome ( ah it’s gonna be fineeeee)

C. Think about what you need to do now, and do it 

A and B are both going to compound the issue, making the stress even higher. You need to focus on what you need to do, right now.

Just to clarify I don’t have an ED, i love eating and i normally have a healthy relationship with food. Im just so stressed and it feels like an impossible task to feed myself. someone please help.

"Just came here to make a similar post.

&#x200B;

Not a breakup in my case, very stressed for other reasons right now, and can barely eat, I feel nauseous all the time, and feel like vomiting, if i eat a bit too much. I also have dry heaving and vertigo. Went through something similar last year fall. Not to the extent that my hair fell out, but I visibly dropped weight, other people commented on it too. I don't mind the weight loss itself, but I am worried about my health, also because I have problems with low energy levels.

These days I can down only a few types of food, small amounts of 72% black chocolate, potato chips, maybe some rice. The latter two don't really provide much nutrition, but I really cannot down any other kind of food right now. I buy vegetables, but then never reach for them when cooking at home.

I put protein powder and collagen peptide powder in my cocoa/ grain coffee in the morning and evening.

I also thought of nuts/ peanuts, avocados today.

You could try taking some supplements. B-Vitamin complex, Zinc, Calcium and iron (if you're a woman). I am already doing that."	GroundbreakingPin297	reply	na	na	na	0.9985328912734985	no	strong	no	na	stress

"Hello!

I'm someone who always liked to say I never stress. Each time a stressful situation comes, I tend to say ""it's a bummer, but I can deal with this later/take it easy"".

I only realized recently that I have ""invisible"" stress.  What I mean by this is that at first I don't have outward symptoms of stress, I can stay calm and positive. But it's brewing inside. 

Of course,all this unresolved stress just end up overflowing.

Last night was the worse. Woke up feeling like I haven't slept and then realized I had a sleepwalking episode (things weren't in the right place, cupboards open,...)

What should I do with all this pent-up stress? Should I see someone?

How do I deal with stress before it gets too much? How do I recognize the internalized stress?

You said you are ""positive and calm"" but its ""brewing inside"".

Are you being authentic about your emotions or are you brushing it to the side where it's building up and is coming out in ways like sleep walking?

What if something happens and your first reaction is to be pissed- or do you tell yourself you can't?

"Thank you for your answer ( didn't get a notification until today, weirdly enough).

What I mean is that I always give a calm and positive front. I'm so good at it that I even fool myself now. As the oldest of four sisters, I had to take on a more ""motherly"" role. So I learned to keep in frustrations and stress.

I can't cope with negativity and run away from displeasing situations. Only truly realized this recently, though. But it's getting to the point where my stress and negative emotions are taking a toll on my health and psyche. .

What happened recently is that I bought a house, got fired from my job and my car broke down. It's the first time that I had so many bad things happen at once and all that stress can't stay internalized. I tried, tried to keep a positive mind and just let things happen (I can't control everything, so why cry about it?). But then the migraines, IBS and sleep problems started.

As for my daily routine, I feel overwhelmed. I am searching for a new job as well as taking care of the house and cats. I don't really have time for myself, waking up at 5 am and going to sleep at 11pm. I was able to cope when I had a job even though I had less time.

"I can RELATE so hard to what you wrote.

I myself bought a house back in 2019, got my car stolen (THAT WAS INSANE LOL) & got let go because covid. Not at all downplaying your situation but I want to showcase I understand. 

Life is 50/50 sometimes it AMAZING and sometimes it sucks. Faking positivity won't get you out of the situation, but a different perception might. Speaking off personal experience, I get overwhelmed when I look at everything that's going terribly wrong & wanting to fix everything that's going terribly wrong. 

What has been my saving grace is categorizing life into what's the MOST important component to focus on and create a list. I'll show you what I do. 

**Your life currently:**

Loss of job

Broken car 

House payment

Life expenses

**For me, a job would be the most important thing to focus on considering money = freedom.** 

When we focus on everything at once our brain gets overwhelmed. When you are stressed fight or flight kicks in, and then irrational or unproductive thoughts accumulate. 

With anything it takes time & most importantly focus.

**Questions I would ask myself for a job:**

What is the easiest job I can get right now to get money?

How can I apply for jobs?

Can I ask anyone in my circle if their job is hiring?

I personally would just focus on the job and then after that's squared away then move to broken car same kind of process then keep going down the list. Similar to a triage at the hospital. 

**Also, HAVE A GOOD CRY. Let the emotions process through your body.  It doesn't make you weak, it makes you a human being.**

With home life I do the same thing:

List

What's most important

What can wait

THEN I like to take what's important break it down into 5-10 minutes daily because I get focused & I create a routine/ habit, so I never spend HOURS on the house ever.

I hope this helps love and if you are looking for more support message me this is my field of expertise.

"Wow! That's a cool report. What is it and how does it measure stress?

&#x200B;

The simple answer is yes, it's normal to have stress reactions when driving or when with a bunch of screaming kids. Completely normal! And it's a great to start to know that these situations increase your stress. The good news is that it's also normal to train a different response and be more relaxed and focused on the road. 

I teach my intermediate stress management students to practice awareness and relaxation in situations where they notice stress spikes such as in their car, on transport, in the elevator at work, or at their desk. You first develop a practice of deep relaxation through techniques like Progressive Muscle Relaxation or training slowing the breath, along with enhancing awareness through Mindfulness meditation. Then you can take your regular practice into your car on days when you don't feel much stress, and when you are stopped at a traffic light, or in a parking lot, or just getting into your car, you will pause, focus, and deeply relax.   


Practice this repeatedly and daily. When you encounter some stressor on the road, then immediately consciously relax using the same exercise. 

Sometimes a set of slow head and neck stretches (tipping forward chin to chest, gently twist right, gently twist left, left ear down to left shoulder, right ear to shoulder, chin up shoulders pinched) also helps awareness of relief of stress related tension."

"I am a highly sensitive person and noises, sounds, lights etc. drive up my stress because of sensory overload ( so almost anything other than my house heightens my stress LOL)

I think when you go into an environment out of your control our stress is naturally going to go up a bit- but when you are home do you have a routine so unwind from the day?

Look into creating a routine/ritual when you get home. 

It's honestly been TRANSFORMING my life and might help you too. 

This is what I do for example:

Walk in the door, go to the bathroom to shower, I light a candle, I give myself permission to let go of the day and relax for the rest of the night, I blow candle out after I shower.

I’m always stressed out nowadays. I mean I’ve always had depression and anxiety but it has gotten 10x worse just this past year. About 8 months ago now I started having some panic attacks because of a new environment I was living in. I guess these started to cause my heart palpitations (something I didn’t even know about beforehand) I mostly didn’t bother worrying myself about them until they started to come frequently, that’s when I decided to take myself to the er. They did x-rays, blood work, urine tests, all that good stuff. Everything came back normal so they discharged me and sent me on home. The anxiety didn’t stop from there. I would continue to have awful panic attacks that two of them I even assumed they were heart attacks because that’s how bad and painful they were. Doctor did ekg on me and found they were in fact just anxiety attacks. Let me just say the symptoms I’ve had because of these attacks. Dizziness, shortness of breath, palpitations, exhaustion, muscle soreness, a lot more. These symptoms lasted weeks after the bad panic attacks, in fact I still have some of them now. I can honestly say I have a panic disorder so unfortunately for me just about everything can trigger a bad panic attack. Now I am suffering from oversleeping and still being exhausted the moment I wake up. I am nervous about this. Can anybody say they’ve had this happen to them because of anxiety and depression or is this something I should be really concerned over?	eatshitepls	post	27.774481875707238	female	White	0.9956598877906799	na	na	na	16	stress

Thanks for sharing. You were right to go to the doctors and get everything checked out. 

From what you’ve shared, your nervous system is in a sympathetic dominant state, meaning you are in the fight/ flight mode. This state will keep you locked in the stress cycle experiencing all of the symptoms. 

I recommend a daily practice of relaxing your nervous system. This is what was the foundation for me."	eatshitepls	reply	na	na	na	0.9956598877906799	weak	no	no	na	stress

"Hi there, 

Thanks for sharing your story. 

Have you or are are you experiencing burnout? 

I used to have crippling anxiety & depression so much so I could barely leave the house. It's actually the first indicator of burnout which I was around 24 years old. 

It also sounds you might be in a cycle of ""fight or flight"" which can really mess with your sleeping & nervous system. 

Anxiety & depression is your body alerting you that something needs to change.

How is your daily routine?

How do you manage stress?

Whats one thing youre doing for yourself daily?

Also, maybe its worth wild to talk to someone (psychologist)

There might be underlining trauma that needs to be address that is coming out in the form of anxiety & depression as well.

"My best advice for stress -   
  
  
The people who suffer most from stress are those who are most afraid of it. Learning to deal with stress is partly learning not to fear it.  
  
  
Fear is the thing to deal with.  
  
  
When you're worrying, you're not really thinking. You're just spinning your wheels.  
  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
  
  
One of the best things for stress is to develop good breathing habits. It's very simple, although you might find it a bit hard to develop good habits.   
  
  
A really simple but effective thing - the habit of responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath.   
  
The evidence showing that slow breathing is a fast and effective method of calming down is enormous. It's used in treating anxiety, depression, and PTSD (video - the Stanford PTSD study). Soldiers say that they are able to calm down immediately in dangerous situations by simply slowing down their breathing.  
  
Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg recommend this simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, inhale and exhale 6 seconds each.  
  
Rushing around when you don't have to and doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness.   
  
  
Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind. You can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners' videos on YouTube.  
  
  
Other things take some effort but they're very rewarding - things that make your life meaningful, like a good hobby, art, or volunteer work. Take care of your mental and physical health with the right lifestyle choices.  
  
This is one of the articles online with advice for therapeutic comfort -

I also found out that my counseling services was racking up a bill.

Just didn't send the link. Well it was cancelled because my bill is 2k. 

I'm so mad at myself and worried about paying it to continue counseling.  I never got a call, a letter or anything. They never mentioned it when I had called. This would have been easier to deal with when the bill was lower. Now I'm freaking.

From reading your post, you are shifting your life currently, starting a new job that's worth a celebrating. So, CONGRATS on that!

Back to your post, just because you made a mistake doesn't mean money gets to become your identity. 

Your problem right now is not having enough money.

What I do to not get overwhelmed is deal with one bill at a time.

Let's say this bill for counseling- are they able to work with you? 

Are you able to get a credit card out with no interest let's say for 15 months?

Can you make a weekly payment of like 10-20 bucks a week until you can make larger payments?

Do you have any assets? Stocks? 

What kind of little jobs can you do that can make you more money?

Are you able to pick up another job?

How about your job now, when do you get paid?

I would honestly get a piece of paper out and write different ways to make money especially if you feel bad not taking it from your partner. 

When you freak out = no solution

When you are calm & trying to figure it out = solution

Money does NOT define you and I am pretty sure your smart self can figure a way out of this.

How do I accept that my heart palpitations are just a part of my anxiety? I spiral into a panic attack every single time I feel one😭 They are SO beyond scary & each time I get one I feel this impending doom feeling & tell myself that this is it - it’s my time😞 It’s horrendous, how do I accept it’s just anxiety/panic induced & not a health concern?

"Hey pokegirl!

So I have dealt with the palpitations and anxiety for a long time. Anxiety since 17, I'm 26 now and I've had the palpitations for a few years now. They have gotten much better.

For a long while I was getting them every 15-30 min every day. At first they didn't bother me, then like most of us I assume I started reading into it far too much. This lead to constant doctor visits, 3 total ER visits and debilitating anxiety. 

There is someone on YouTube, a specific video but I do not know if I am allowed to post links here. 

Channel name is Paige Pradke, look for a video titled my heart is scaring me.

This single video alongside with using the DARE app which I HIGHLY recommend to anyone with even mild anxiety. Single handedly has helped me take control of my anxiety. I know how you feel I promise I do. 

You must trust the process though and truly want to feel better, and anyone can overcome these scary sensations. 

I really hope these help always feel free to reach out to me if you are down and feeling helpless I wo7ld love to do my best to help.

Panic disorder often responds to self-help. In fact, Handbook of Self-Help Therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that of all the disorders, panic disorder is the one that’s most responsive to self-help.

"this makes so much sense, first of all. palpitations are SO uncomfortable! 

the best advice I have is to get familiar with the sensation and be curious about it. the more familiar you get with it, the less it will scare you. 

next time it happens, try to focus on your breathing for a few breaths. then get curious about the heart palpitations. what do they feel like? where do you feel them most? maybe even try counting them, or noticing how long they last. the first few times of doing this will feel extra scary! and if you can stick with it, over time, you get to know them. once they are familiar to you, you'll start to have thoughts like ""oh, there they go again"" and your natural reaction will be to watch them with curiosity. 

my heart palpitations were especially bad 5 years ago or so. I also got fully checked out and they were deemed harmless. but sometimes I would get a really aggressive one that felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest. by the time those were happening though, I had gotten so familiar with them that even though the intensity startled me at first, I was able to laugh at it shortly after, and it didn't disrupt my day with anxiety or worry.

So I was told that I would get full pay for 4 weeks (20 days) before going onto SSP, I was gone for 24 days which equaled to about 16 work days off. I got signed off with stress which was constant anxiety attacks and the like. Doctor saw this and gave me the time off after telling me I should self certify the first week. So I did, I self certified, I was then given 3 weeks off from the doctor. I came back today to be told because I self certified the first week I'm getting a disciplinary, and that for the previous 6 days off I've had I'm getting SSP for them. I was told that if I had any spikes whilst I'm here I cannot leave the building to go and get fresh air however I can just ""walk around the hallways"", like I've literally come back today and been told this at my back to work meeting and I'm already again spiking with my anxiety really bad, I've been here years now as well...

Slow breathing can help with awkward social situations and phobias.

You can get good and relaxed, then imagine yourself in a situation that makes you nervous.  Doctors recommend a simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, 6 sec inhale and 6 sec exhale.

You can also slow your breathing just before you go up to speak. You can even pause occasionally to take a slow, deep breathing during the speech.

You'll feel better when you've got the first few seconds out of the way.

The audience likes a pleasant disposition. Try to be cheerful.

I am a 21 y/o who just graduated college today. I have pretty serious social anxiety and I’m diagnosed with APD. My whole life I have always filled my schedule to max capacity with coursework and extra curriculars. My senior year of high school I took 4 AP courses and had no lunch period on top of being in multiple after school bands and being on the baseball team. I was so stressed all the time that my hair would get thin and fall out, and my eczema would break out all the way up my arms. Several times I fainted bc of a combination of panic and malnourishment. I told myself that in college I wouldn’t do that to myself again so I made a lot of decisions to lighten my schedule. However, without that stress, especially during the pandemic, I fell into a deep depression. I had too much time with my thoughts. So I went back to old habits. These past two semesters I took a total of 12 courses. In the last 10 days for finals week I had to complete 90+ pages worth of papers. It was total torture. I expected to have a euphoric and untethered feeling once I was finished, but within a few hours I just broke down into tears. So here I am; I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to function without stress in my life. I get that stress to an extent is necessary but I feel like an addict. I feel like I need take on larger and larger ‘doses’ of stress for me to avoid these depressive stages. I don’t feel healthy. I go to therapy but I’m spiraling right now.  Has somebody had a similar experience and would like to talk about it? How do I make my stress more productive? Thanks for any replies!

Stress sucks. I would know after months on months of health anxiety and panic attacks, but one thing I can tell you for sure, is I never miss having a panic attack. I don’t think you are addicted to stress, but your body is so used to you being stressed and having adrenaline pumping throughout your body, that when your not as stressed some days, something feels off, so the body naturally starts to get stressed and your anxiety levels skyrocket. Watch some videos on youtube on people who relate to you on what your stressing about, it helps me not feel so alone in it all, make sure to eat, get ya nutrients, and hang out with some friends is my advice. Not saying you don’t but it helps me take my mind off things. Hope this helps	OstrichDelicious587	reply	na	na	na	0.9983373880386353	no	strong	no	na	stress

"I'll spend the ai tokens on ya....

I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general advice on what you might try to address your excess saliva and jaw pain. If these issues persist or worsen, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and treatment plan. That said, here are a few things you might try:  
  
1. Relax your jaw: Be aware of your jaw position and consciously try to keep it relaxed. When your lips are closed and your teeth are slightly apart, your jaw should be in its most comfortable resting position.  
  
2. Jaw exercises: Gently stretch and strengthen your jaw muscles by opening and closing your mouth, moving your jaw from side to side, and performing neck stretches. Be careful not to overdo it or cause more pain.  
  
3. Apply heat or cold: Use a warm or cold compress on the painful area to help reduce inflammation and alleviate pain. Experiment with both to see which works best for you.  
  
4. Over-the-counter pain relievers: You may consider taking over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, to help manage your pain. Be sure to follow the dosage instructions and consult a healthcare professional if you're unsure.  
  
5. Maintain good posture: Poor posture, particularly while working at a desk, can contribute to jaw and neck pain. Ensure your workstation is ergonomically set up, and take breaks to stand up, stretch, and walk around.  
  
6. Address stress: Stress can lead to jaw clenching and teeth grinding, which can exacerbate jaw pain. Engage in stress-reducing activities such as exercise, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.  
  
7. Sucking on sugar-free candies: Sucking on sugar-free candies or chewing sugar-free gum may help stimulate saliva production and reduce the feeling of excess saliva.  
  
8. Drink water: Staying hydrated may help keep your mouth and throat moist and reduce the sensation of excess saliva.  
  
9. Evaluate your video call habits: Observe your behavior during video calls to identify any habits that may be contributing to your jaw pain and excess saliva. Adjust your position and take breaks as needed.  
  
If your symptoms persist or worsen, it's important to consult a healthcare professional, such as a dentist or doctor, for a proper evaluation and treatment plan.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\> medical reasons for these symptoms

&#x200B;

I am not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about possible medical reasons for your symptoms of excess saliva and jaw pain. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and personalized advice.  
  
Some possible medical causes for these symptoms could include:  
  
1. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders: Dysfunction or inflammation of the temporomandibular joint can cause jaw pain, headaches, and difficulty chewing or speaking.  
  
2. Sialorrhea (excessive drooling): This can be caused by various factors, including neurological disorders, oral infections, or certain medications.  
  
3. Bruxism (teeth grinding): Grinding your teeth, particularly at night, can cause jaw pain, headaches, and dental issues.  
  
4. Trigeminal neuralgia: A chronic pain condition that affects the trigeminal nerve, causing facial pain that may be triggered by everyday activities such as talking or chewing.  
  
5. Dental issues: Tooth decay, gum disease, or dental abscesses can cause pain and discomfort in the jaw and surrounding areas.  
  
6. Sinus infections: Inflammation of the sinuses can cause facial pain, including jaw pain and headaches.  
  
7. Ear infections: Inflammation or infection in the middle ear can cause pain that radiates to the jaw and surrounding areas.  
  
8. Salivary gland issues: Infections, blockages, or tumors in the salivary glands can cause pain and changes in saliva production.  
  
9. Medications: Certain medications can cause an increase in saliva production as a side effect.  
  
10. Neurological disorders: Conditions such as Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, or stroke can cause changes in saliva production and control, as well as difficulties with jaw movement and function.  
  
Again, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional if you're experiencing these symptoms, as they can help determine the cause and recommend appropriate treatment."		reply	na	na	na	0.9973453879356384	weak	no	no	na	stress

"My best advice for stress -   
  
  
The people who suffer most from stress are those who are most afraid of it. Learning to deal with stress is partly learning not to fear it.   
  
  
Fear is the thing to deal with.  
  
  
When you're worrying, you're not really thinking. You're just spinning your wheels.  
  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
  
  
One of the best things for stress is to develop good breathing habits. It's very simple, although you might find it a bit hard to develop good habits.   
  
  
A really simple but effective thing - the habit of responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath.   
  
The evidence showing that slow breathing is a fast and effective method of calming down is enormous. It's used in treating anxiety, depression, and PTSD (video - the Stanford PTSD study). Soldiers say that they are able to calm down immediately in dangerous situations by simply slowing down their breathing.  
  
Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg recommend this simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, inhale and exhale 6 seconds each.  
  
Rushing around when you don't have to and doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness.   
  
  
Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind. You can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners' videos on YouTube.  
  
  
Other things take some effort but they're very rewarding - things that make your life meaningful, like a good hobby, art, or volunteer work. Take care of your mental and physical health with the right lifestyle choices.

I’m so sorry to hear you’re going through this. It sounds like you most defiantly need to regulate his nervous system.  I had to do this for many years and one thing that helped me was finding the right doctor for meds. Mental health is so tough and the work to find the right doc isn’t fun. But with this said it’s looking like you are doing a lot to combat the stress and my recommendation is that you take a break and rest. Doing some tapping to calm down and rest will be good. Finding a way to neutralize the emotions will be really good. I don’t know if you have ever heard of Abraham hicks but there is a you tube video called “ I am sick of my life” that is a beginners guide to regulating emotions. It’s an interview with a woman that is tired of feeling the way she is. Good luck.	BlueberryLast4378	reply	na	na	na	0.9969049096107483	strong	strong	no	na	stress

It’s a constant small worry when I’m with peers due to end of year pressure and making sure things are done right. This can have a knock on effect with overthinking everything and not just coarsework. I over compensate organisation which turns out to be an oversaturated piece of nonsense that does not work. It effects my listening skills and I find it more difficult taking things in as I’m thinking about 3 other things. Then at lunch with peers I’m constantly worrying if I’ve repeated something before or if I’m contradicting myself.

I’ve always had problems with anxiety and depression, but it’s never been this bad. For the last 6-7 months I’ve been dealing with terrible panic attacks and depression that makes none of the symptoms better. I would say that my body is constantly on edge. I get spooked over the smallest things, which in return works my body up and leaves me absolutely drained. I guess what I’m meaning to ask is if it’s possible to be in flight or fight mode 24/7? Lately I have been having terrible fatigue. I can sleep for 11 hours and still feel exhausted, have no energy, and no motivation to do anything. It’s only been a few days since then because usually I’ll stay up all night and sleep during the day and still be tired. Now I’m nervous because I feel like I’m having chronic fatigue and it could literally be anything at this rate. I guess I’m just wondering if anxiety burnout can cause this or maybe my nervous system is messed up from stress?	eatshitepls	post	18.870854679657356	male	White	0.998515784740448	na	na	na	5	stress

It just takes time. You have to live a healthier lifestyle and give your body patience to catch up. You need to go into care and healing mode. It can take people a few years to shake all of the symptoms on the high end. Some people are back to normal after a few weeks, and some take longer. Just be understanding, patient and consistent. Don't get yourself down too much if it seems like you aren't making progress, because it's not about that so much as it is living healthy and in the moment, which will eventually contribute to your recovery.

Tongkat Ali has been shown to be an effective tool for managing stress and preventing burnout. It has been found to reduce cortisol levels, and to reduce the symptoms of depression and anxiety. Additionally, Tongkat Ali can reduce fatigue and increase energy levels, helping to regulate and maintain healthy stress levels. It has also been found to reduce inflammation, which can be a major contributor to stress and burnout. By using Tongkat Ali to help manage stress, one can help to prevent the physical and mental exhaustion that can come with prolonged stress.

It used to be commonly said that cortisol is the ""stress hormone"", now people don't refer to it as much.

I had a pain management doctor, who used to be a nutritionist, tell me that eating too much sugar (or fake sugar/ sugar substitutes) also releases insulin in the body, which turns to cortisol if not enough sugar is present to absorb, or too much is present (the amount of sweetness you taste when eating or drinking tells the body how much to release). I might be remembering that slightly wrong.  But I do recall that either too much or not enough sugar causes it, and cortisol is a big contributor to neck and shoulder tension and pain, as well as belly fat in many people.

ETA what I remember being told doesn't seem to be quite accurate, here is another description of cortisol.

"TL;DR: Friend had bad LSD trip, I sober friend tried calming him down from aggression and stuff. I'mon antideoressants so couldn't cry it feel much negative emotion or anxiety. Feeling stress in my bones but can'fully express it and hurts.

So for context I was basically babysitting some friends that wanted to try LSD. I'm not against drug use but I was suggesting to take lower doses if they were sure about this because I don't want anything bad to happen to them.

Anyway they take their stuff all giggly and saying stupid stuff. Two of the guys absolutely great time was had, just giggles and jokes. Last guy was like that and then he got aggressive, throwing stuff, trying to kill himself, screaming at me and my friends and just ultimately being a threat to us and himself.

Honestly I was just scared and wanted to help him because he is a good friend. So I got him an ambulance and he got taken to the hospital. Have yet to hear from them and everything to say he is alright but fair to say the whole thing stressed me out. 

So I'm on antidepressants and that has really taken a lot of my negative emotions away so when I tell you that I couldn't cry it fucking hurt. I wanted to release some pain after everything that happened. Was having a panic attack I know but the antidepressants were keeping the anxiety in check and fucking with it all.

Anyway I just feel awful about it all and just really fucking stressed about my friends wellbeing."	A_Backup_account_	post	17.69727505051128	female	White	0.9986151456832886	na	na	na	2	stress
"Not to come down on you but you were a horrible choice for a trip sitter. You shouldn't trip sit if you aren't experienced with the drug and don't know how to handle a bad trip situation, which it's clear your didn't. Calling an ambulance was the absolute worst decision and thing you could have done for your friend in that moment. Being on LSD and being taken to a hospital and will only further feelings of psychosis. Which is what your friend was experiencing. LSD creates a sort of temporary psychosis and everyone responds differently. But it isn't harmful and passes within 6-12 hours. Someone experiencing a bad trip needs to feel safe and reassured that everything is ok and he isn't in any danger. They need to feel comfortable and around people they trust. And something as simple as putting on the right music can drastically change their state. I have had quite a few difficult trips and honestly couldn't imagine being taken to a hospital in that state. Not to mention any legal difficulties he may now be facing from the authorities that surely got involved. 

There's not much else you can do now except check on your friend and make sure he's ok. Maybe help him understand what happened a little more. There is tons of literature out there on bad trips and psychedelics in general. If your friend is still struggling, recommend he read many of the great books on the subject. The truth is there isn't really such a thing as a ""bad trip."" Only difficult ones. And often these can be the most illuminating. Having a difficult experience can help you understand a lot about the dark side of your personality and the psyche in general, your shadow self, etc. LSD isn't just a fun giggly drug. It's a full experience with highs and lows, equally transcendent and terrifying, and everyone involved should have known this."

This is really cruel to say and, as someone who has experienced these kinds of drugs, frankly dangerous.   An experience where someone tries to kill themselves is not in the same category as a “difficult trip” and absolutely warrants medical intervention.   I’ve never been to a hospital while in an altered state but know people who have.  They sedate and monitor you while you come down, and where I’m from there are laws protecting people who seek medical care for drug use from getting in legal trouble.

"So here’s a thing that can help you a lot if you are not quite sure where to go in life and you want to have a feeling of inner clarity. Because inner clarity is creating outer clarity.

I myself was struggling for years with this constant feeling of doubt and uncertainty in my chest. I made a few right decisions and was lucky to work with mentors on my mindset and here’s what helped me the most in gaining an inner sense of clarity, peace and serenity. (In most situation, sometimes life hits me in the face very hard as well but that’s part of the game that we somehow happen to be in 😅)

The problem is that we are always looking outside for guidance on how to live our life instead of looking insight and figuring out our own idea of a life worth living. That’s probably nothing new for you but you might ask yourself where to start?

Looking and DEFINING your core values is a great way to do that. I see values as kind of trail markers. Whenever we have to make a decision to make in life and we are not quite sure which path we should go down, we can always look at our values and decide after them. For example if you defined freedom as one of your core values, you want to make decisions that are likely to bring you the most freedom. And that’s what you do on a daily basis.

In that way you’re not only always sure in which direction you want to go, but also you can just give a sh\*t from now on what other people have to say about you because you are a human being that know himself and is sure about himself."	dominik-self-love	post	30.24662420671285	male	White	0.0014857760397717357	na	na	na	1	stress

"I'm not trying to diagnose, but I know of a good source - the dream chapter in Schiraldi.  
  
If you go to the Amazon ad for The PTSD Sourcebook by Dr. Glenn Schiraldi, you'll see from the reader reviews that people with the disorder really appreciate this book, which says that there's a variety of symptoms associated with PTSD, some of which respond to self-help. For example, there's a simple but effective remedy for recurrent nightmares.  
  
It's called imagery rehearsal. The idea is to take things from the dream that bothers you to write a new dream with a happy ending. You take your time to write a really good dream and illustrate it with your artwork. Then, you ""rehearse"" the new dream by imagining it for about 10 minutes at bedtime, followed by a good relaxation exercise. Relaxation: psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg recommend this exercise - breathe gently through the nose, inhale and exhale 6 seconds each. You should feel very relaxed in 5 to 10 minutes.

Tongkat Ali is an herb that has been used for centuries in Southeast Asia to reduce stress and fatigue, improve mood and increase energy levels. It is believed to help the body deal with stress by reducing cortisol levels in the body. This herb helps to balance hormones, improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety. It also helps to boost the immune system and improve overall physical health. By taking Tongkat Ali, you can help to reduce the effects of stress, both mental and physical, and improve your overall well-being.	skinchanted	reply	na	na	na	0.9986814856529236	no	strong	no	na	stress

"I'm only 23, got my first grey hair at 20, and it's spreading all over my head at this point. By the time I'm thirty I'll probably be fully white at this rate. 

I think it's due to stress, I still live with my parents and dropped out of school when CoVID hit. 

My stress is ironically all related to age and having missed my college years, feeling like I'm old and wanting to get those years back, and the gray hairs just reconfirm my already negative perception of myself in that regard. 

It feels like a cycle that I'm stuck in, and it only gets worse every day. I feel fucking awful sometimes, watching my life pass away, not living it. I think the isolation for so many years did a number on my psyche, and I have no idea how to recover."	justonethrownaway	post	25.236249448784353	female	White	0.9979329109191895	na	na	na	6	stress

"I'm 35 and feel the same way sometimes. Talked recently to someone who was 58 and feeling the same. My advice - stop feeling this way immediately. You are exactly where you are supposed to be. The time is NOW to start living the life you want. That is all you have.  Any second spent worrying that you're too old or missed your chance is another second wasted. Seriously, just stop thinking and feeling this way right now. You are in control of your thoughts and emotions. Anytime this thought or feeling comes up, look at it with a smirk and say no more old friend and let it come and go. And just keep doing the things you want to do and living the life you want to live. It's all about progress, even baby steps every day will get you far. Everyone has their own path and speed. You're so young and can literally do anything. Focus on the things you have accomplished, not the things you haven't. Then make progress from a state of accomplishment and gratitude. 

How would you feel if you let more years or decades or maybe even your whole life pass you by and you didn't do the things you wanted to do? Trust me, at 35, 50, 80, and the end of your life, you will look back at when you were 23 and realize how much opportunity you really had and how silly it was to think and feel this way. Make sure you look back totally stoked on your life and now filled with regret. 

Absolutely nothing wrong with feeling this way. Most of us do at times. But what matters is how you respond to your feelings. Do you let them control you or do you control them?"	justonethrownaway	reply	na	na	na	0.9979329109191895	weak	strong	no	na	stress

"Happy to help man. Honestly you should feel grateful that you are having these feelings at your age. At 23 I wasn't really thinking too much about my future and acted from a place like I would be young forever. The years go by quick!

My recommendation - do a Tony Robbins seminar. Whether it's virtual or in person, or even one of the free virtual ones he does once a year. I just did one and it completely changed my life and set me on a clear path towards a better future. It will help you in so many ways.

Your tutor will have seen it all. If you’re feeling stressed you need to talk to them so they can support you. You may be able to get an extension for example, but if you don’t say anything and just don’t hand you work in they can’t do anything.

"I don't know, honestly I'm kinda ranting but. Is it just me or is school really stressful? Because sure, the learning itself is a bit stressful, when you keep failing its really stressful, but like, applying to schools is really stressful for me. Because my test scores were 1260 (SAT, both times) and 20 (ACT) but when I look at schools to apply to it seems like all the ones that would be good for me are 1300s. And then I did this thing for high school where I went to a local community College (fairly large and even has some bachelor's degrees so from what I understand it's up there in community Colleges) for my last two years. But it was all ""smart"" kids, like smart smart, and we took 4 classes every semester and 3 in the summer and did it through the pandemic and everyone, I mean everyone *EXCEPT* me passed with an AA degree too, they all went to (as far as I know) other colleges and universities, at least 2 going to ivy league but others probably got in I don't know of. And when I look it just stresses me the f**k out. I'm 19 now I graduated June 2022 and didn't do anything summer and fall then started back to get my AA (associates of arts) degree by this summer (assuming I can pass my math class). And I just keep comparing myself to all my other class mates who are off and passed and doing this b*lls*it called adulthood and its just freaking me out. I'm late but I'm trying to apply for colleges again but it's like, I can't escape my state (Florida, who wouldn't want to escape?) because if I'm not going to go to some (at least somewhat) prestigious school why should I leave?

"I’m sorry you are going through this.  My personal advice would be to think about what career field you are interested and try speaking to people in those areas, specifically asking about jobs where workers are in high demand and what those jobs are actually like.  Then you can tailor your education needs to those goals versus just trying to get into the “best” or most prestigious school that will take you in. 

A lot of people get education for its own sake, which isn’t bad per se, but can result in a LOT of debt without corresponding opportunities or being trapped in a niche area of work that actually doesn’t suit your needs or interests. 

In the meantime, cut yourself some slack, and remember self care to help mitigate your stress.   You are only 19 and you have plenty of time to figure things out."	zuckz	reply	na	na	na	0.9979846477508545	strong	no	no	na	stress
"Hi. I’m just kind of seeking advice right now, so any help would be much appreciated. Just an opinion would be of help.
Sincere replies please and thank you. 

Due to burnout and certain issues at home, my everyday life has become increasingly toxic and suffocating to the point I find it difficult to breathe because of the stress and worries I feel nearly everyday. I’m not being treated very badly or anything and my teachers are fine, so it isn’t that. Its only been like this for half a year. It’s just, a family member I care VERY much about is severely sick and has been for awhile. We finally found a supposedly good antibiotic for her and we’re waiting for it to arrive.  Unfortunately, she’s still very young and picky, so there’s a lot she absolutely refuses to eat. Thanks to that, it’s a struggle to find food for her. We aren’t poor but we aren’t rich either. She’s so picky to the point she won’t eat almost everything she can anymore. 

My mother is sick and I’m fatherless. It’s just us four at home. Me, my mother, my grandfather, and her. My mother is quite ill, so I have to sometimes help take care of her as well. I’m not too worried about her since she’ll go to the hospital soon and she has her medication, so it’s okay. My grandfather won’t help out and I can’t trust he won’t hurt her when I’m not paying attention, so I often have to take care of her. 

I have to feed her every few hours and for many meals, I have to cook it. That’s right, I have to cook her meals for a good period of time. 
She’ll rebel a bunch and I have to clean up after her. Still, I know she’s trying to be good. Other than food, she’s usually a good girl. She doesn’t constantly cry and whine unlike a lot of other children her age, so I do appreciate that. I love her too much to hire a babysitter that may not take good care of her. 

Those are just the problems at home. I have assignments to do and school to attend. Thankfully, I go to school virtually so I can still take of her while listening to my lessons. However, it is incredibly tiring even with my mother trying to help out. My health isn’t in shambles, but my mental health isn’t that great and hasn’t been for a long time. Constantly babysitting and going to school while dealing with the bullshit at home is extremely suffocating. Call me weak if you want, but that’s honestly just too much for me. 

The stress and constant getting up to take care of her has made it impossible to focus on work. 
With the working building up, the pressure and stress are just increasing. I can’t really talk to my teachers about this either. 
I have no idea what to do and I think that’s pretty obvious to the people around me. I don’t mean to, I try not to, but I can’t help losing my temper when I’m sleep deprived and overly stressed. I don’t know what to do. Exams are coming up and I really need to start working harder on my assignments, so the pressure is killing me. I don’t know what to do. If I had to pick, I’d rather take care of her and nurse her to full health first before caring about school, but I care about school too. I want to do well, not for my family, but for myself. 

Again, any help would be appreciated. Thank you."	Original-Cellist4181	post	25.513450505993717	female	White	0.022995300590991974	na	na	na	2	stress
"Is it possible to cut your class enrollments and consider summer school to make up the reduction?  At least it spreads your workload out a bit more.  Is it possible to take “easier” non-essential for your major electives that would help you de-stress?  Like some type of musical studies course or something like that. 

I would also consider relaying a very non-specific, high-level overview of your circumstances to your professors and ask what options are available for you.

Also, your school may offer complimentary social services or mental health services you can take advantage of for free.

Your sick parent’s health is no doubt stressful.  Your own health has to take priority though.

Also, when you do have a moment for yourself, do some coloring books or draw or anything that will focus your attention to a task that isn’t mentally or physically taxing."	Original-Cellist4181	reply	na	na	na	0.022995300590991974	no	no	strong	na	stress
"It should be possible. I’m not too sure how I feel about summer school instead, but it might help, thank you. I’ll give it some consideration. 
Unfortunately, I don’t think it is. I’m currently still a Freshman. 

I would, but since I haven’t been in active in handing in work, I don’t think they’ll be too keen on talking to me. 
I’ve tried reaching out to teachers before, but whenever I do, I would end up being too honest and they’d end up thinking I was lying and making things up to get out of work, which really isn’t the case. Any more words involved and I’m making excuses. Even my mother doesn’t believe me when I tell her I’m stressed and my mental health is going down the drain, so I highly doubt my teachers will especially with my mother obviously disagreeing. 

They might, but from what I’ve heard, they can be extremely strict. I’ve been told that sometimes, health counselors will come to your house and watch you while instructing you what to do if your mental health is bad enough. I don’t think that would work very well with either me or my mother, unfortunately. 

Thank you. 
Thank you. I do try to, but whenever I start working again, I immediately feel exhausted as if I never had a break to begin with. I do appreciate the help and advice though, thank you a lot. It’s much appreciated."	Original-Cellist4181	follow-up	na	na	na	0.022995300590991974	weak	no	no	na	stress

hi I know I'm late but I just want to say I hate that feeling. I honestly think the best method is distraction and comfort. you gotta get yourself into the comfiest possible position that you can fall asleep in, focus on how comfy you are, and distract yourself somehow i.e. counting back from 10,000, making up a little story in your head, imagining some scenario that isn't distressing or exciting, or listening to something that makes you sleepy. pushing yourself to sleep will only make it harder	Emetephobic	reply	na	na	na	0.9994739890098572	no	strong	no	na	stress

Your brain needs breaks to process information. What helped me study when I was in college was reading a section, really understanding it (I paraphrase in my own words what I just read), then taking about a 10-20 minute break to let my brain process the information.

"I have a seemingly light problem

I am hypersensitive to smells or sensitive to chemicals. I am like this since my teenage years, but I  feel like my symptoms got worse. For this reason example, nobody is allowed to cook any pork in the house, and luckily my wife was okay with this, but even when he sometimes eats bacon and he sweat after that the smell is extremely unpleasant.

Now I can't stay in one closed place with someone smelly, because I literally got sick. First my nose and eyes start to itch, I got nauseous, and tear up, my nose start to run. Even after removing myself from the smell, my  symptoms just slowly disappears. And during those years if I remember the time I was affected by the smell, I hallucinate the smell vividly...

I used to cough for years because I lived in a city, and now that I moved to the countryside with plenty of forests and lakes and pine trees, I was symptom-less.... but then I went to a language course and the hall was smelling like unwashed ass and armpit because some people were not using deodorant or I don't know. I realized I can't run away from bad smells, so how can I adjust myself? I used to smoke in the past, and during those times, my smelling sense was reduced to a normal level.

Medicine may assist with long term effects if you struggle with those aliments and your primary care doctor can defiantly work with you on identifying triggers/plans for how to deal with.

"This is probably the wrong place to put this but I really just need to tell someone.

I’m currently in my first year of uni doing a bachelors degree, I’ve never been great a school, especially at maths or calculations. My degree requires me to do biology and chemistry fundamentals. 

We recently had an exam based on the first 3 lab practicals we did, where we have a lab manual we fill out and are able to take into the exams as a resource, and we’re even told that 75% of the exam was already in the lab Prac manual we filled out.

I went into the exam feeling nervous but believing that I had a decent grasp of the content and understanding of the calculations and equations.

I truly believed that I had gotten at least a 60-70% grade mark, we had received our marks back today, I got 30%, I didn’t even get a passing grade.

Finding this out after working my ass off studying and practicing and reviewing and I got 30%, I feel like an idiot for believing I knew what I was doing, this has just destroyed my confidence in myself after trying so hard to build it up since starting uni.

If I failed my first exam that I was confident in (that people keep telling me isn’t worth very much for the final grade) how the hell am I supposed to do any of this.

He's been distant and there's just been this weird tension. I can't force him to communicate if he doesn't want too, I'll just wait but the negative tension is also affecting me. Same day, I downloaded this art software that took me 3 hours to figure out on my computer and once it was done I realised that my pen for my tablet is broken so I had to buy a new one. 

Second, when I went to go pick up my daughter in the next morning, there was a huge bug in her room, mind you I have a phobia of bugs. Later on in the day I realised there's either a leak or a busted pipe underneath my kitchen sink cause I noticed this huge puddle when I was washing the dishes so I had to order food. I didn't want to order food cause I've been ordering a lot lately due to my depression that I'm trying to maintain with therapy but now I'm going to have to order food till my landlord actually gets someone here to fix the pipe. And on top of that I just have this constant fear that the landlord will put the blame on me and that I'll have to pay for the damages or get evicted. 

ANYWAYS, I just been going through a lot and needed to vent. Mentally I'm not good and have been dissocaiting but what more can I do then to keep trying to survive."		post	28.448410949599854	female	White	0.9974715709686279	na	na	na	1	stress
"I’m real sorry you’re going through this. Chaos is a ladder. If you are going through contrast you then can know what you do want. The awareness of having enough shows that you are ready to make changes but the decision will be yours to make if you follow through. You are deserving of having a life with less stress. 

Things can feel even more elevated with hormones as you mentioned. I want you to know that you are good exactly as you are today in this moment. 

If you can grab a few techniques to slow down and chill out you’ll be able to see the way out."		reply	na	na	na	0.9974715709686279	strong	no	no	na	stress

I’m sorry you’re going through this. The awareness of what you are doing is a big deal and is good.

"Like the earlier commenter, it is great that you recognize the effects of your stress on your body.  I highly recommend you talk to a therapist, if you can, stress like that is not only causing those behaviors, but I would guess (non-professionally) that your body is bearing the brunt of stress internally.

There are things you can do/learn/be that assist in stress.  I won't suggest anything specifically, but people use exercise, distraction, hobbies, behavior changes... you need to find what works for you.  Much affection from afar."

"Sometimes just making a plan of action, however small, makes me feel better.  Like my plan could be on Monday call my insurance company to find out what therapist they recommend.  Tuesday, I make calls to find an appointment, blah blah blah.  

I was clinically obese at one time.  I joined a gym one day.  The *next* day, I went to the gym and spent 3 minutes on the treadmill - walking.  The next day it was 5 minutes, then I worked my way up to 60 minutes and eventually lost 50 lbs.  Lowered my blood pressure and was no longer considered obese.  I still struggle with the last stubborn 30 lbs. 

Baby steps work for some people... especially for me.  My husband is an All American Athelete - good for him.  When I start small with something, but I stick with it, I consider it a win.  When he sees me start a cycling program, I may go for 15 minutes the first day and he has seriously asked me what I expect to get out of 15 minutes.  Over time he sees I am playing the long-game and 15 minutes can turn into 2 hours. If I started at 1-2 hours, I would feel sore and quit.

"For the past 7 years I have been going through this weird mental health thing and I had no idea what was wrong with me. I didn’t exactly align with any of the regular disorders like ADD or anxiety. I knew something was very very wrong with me, I wasn’t functioning at all. I came across the term “chronic stress” and it’s exactly what I have. I wanted to describe how my chronic stress felt to me to see if others have had the same thing.

-feeling like I was in the midst of a white dog like the movie “The Mist”. People would talk to me but I felt they were in the fog and so far away, even if right next to me.

-never being able to be present

-not feeling in my body, like my arms and legs weren’t mine

I work a demanding job where I essentially do 3 jobs in 1. I usually feel so drained after work and the weekends just never come soon enough. I've been a drummer my whole life, and having that creative outlet has always been hugely helpful for me. But, even despite how passionate I am about playing, as my job has gotten more demanding lately, I often find that I just don't have the energy or motivation after a work day to play.

"Hi 👋 

In my case I was stressed and anxious and just getting through a day would give me more stress. All I wanted to do was to get home. 

I realized I had to get my self in a better place when I went to work, because life just became a stress cycle.

I started a daily foundation of down regulating my nervous system and then once I was in a calmer place practices stress resilience and leaning into stress in controlled settings.

All this made me deal with stress and work better which then have me more energy and focus for my hobbies etc.

"I am feeling incredibly stressed about my future. I recently graduated and am currently unemployed, and finding work online has been a real challenge. I know I'm not alone in this situation, but it's hard not to feel overwhelmed by the uncertainty of it all.

To cope with this stress, I've been trying to break the job hunting process into smaller, more manageable steps. This includes updating my resume, searching for job openings, and networking with others in my field. By focusing on these smaller tasks, I feel like I'm making progress, which helps to reduce my overall stress levels.

I'm also trying to take care of myself both physically and mentally during this time. Eating well, exercising, and getting enough sleep are all important for my well-being. I'm also trying out relaxation techniques like deep breathing and meditation to help me calm my mind when I feel particularly anxious.

Despite all of these efforts, there are still times when I feel overwhelmed and stressed out. During those moments, I try to reach out to friends and family for support. Sometimes just talking about my stress with someone who understands can make a big difference.

Ultimately, I know that this is just a temporary setback. I am determined to keep pushing forward and find the job that's right for me. It won't be easy, but I know that with perseverance and a positive attitude, I can make it happen.

If you're feeling stressed about your future, know that you're not alone. Take it one step at a time, take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to seek support when you need it. We'll get through this together!"	tonnyseko	post	22.45362213675567	female	White	0.0016484783263877034	na	na	na	3	stress

Danica McKellar has written best-sellers like Math Doesn't Suck. Another good book - How to Double Your Child's Grades by Eugene Schwartz. Course guides like Cliffs Algebra I are better than textbooks - they have to be for students to buy them. Buy a few for a course, use the best one for explanations and the others for practice with problems.  
  
*With math, it's all about practice.* A site that gives you LOADS of problems to practice with is IXL. It's not cheap, but you can get free problems.  
  
Courses like History are like orchards where you can pick all the fruit you want. Math is a jungle where you have to stay close to the guide and never get lost. Pay close attention during the math lecture from start to finish. Keep a good notebook so you can trade notes with another good student if you miss a day.  
  
Learning algebra is learning to use tools. If you spend a lot of time learning one tool, it's time well spent.  
  
Think in terms of examples and visualize. It often helps to draw little pictures in your notes, or on your test paper.  
  
Word problems aren't as hard as they seem. The teacher can't hide a lot of information into a word problem, which means that any new information you find is probably the answer, or a form of the answer, like a number of feet per second, which you can convert to miles per hour. If you don't know how to solve the problem, play around with it until you get some new number."	Jj_cj	reply	na	na	na	0.9994286894798279	no	no	no	na	stress

"Yes for sure. Everybody has experienced eustress.
We difference distress (negativ) and eustress (positiv). The outcome depends on the mental positioning to the stressor (stressing situation).
For example: you have to do a task in a hobby. Lets say you do martial arts and your coach says you have to run some kilometers for cardiotraining. you can either think; this is to hard and I don't want to do it but I have to(this is a distress-situation) , or you can think; yes, I will do this and it will be a challange to optimize my self.( this is an eustress-situation).
At both scenarios you produce the same stresshormones, but the feeling to the task decides if it pulls you down or pushs you up. Something as small as a mindset-change can help you to deal with your stress on an incredible level."	r_jenkins1	reply	na	na	na	0.9975072741508484	no	strong	no	na	stress

I was stressed and felt overburdened at the office and most of the time felt aggressive as well. It seemed normal to me and many of us feel the same this way. After a few years I thought “No, it is right to feel stressed, angry and overburdened this way and I had to learn to control my mind”. I wanted things to happen smoothly and wanted to handle difficult situations calmly and in a polite manner. I opted for Manochikitsa online therapy service while I hadn’t any serious mental disorder. So, it’s fine to seek help and sort out things by talking to your therapist or psychologist. It’s not a shameful act but a brilliant decision. I recommend Manochikitsa for therapy.

"1. Get physical exercise: Exercise releases endorphins, which helps to reduce stress and lift your mood. Even just a few minutes of exercise each day can make a big difference.  
  
2. Eat well: Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help to keep your mood steady and reduce stress. Avoid comfort eating, which can make you feel worse.  
  
3. Talk to someone: Talking to a trusted friend or family member can help you to express your worries and get perspective on your situation.

I’ve been trying to lose weight for the past few months but the thing is whenever I’m stressed out about something I start stress eating or walking, but seem to eat most of the time. Is there any way I can control this?	ioverthinksomuch	post	8.358337213364074	male	White	0.9975098371505737	na	na	na	3	stress
"When you say stress eating, do you mean mindlessly eat large quantities? That is what my stress eating was like, was binge eating.  I would eat regardless of not being hungry, and continue to eat well after I was full.

Here's what worked for me: 

Don't buy things you stress eat. Throw away/ give away all of the things you normally stress eat or may stress eat (I had to do this). Don't hold on to it saying 'oh I'll take this to such and such' though, honestly, it's best to just toss it, at that point. It is a temptation and you might just eat it out of the 'donation' box before it goes away.

Don't buy more foods you are likely to mindlessly eat when stressed. Walk away from the sales. Don't go down the aisles at all, for a while. The cravings will lessen after a couple to a few weeks, and more after that.

When making meals, portion yourself a reasonable amount (one actual serving size is best) and put up the rest. If going out to eat, ask for them to bring a to-go box before you get your food, and box up the excessive amount before you start eating (many places serve meals well beyond what is a normal, healthy serving, and then people get appetizers and dessert in addition).

If you feel the need to eat and are going crazy, snack on veggies with very very minimal or no dressing (super caloric, not healthy), or have a salad with a little bit of a vinaigrette, or just a tiny bit of oil and balsamic vinegar.  

Tracking *everything* I consumed was helpful to me, bc if I knew I had to log it, I didn't want to eat it as much.

Also, drinking water helps you feel more full, and sometimes we perceive thirst as hunger.  

Bonus tip I got from a nutritionist turned doctor: Mastication is the first step of digestion; it tells your body how full you should feel in addition to breaking down the food.  The better you chew food, the more full you feel. Also, foods that require more chewing will often make you feel more full."	ioverthinksomuch	reply	na	na	na	0.9975098371505737	no	strong	no	na	stress

"  
  
My best advice for stress here, but first this beach video -   
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIYiGA\_rIls  
  
  
The people who suffer most from stress are those who are most afraid of it. Learning to deal with stress is partly learning not to fear it.  
  
  
Fear is the thing to deal with.  
  
  
When you're worrying, you're not really thinking. You're just spinning your wheels.  
  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
  
  
One of the best things for stress is to develop good breathing habits. It's very simple, although you might find it a bit hard to develop good habits.   
  
  
A really simple but effective thing - the habit of responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath.   
  
The evidence showing that slow breathing is a fast and effective method of calming down is enormous. It's used in treating anxiety, depression, and PTSD (video - the Stanford PTSD study). Soldiers say that they are able to calm down immediately in dangerous situations by simply slowing down their breathing.  
  
Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg recommend this simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, inhale and exhale 6 seconds each.  
  
Rushing around when you don't have to and doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness.   
  
  
Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind. You can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners' videos on YouTube.  
  
  
Other things take some effort but they're very rewarding - things that make your life meaningful, like a good hobby, art, or volunteer work. Take care of your mental and physical health with the right lifestyle choices.  
  
This is one of the articles online with advice for therapeutic comfort -  
  
  
https://psychcentral.com/blog/13-healthy-ways-to-comfort-yourself#2  
  
  
The best stress management is personal. Deal with things that are stressing you.  
  
  
This has lots of useful information, including the lifestyle program for stress and depression developed at the Univ of Kansas.

"This technique helped me to develop awareness of my thoughts and feelings as observer. Also it helped me to heal my anxiety and neurosis. I call this “Back of head method”. I hope you try it and it works.

If your attempt was successful and you started feeling calmness and ease, i recommend you to regularly practice this method for months to get good results. You won’t even recognize your reaction to impulses after long practice."	Karandax	post	25.031586851645447	male	White	0.001160626532509923	na	na	na	1	stress

"I’m starting a new job with a new company next week and there is a possibility that someone I know may also have a job there.

This person and I used to work together, she was always a challenging person for me to connect to and I have always felt uneasy with her. This maybe  is due to her being loud, over opinionated and generally took advantage of other employees who did the work whilst she didn’t as they did not want to get on her wrong side.

Due to circumstances beyond my control, our relationship deteriorated very badly(this was three years a go) and she tried to discredit me and it was a very stressful and difficult time.

I have tried to find some info on her and to see her intentions of getting this job, but nothing.

I feel ashamed as a grown woman that I feel scared of her being there. I’m needing this job due to dire financial issues and I want it all to go as well as possible."	Kitchen_Teaching3900	post	44.297636362926056	female	White	0.9976944327354431	na	na	na	1	stress

Hi, everyone! This is my first post here, in fact, its my first post on reddit. The fact is, I have been extremely stressed over my work and I can't get my office out of my brain even when I am asleep. I am a banker and I work around 8/10 hours a day. I try to have fun after office, read books or hang out with friends but whatever I try to do, I can't concentrate into anything at all. I keep listening to people talk but it feels like their words are just sliding down my body and nothing is entering into my ears. I am also having visual difficulty and I can't find proper words while speaking. What could be the possible remedies to manage this kind of stress?

"A new job. 

But more realistically, therapy could probably help. You're having some boundary issues with yourself. You might have lost a bit of your identity to your work and are associating your worth with how well/bad you perform at your job. Disconnecting from work can be difficult, but when it's almost impossible, you're either experiencing burnout or on the fast track to it. 

Ultimately, depending on what the main stressor at work it (a bad manager, unmanageable caseload, toxic work culture), it might be worth it to look into a transfer to a new position or finding a different company who has a more friendly work-life balance."

Hey everyone. Looking for a little feedback regarding neurological impacts on the body from stress. I've recently had multiple doctors visits within the past few months regarding some medical issues I'm going through. This includes most nerve pain in Leg and arm and as of recently headaches and some eye pain/visual disturbances and I've seen a neurologist, pulmonary doctor, cardiologist, RA doc, etc. All test to date have come back as normal/healthy with the exception of a deficient Vitamin D level (22) and low B12 level (350). I'm not certain that these things have made such an impact in a way to be going through what I'm going through, but wanted to know more about what impacts stress can have on the nervous system. With everything that's been going on I've been extremely stressed, with worrying about my health majority of the day. Can stress cause prolonged headaches and eye issues? I'd like to hear feedback from others about your experiences and how long you went through this. I'd also like to hear more about how you were able to official rule out medical diagnosis as a concern and rule it all as stress related.

"The answer is yes stress is a part of alarm system in your body that in evolution keeps you safe the problem is that many of us have been taught to stress about every single aspect of life where your stress arises all day. This behavior makes our body produce hormones that at high levels can hurt us. For example cortisol at one point in my life I couldn’t even walk some days because of pain in my feet. In 2020 I decided to stress less and by 2022 I finally took a whole year to slow down and regain some insight why I was stressing so much. I can walk and no pain in my feet I also have cool news that my eye doctor appt my eyesight improved. That has never happen to me. I didn’t tell my eye doctor about lowering stress levels but asked her how this happens and is possible and she said often times it’s less stress. Honestly I was in an out of doctors for years with little to no help. It was my acupuncturist who helped. People think it’s nonsense. I can assure you it’s not. I had high blood pressure and vertigo and shingles at one point. I’m only 40 when I got shingles. Your body is screaming at you for change and to slow down to gain perceptive when your body is being effected. There are doctors that will intuitively know what needs to happen if you can find them . I think the cure to stress is within yourself. 

I now help and teach others how to stress less with my improved way of life. I don’t want people to go through what I did. 

Good luck to you. Being on here and asking shows that you want to make improvements and they are coming to you."	Level_Section_1035	reply	na	na	na	0.0058086588978767395	no	no	no	na	stress

" Stress is a normal part of life, and it can be healthy or unhealthy depending on the context and how it is managed. Healthy stress, also known as eustress, is a type of stress that is motivating and energizing. It helps us to focus on a task and perform at our best. It can also be beneficial in small doses as it can help us to learn and grow. On the other hand, unhealthy stress, also known as distress, can have negative effects on our physical and mental health if it is not managed properly.

Unhealthy stress can stem from a variety of sources such as work, relationships, and personal challenges. It can lead to physical symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and muscle tension, and mental symptoms such as anxiety and depression. Chronic stress can also lead to more serious health problems such as heart disease and diabetes.

One of the key differences between healthy and unhealthy stress is the duration and intensity of the stress. Healthy stress is typically short-lived and manageable, while unhealthy stress is prolonged and overwhelming. Additionally, healthy stress is often related to a specific event or goal, while unhealthy stress is often related to ongoing issues or problems.

I just can understand when reading text book or listen to another peoples, but it not like I gonna understand all of it.

My mental health in past already a mess but now it worse more, I still not have any mental illness but my emotions not ok. My physical also bad too, Intestinal problems, muscle pain, headache, and stay up late.

Missed plans, fading relationships, confused thoughts, and assignments not finishi. Sometimes pieces of the past come back, things I used to ignore and think it doesn't affect me.  but now, looking back on it, it made me realize it wasn't that simple.  Sometimes I have mixed feelings for someone because of the past, I don't remember what they used to do but I do remember how they made me feel. 

I don’t hold back from crying anymore, I know it's hard to comfort me, I know there's no use crying, I know that even though science proves that crying can soothe us, even after crying, everything  becomes heavier or for the better, nothing changes, the light is still heavy in my eyes, the heavy is still light in my mouth.

"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings so openly. It's clear that you're going through a challenging time, and it's important to remember that it's okay to feel overwhelmed or uncertain. You're not alone in this journey, and many people face similar struggles, especially when adapting to a new culture and language.

It's commendable that you're making an effort to learn English and express yourself in a foreign language, despite the challenges it presents. Remember that language learning takes time, and it's normal to feel frustrated or self-conscious at times. Keep practicing and seeking out opportunities to improve, and don't be afraid to make mistakes.

As for your mental and physical health, it's important to take care of yourself. Speak to a medical professional about your physical symptoms and consider seeking counseling or therapy to help with your emotional well-being. Establishing a support network of friends, family, or community members can also provide comfort and guidance during difficult times.

Lastly, remember that it's okay to feel vulnerable and to seek help when needed. You're going through a significant period of growth and change, and it's essential to be patient and compassionate with yourself. Tomorrow will come, and each day brings new opportunities to learn, grow, and face life's challenges. Keep believing in yourself, and know that you're not alone in this journey."

"Beautiful post. If you don't mind, I'd like to share my personal view on that.

Seek to become a beam of light so frustrations or daily chores can flow through you, and not in you. You don't have to internalize anything. You absolutely need this time for yourself. It's when you reset, purify and lubricate your machine, which is the basis of everything. Your kids need that supermom or superdad to be in their best state to train them and teach them how to be good human beings. I know how you feel.

Remember, for your kids to have an amazing mom, there has to be an amazing mom there in the first place. Take time for yourself, meditate, pray to your most inner light and strength. Turn off your machine. Reset.  Play some meditation music and surrender. You will be reenergized.

"I had a very stressful 2020 that had many things happen to me. I used to get a full head, weird dream like feeling every other week at the start of the year and that slowly developed into a 24/7 by the end of 2020 as the stressful and anxiety events kept happening. Woke up feeling unrested, hair fell out more than usual, vivid dreams everyday that were mostly negative if not nightmares, feeling poisoned when waking up, eyes felt like they didn't want to open when I woke up they were so heavy. The pressure like feeling in my head didn't feel like a headache or hurt at all, it was just a weird, constant feeling. Seem to get more tolerable by the time I had to go to bed. It did seem to get worse when I needed to really focus on things or use my brain heavily. 

Well, I got many tests done from 2020-2021. MRIs, MRAs, blood work, ultrasound, all kinds. Everything normal. Nothing explained my head pressure, full head feeling that never went away. I eventually developed sub-clinical hypothyroidism by end of 2021. No family history. I noticed as time went on the pressure in my head got worse at times. All I did was stay in my home since 2020. Besides playing games and eating as clean as I could, I did nothing else. By end of 2022 December I noticed my head pressure was getting even worse and had headaches that followed. Just felt like my brain was injured or something. Headaches never followed the pressure at it's worst but now it was, and finally during episode of this on December it was particularly bad my head just jerked. My head now has been jerking subtley on it's own ever since and the pressure is still there

Psychiatrist couldn't tell me if chronic, untreated stress can cause this or if it's even anxiety yet wants me to take antidepressants. Neuro examined me and quickly pass it off as stress. No imaging. I am having a hard time finding others on Reddit who have had something similar happen to them.

"If anybody asked me  for a list of things that are good for stress, meditation would be nowhere near the top of the list.  
  
It's not that meditation is no good. Sure - it helps people. But it takes time to learn.   
  
One reason why meditation helps is that it usually involves slow breathing, which is effective and very, very easy.  
  
 My best advice for stress -   
  
  
The people who suffer most from stress are those who are most afraid of it. Learning to deal with stress is partly learning not to fear it.  
  
  
Fear is the thing to deal with.  
  
  
When you're worrying, you're not really thinking. You're just spinning your wheels.  
  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
  
  
One of the best things for stress is to develop good breathing habits. It's very simple, although you might find it a bit hard to develop good habits.   
  
  
A really simple but effective thing - the habit of responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath.   
  
The evidence showing that slow breathing is a fast and effective method of calming down is enormous. It's used in treating anxiety, depression, and PTSD (video - the Stanford PTSD study). Soldiers say that they are able to calm down immediately in dangerous situations by simply slowing down their breathing.  
  
Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg recommend this simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, inhale and exhale 6 seconds each.  
  
Rushing around when you don't have to and doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness.   
  
  
Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind. You can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners' videos on YouTube.  
  
  
Other things take some effort but they're very rewarding - things that make your life meaningful, like a good hobby, art, or volunteer work. Take care of your mental and physical health with the right lifestyle choices.

"Hi everyone!

Every time I feel stressed out by something, I get sick immediately. Usually its just a cold (or IBS), but this time its pretty bad, I got a viral gastroenteritis, because there  were some work related things in the past few weeks, that were stressing me out A LOT. 

This only happens in winter, but yeah, it happens. 
It's like whenever I feel stressed, my body gives in, decides to go on a strike, to give my mind the rest, it subconsciously craves. However, I can not just dissappear from work, whenever it gets busy. Also for the sake of my finances. 
I had to cancel a couple of work gigs over the weekend due to the current gastroenteritis, but I was really counting on that money.

But first be mindful that you are REteaching your body, so it takes time.

However some improvements can even be immediate.

Understand that your **Default Mode is HEALTH** and not sickness. Otherwise, none of us would be here, and we wouldn't have made as a species.

So what you're doing is actually getting back to **DEFAULT MODE.**

How do you do that?

\- Meditating \[make your body used to SAFETY and not THREAT. Do this when your brain is slower - first thing in the morning, last thing before bed - so it reprograms faster\]

**Eliminate TOXICITY** from your life - destructive habits, toxic emotions, toxic people, toxic environments

I actually just did that- I have several part time jobs, and quit the one that is full of toxic people this week....

I think that made my body collapse now. But I hope I will get used to it, eventually lol.

Meditation has been on my mind for a very long time. I know there are many videos on youtube and apps, but I find it impossible to relax inside my home.  
I just forced myself to go to the park and relax a bit there (deep breathing, affirmations, etc) , even though I still felt dizzy and still had a headache, but I definitely feel better now.

"Practical Ways to end your stress:

\- cut caffeine at least 8/10 hours before going to bed

\- cut blue light from your devices at least 1 hour before going to bed

\- get your 6 to 8 hours of sleep - depending on how many hours you need

\- meditate 10 minutes first thing when you open your eyes - sit in bed for 10 mins, breathe, stay in the moment, present with your being, relaxed

\- meditate 10 minutes last thing before going to sleep - sit in bed for 10 mins, breathe, be present with your being, relaxed

\- stop taking anything external to sleep, this does not work in the long term. The real super power and solution is LEARN HOW TO CONTROL YOUR BODY ON YOUR OWN without having to take ANYTHING - sounds much better doesn't it?

You got ALL the solutions right inside of you my friend. Your body is the biggest pharmacy, biggest shaman, biggest whatever thing you think you need.

Thanks for sharing.

I suffered terrible with sleep early in my time with stress and anxiety. 

Game changer for me was building a daily foundation of relaxing nervous system, calming my mind and body. 

For me the big three were working with the breath, mindfulness and meditation. 

This foundation gave me the space in my stress and anxiety to then add more practices to feel even better.

"Caffeine affects different people different ways. If you're sensitive to it, it can give you the jitters.

If it's not abused, caffeine can be good for most people. A common problem with this is drinking coffee in the late afternoon and evening can make getting to sleep hard.

My best advice for stress -   
  
  
The people who suffer most from stress are those who are most afraid of it. Learning to deal with stress is partly learning not to fear it.  
  
  
Fear is the thing to deal with.  
  
  
When you're worrying, you're not really thinking. You're just spinning your wheels.  
  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.

"Is it possible to decrease your caffeine intake or at least cut off at least 8 hours to bedtime? 

Try going to bed earlier. Maybe your natural sleep pattern is switching itself up. 

Melatonin might be helpful at kicking your body into sleep mode, but if you have less than 6 hours less of sleep left to go, it might cause some grogginess. l-theanine and GABA are good supplements for pre-sleep. 

The worst thing to do when you wake up is look at any screens. No phone, no TV, no tablet. Those all can kick your brain into wake-up rhythm. Daydreaming back to sleep (about pleasant things or experiences, not about drama or anxieties) could potentially help. Worst case scenario, go to the bathroom, have some water, and read a book (with a low, soft light) until you're ready to fall back asleep. 

Try to develop some sort of habit. Phone down 1 hour before bed, light music or reading, drinking a cup of tea, meditation, or a guided sleep mediation. 

Ultimately, 3 hours before bed, all the drama should be cut out. Even before sleep, you need some awake time for your body to relax and wind down."	MissNegraModelo	reply	na	na	na	0.0022448941599577665	no	no	strong	na	stress
"OP I'm not sure what to do either.

 I have been having chronic stress for a decade. I can't sleep. I am caught in a vicious cycle and I am at my wits end.

I tried melatonin, l tryptophan , l theanine, Gaba, 5htp. Even cannabis which is legal in my state.

I consume no sugar or caffeine. I workout 5 days a week and walk 40 minutes a day on the treadmill. I don't eat anything I don't cook. I usually eat, chicken brown rice and broccoli. Two times a day and a protein shake and oatmeal for breakfast. No alcohol.

I don't get out and socialize much because I live in a remote rural area. I only see people other than my wife once a month when we go into town for groceries. 


The stress causes anxiety and my anxiety causes frequent urination especially at night I get up every hour. I go to bed at 10pm most nights and toss and turn and get up to urinate and can't shut my mind down. Maybe 1 to 2 hours of combined sleep a night. 

I am guessing my cortisol is through the roof. I am stuck in fight mode of the flight or fight thing.

"These are the Two Most Effectively Scientifically Proven Ways to Reduce Stress and Anxiety: 

**1) Meditation**

**2) Running**  


Understand that:

Stress is your body telling you it's in emergency mode. You might not feel it is because of any particular reason, but your body runs in layers of auto-pilot so you have to break that automatic pattern that is running in your organism. 

All of your options so far are things that you **do.** 

These are not going to stop your mind from working automatically.

You need to break the pattern and that means you have to sit still, in a comfortable position, and be there for long enough until you start feeling better in your own body. You have to practice **Meditation -** it won't be comfortable at first, but guess what? That is where the problem is. When you reach the point where it gets comfortable, I assure you, you won't even remember your stress any longer. \[You'll be able to deal with it much better.\] - Start with 10 mins in the morning, 10 mins at night. Increase that time progressively.

Then, you're going to couple that with the scientifically most effective exercise to cure stress and anxiety: **Running**

No caffeine for now, no motivational vids or internet. That will just keep the machine running.

You need to stop the machine. Reset. Reteach the body to be comfortable with no stimuli.

"I'll tell you something very interesting about writing. I learned this from a NY Times article, ""What's All This About Journaling?"" The author of the Times article says that she has been very happy using the approach to journaling recommended by self-help author Julia Cameron, which is writing three longhand, stream of consciousness pages right after waking up. Stream of consciousness - just writing whatever pops into your head at the moment. The Times author said that this is therapeutic and helps her with solving problems.  
  
I've been doing this in the early morning, and I am **absolutely amazed** at how ideas come to me this way.  
  
This is consistent with what psychologist Kelly McGonigal of Stanford says in her book The Willpower Instinct, which is an excellent guide to self-control. The book is very readable and loaded with good science.  
  
All-nighters should be avoided. You need good sleep for the brain to work right.  
  
Do try to engage in healthy lifestyle things to avoid burnout.  
  
Some of the things that help with stress take no time at all - slow breathing, esp. when you're stressed, fish oil caps with omega-3, bright light exposure at breakfast time.  
  
A good habit - always respond to a stressful moment by breathing slowly.   
  
When you’re calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say that 10 minutes of slow breathing is good. The exercise they recommend is breathing gently through the nose, 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out.

You need to be as effective as you can, correct? The more you optimize yourself the better you will do with your work

\- sleep 6 to 8 hours at night, cut caffeine 10 hours before going to bed

\- wake up, meditate for 10 minutes - get a clear mind and get to your deep work sessions in the morning - if you can fast during these times your might avoid brain fog

\- walking meditation to distress, reset and reenergize - walking with open posture, heart open, focused on deep breathing with your heart 

\- Being tired means = I'm not working as effective as I can be, which means I'm wasting my time - don't waste your time, do the right things

So I've been in paramedic class for about a year now. I've noticed every Wednesday when we have class, I get this intense spike of pain every time I come in. Sometimes it's something that alleviates when I go to the bathroom, but it is always Wednesdays. I thought maybe it's the benadryl I take to help me sleep the night before, but that doesn't make sense. I thought it was because that was the only day of the week I get up early, but if I had to get up early for other things, I don't get pains at all, much less this intense. I'm not quite sure if it's something I should go to a doctor for.	VampyreBassist	post	23.09235469178755	male	White	0.9981471300125122	na	na	na	5	stress
I would guess anxiety about class or a change in schedule, or maybe your eating habits are different on Wednesdays?

"Sounds like your subconsciously stressed about this particular class - You either hate or fear someone in that particular class or your in love with someone in that class;)

"Stress is your body telling you there's a threat out in your environment. Your body believes it is being threatened and it's in emergency mode. Thus it allocates resources to survive and not fight disease, which gets your immune system weak and compromised.

Stress for long periods of time results in pain which can manifest in any part of your body.

Understand that your default mode is HEALTH and that you're not supposed to be feeling this way.

  
You need to reprogram, reteach your body to believe it's safe and everything is ok, and learn to master and channel all these energies.

My husband is 35 male, fit and healthy. Never had any previous medical issues and isn’t on any drugs and a non smoker. 

He works as a PE teacher and I would say had been pretty stressed out over the past month or so. He has had a few head knocks over the years as a child and two concussions from playing rugby for pretty much his whole life. 

Over the past couple of weeks he has started to forget things and he is really worried about it. He couldn’t remember the name of our sons old school (I would say a tricky thing to remember at times) but the worst one was he couldn’t remember the road near our house for about an hour the other day. It’s really really worrying him and we have made a doctors appointment but not for another 2 weeks!

"My current office has a number of things which I believe are toxic and my mental health has taken a toll. It seems to get worse as time goes by which is causing concern.

To provide some context - I am 25 years old and work as a land surveyor at an engineering consultancy in New Zealand. The company I work for is a large firm with around 12 offices and requested a transfer from the one in the big city (Auckland) to the one in my home city around two years ago. I have been struggling to cope with anxiety since high school and Auckland was too stressful a place to live in for me (one of the top 5 most expensive cities to live in the world, crazy traffic and I found the people to be unfriendly). The office itself was great though and I fit in to the team well, but I was living with older, random flatmates. The flat became hostile and I decided I am better suited to living alone with my partner, but everything in Auckland was either too expensive or an hour out of town. Hence the move home.

When I arrived home, things reversed. The city itself is nice (although people still aren’t the friendliest), but the office is way stricter. My colleagues are nice enough but there is a culture of bossiness and tattle tales, particularly when it comes to health and safety. For example, as soon as I started, a girl I was working with decided that the way I was working was unsafe (even though it’s how I did things in Auckland) and reported it to higher management. Around 5 people from multiple offices got in trouble and I was shipped off to a meeting room with three levels of managers where I was made to feel incompetent at my job and made an example of. My survey manager is also nice enough, but he doesn’t listen to anyone’s ideas and talks over us. In Auckland I worked overtime (which I don’t mind doing as long as I’m paid), and all my extra effort got approved. In Tauranga every single overtime hour I have worked has been declined. They are obsessed with cutting costs and send you timesheet reminders two days before they are due. I’m often in the field so don’t get a chance to do this which results in further trouble. 

My manager gives me feedback after every job, and although it’s aimed to be constructive, in two years not one bit has been positive. I’m not the greatest surveyor in the world but I sure as hell am not bad at my job. I get anxiety whenever a review comes up now.

Basically, I don’t feel like I fit in with their office culture which I believe is toxic. This is the tip of the iceberg and there are other things but I won’t share them now. But I find myself waking up in work days with dread and negativity. Now I just be polite but struggle to talk to anyone face to face.

I want to find another job but I’m really bad with my finances. Luckily there are plenty of jobs in my industry but the cost of living here is also high and a lot of middle income earners are doing it tough too. Moving into the regions would be cheaper but that’s months away to scrape together a bond.

I now hate my job but am not fond of the idea or cost of moving. I like the idea of moving to a firm where surveyors are less the outcasts and the scales of projects are smaller and more fulfilling, but I fear that I’d feel like an imposter wherever I’d go. 

Any advice for this sad Kiwi? Am I overreacting? Would the effort of a move be worth escaping the perfect corporate servant my employer wants me to be? Do I leave my job I spent four years and $60k of student loan studying for? Do I look at moving countries with my girlfriend and escaping it all? All I want is for things to get better and to be around a happy, constructive bunch for 40+ hours a week, so any feedback is welcomed by me ☺️

"Mental health taken a toll? Only reason you need to leave that job. You don't need any other reason. Anything that hampers your mental/emotional health is not worth pursuing or spending time on. People who have continued with such jobs, later faced worsening health problems, both physical and mental, then your expenses rise for hospital visits, blood tests,, diagnostic tests, medicines, leave taken off work (if it's unpaid), etc. But worst of all is YOUR OWN suffering and the precious TIME you waste in that sickness, that could have been spent on pleasurable fun productive activities. Simply put, you're basically working a job to earn money to spend it on unwanted (and very much avoidable) high cost of illnesses and recovery. 

If you work at a job that pays low but adds no to minimum stress to your life, THIS will give you a long fulfilling satisfactory life to live, with ample time to spend on things that give you joy and family/ social time. No job is small. No job is worthless. If it contributes to the progress of society and humans, it's a valuable job. If you're providing a service to others, that job is worthy and important.

 About your cost of living in your current City.... If it's that expensive, might as well move away. Shift countries if you can. The experience is worth it. This is not escapism, because wherever you'll go, you'll still get employed and contribute your skills, knowledge, time at some job, and contribute to the progress of society and humans there. Just that you'll save so much more money and live a much better, higher, standard of life. So many people do this. Check out vlogs on YT from such people. They provide guidance for how they went about these journeys.

"Hi friend!

1) Work on yourself, find happiness within (or a glimpse of it) and that will allow you to navigate through your current circumstances and give you the answer on how to change them

2) By finding that clarity within, you will know what you want to do with your life in terms of work and purpose - and nobody can get you that clarity except you - One can only show you the direction (which is what I'm doing) but you will have to walk the path

3) Understand that, you are already looking for answers, that's why you're posting this. That means you do have to find these answers. Get the answer within and your life will shape itself to you.

"Hard to say exactly. You may not be getting the proper training, so it might not be your lack of ability, but their lack of an induction plan. If you get more organised quickly you are then doing the most anyone can. So should not be worried about the work.

To deal with the sleep stuff now, then remember, you won't get everything perfect when they leave. It'll take weeks to adjust to the new role. As long as you tell yourself that you are doing everything you can, and it's just a job at the end of the day, then tell yourself not to worry about it. Another self reflecting thought you can have; is that no matter what happens in the job / No matter what unknowns there are, nobodies life is on the line, nobody will die, there will still be a tomorrow and you'll get to reset tomorrow.

1. Flag it to the manager going on leave that you are finding it difficult. Ask if they have a system to track everything that you could also use. Maybe they can give you some extra notes or techniques.

2. Starting now, if not already, get a notepad and write down everything you need to do on a daily basis. List your activities, projects, steps for each project etc. Getting it all on paper will help as a backup. Do this step each day during work taking notes all day and when work finishes, spend up to an hour reorganising those notes and adding anything you missed.

3. Draw a personal weekly organiser. Ie. Draw a table; Mon- Fri,  splitting each day into between 2 and 6 time blocks. Fill in what you need to do in each block like, admin, outbound calls, written reports etc. Essentially structure your day so that you can best organise this new role to a way you see fit.

"Roadmap:

1 - Your body is in emergency mode - Bring it back to homeostasis (balance and health) = That will make you eligible to think, just for starters

2 - Rehearse the ideal scenario at work, and become familiar with being the most comfortable in there. = That will make you familiar and comfortable with the idea of this new job

3 - Organize/Plan/Write down the activities and tasks you'll execute in the new job and how they could be done well to the best of your abilities

4 - Understand that this is a great step for you and it is working to your evolution. You feeling uncomfortable means this new situation is raising the bar higher, which means you need to grow to this new level. Pretty amazing isn't it? So master this 'uncomfortable scenario' until it becomes 'comfortable'

5 - Don't be scared of this new phase. It's exactly what you needed to get you to the next level. The responsibilities we receive are proportional to our capacity to manage them. You got this.

Go to the doctor and get checked. If you want to monitor your stress, buy a digital blood-pressure meter and use it on the daily basis - morning, noon, evening + any time you feel stressed and write the values down, together with the cause.

"Ok. I think I know what's going on. This may be the most likely cause behind your problems, so you must rule it out to see if this truly is the cause or not. When the body is exposed to Sudden high amounts of stress, especially post a long period of on and off stress,  it can cause inflammation within the body. This is very damaging to your system. That inflammation can cause the burning in your fingers. This MAY happen. It may not either. But what definitely is causing BOTH the burning and tingling is a severe b12 deficiency.  Stress can deplete the body of vital nutrients, including b12. 

I suggest you check for nutrient deficiencies in vitamin D and B12, as these deficiencies can cause many different kinds of mental disorders, like anxiety, panic, depression, negative irrational thoughts, overthinking, etc. normalisation of levels diminishes these problems. It's quite MIRACULOUS how this works. speak with a doctor about getting blood tests done for vitamin D, B12, folic acid. If deficient, supplement under the care of a doctor till your levels normalise. But DO NOT take supplements without checking your blood levels. You only need them, and they'll only resolve these symptoms, IF you're deficient in them.

 Irrespective of nutrient deficiency, these symptoms can go away when the body is no longer exposed to stress. You have to be calm, peaceful, complete opposite of stress, after which you'll find these symptoms going down. Even ceasing.

I really appreciate your reply.  Yes, you are absolutely right.  6 months ago, due to high heart rate and stress and anxiety, I had all the required tests like blood test, MRI, echocardiogram, EEG, EKG, and there was nothing wrong with them.  Of course, the MRI revealed that I should be more careful with my neck, because it is close to arthritis, and I even gave the possibility that these tingling sensations might be due to my neck.  But since I had a panic attack a few months ago and the first place in my body that felt weak was my hands, I felt that this series was also due to the stress and tension that I had these few days and I must add that it was my period, too.

" 

When the Covid pandemic began, I started experiencing progressive pain throughout my body, which could have been related to the virus, stress, or emotions during that time. It started with pain between my shoulder blades, followed by stiffness and cracking sounds in my neck. I also experienced lower back pain, tingling in my left foot, tendinitis in my elbow, and muscle pain when working out. Recently, my two left fingers have been slightly numb and painful.

I had X-rays done, which showed two small protrusions in my lumbar and thoracic spine, but they were not the cause of my pain. I also visited a neurologist and did some tests, including an electromyography, and everything was perfect. I went to a ""special"" clinic for Lyme disease and received a barely positive result. I underwent treatment for eight months with a combination of antibiotics and herbs, but I stopped because I wasn't seeing any progress and was experiencing many side effects.

\+ All my bloodwork came perfect .

It's been over three months since I stopped the treatment, and I'm feeling better way better than i was during treatment

NOW the biggest thing that i somehow found is :

IF i breath trough my stomach / diaphragm (something that i never did )  so much pain goes away its incredible , breathing like this for an entire day made me capable of  bending my back and do stuff with so much less pain, neck stiffness reduced extremely  i have no explanations for this

If i go back to my ""old way"" of breathing ( trough my chest/back ) i literally get so much pain , my entire back area gets inflamed & extremely painful to the point that i even start sweating.

Is this related to : stress & emotions / depression etc  ?

Has anyone dealt with stuff like this ?"	Money_Quail_195	post	20.7476991729645	male	White	0.0022967292461544275	na	na	na	1	stress
This could easily be related to stress - when we have been stressed for a certain amount of time, it effects our bodies in alot of different ways, your nervous system has most likely gone haywire and needs to be “reset”, so to speak. I can recommend a meditation practice called nidra yoga: [link](https://youtu.be/8it-0wyBtVY). I can also recommend practicing mindfulness - be in the present, Eckhart Tolle has a written a very helpful book about the subject: [Power of Now](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Now-Guide-Spiritual-Enlightenment/dp/1577314808)	Money_Quail_195	reply	na	na	na	0.0022967292461544275	no	no	no	na	stress
I really wish anyone can help me or i just wanna know if anyone is experiencing the same things i am because i havent found anyone who has. Im getting headaches/migraines every single day. Its been around 2 months now, this isnt the first time this has happened to me it happened 2 years ago same thing. I had migraines every single day non stop for like a year straight, to the point where i couldnt even eat and developed photophobia and couldtn even turn on my room lights or anything. So it eventually went away after a couple months but im back in here again. Doctors tell me that its stress/anxiety but it just doesnt make sense to me as to why it gets this bad to the point where i cant even get up from my bed or be awake for long hours before feeling pain, no one gets it this bad for this long, 7+ months NON Stop??? So it started around November with panic attacks and anxiety, usually something triggers my anxiety and i can control it, but no not this time it happens even when im happy out of nowhere i just feel bad all the time and super weak, then it progressed to me feeling okay in the morning and bad at night, i always knew id feel bad at night so i would do my daily duties during the day. Then it progressed even more to where i started getting my migraines/headaches every day and the light started triggering them. And now end of march im back in my room again lights off, headaches everyday, cant go out cant do anything, i can barely even be on my phone, lights all the way down and blue light off. I did notice though that it starts in my neck and shoulders and where my arms start on my back. I massage myself everyday, i try to take medications but they all give me extreme side effects even tylenol. I know itll be a few months before i get better, but i wish i knew more people that have gone thru this, i even tried magnesium gummies and got side effects from those as well. Ive been doing so well with my anxiety and i try to feel okay and get distracted but the pain never ever ever goes away just gets worse and calms down, please someone help!		post	18.939319050166358	male	White	0.9988651275634766	na	na	na	3	stress

I have been in a relationship for the past few months and for the first 3 of the months things have been good. This month as been very stressful between work and school and my mental health have just been deteriorating, and because of that I’ve been more easily irritated. I get into arguments now with my gf everyday about the most mundane things. I am mostly at fault since I’m the one starting them, I’ve just felt like nothing has been enough or certain things she doe’s irritates me. I don’t blame her for anything, she has been the best partner ever and has been very supportive. I just can’t get a hold of my temper and I’m scared it’s gonna drive us apart. I don’t want to be angry I just want to love her and not make her be sad.	Geographyismything	post	19.57492564023238	male	White	0.9975776076316833	na	na	na	5	stress

"Hello I'm currently in my third year of university. Since the start I have been very stressed and at times had bad thoughts come into my head. I tried to talk to my parents about switching programs or go to university with less expectations (The University I'm going to is known to be brutal to their students). Sadly that didn't work which I understand from my parents side if I get through it then it will pay off. The next two years for me is just going to be quite scary as I'll be doing a Full Time course load in the Fall, Spring and Summer for two years straight. Just ranting I guess and some sort of motivation would be nice honestly.

School for me has always been a stressful topic and has never changed even in high school I'd say I've always been so anxious or stressed about the topic. Though what I can say is that once I do the two years at least I am out and finish my degree and I can move on from the idea of school. Just ranting at this point as this topic has definitely affected me a lot through out the years but this week it has affected me more than ever but I am now coming into terms that with the two year plan I got going it's not going to be that bad forever."

"hi my friend, you deserve supports! believe me, I know reaching out can bring up thoughts like:  

""it's not that bad!""

why can't it be better? 

""I should be able to do this by myself"" 

you are doing it by yourself already. you can do it. and, you don't HAVE to do it all by yourself. why not make it a bit easier? 

""people will judge me if I get help, or think less of me"" 

those are not your people, and those same people likely need a lot of help they refuse to access. 

I won't pretend that will resolve those thoughts, but I hope it gives you something to consider! 

regarding supports, look into (if you haven't already): 

-getting an anxiety diagnosis (if you have a lot of stress, you likely have anxiety!) 
-using accessibility services at your university once diagnosed 
-taking one less class per semester and taking an extra year to finish (yes this will feel stressful at the outset, but in the long run, it will save you a lot of unneeded anguish ... one year is not a long time in the stretch of your life) 
-accessing counselling (esp if university offers for free, which they should) 
-complaining to understanding friends 

these are just a few ideas, I hope any of them are helpful! you are doing the best you can with what you know, and that is enough. good luck!"	ItsHooopla	reply	na	na	na	0.9953956007957458	weak	no	no	na	stress

"You need to stop, lubricate, and reset your machine. 

Once you get anxiety out of the way, your effectiveness and well being will increase drastically.

Once you get your nervous system under control and biochemistry on your side, you will start seeing things differently.

For lubricating and resetting your organism you need: \[Remember that, these are things that will significantly IMPROVE you overall work and life quality. These are not things that you do, they are natural medications that your body thrives on. Antidepressants will only make you dependent on them without getting to the root of the problem.\]

\- Stillness - Non-Activity - Meditation : Sit in bed, comfortable position, consciously breathing. Until that becomes comfortable and familiar. - That is going to get anxiety out of your own way.

\- Running - Go out and start running. Your body and mind will reboot.

\- Your caffeine should be Awareness. No caffeine for at least 10 hours before going to bed.

\- Sunlight for at least 15 minutes a day

\- Drink a minimum of 2l of water a day

I don’t think they should expect you to be perfect since this is your first job in a field you have no adequate experience in, work on identifying your mistakes then slowly fixing them! Remember along the way and even if you do get fired, that you didn’t intentionally do these mistakes and it’s due to the simple fact of you being new in the job.

"Hello, 

What you are experiencing is called imposter syndrome. You feel like you don't belong and people know it. Most people experience this - and sometimes it doesn't go away! Speak to a few of the older mentors - I bet some will tell you they feel the same way

At the moment you are learning something new - and no one is ever good at a new thing - just doesn't happen - so you will continue to make mistakes - and your own feelings just aren't a good judge of your skills - as you don't know how many mistakes other interns have made - you have no comparisons. 

So just keeping working - if you really suck then your mentor will take you aside and tell you you suck - if they don't then guess what you don't suck - your just new.

Also - sucking at this stage has no impact on your future career - look at any successful person - they suck at everything until they find the one thing they are good at.

"Yeah, I did that for 44 years and jumped right onto a massive  burnout. Physical, mental and emotional.

I got Psychomotor Therapy to learn to recognise the signs of stress.

Every activity you do too much within a certain timespan will stress you, we need time to recover. And not only in the night, also during the day.

For example driving for more then 2 hours without stopping or working/gaming behind a screen hours after hours (mental). Worrying about the past or future (emotional). Or heavy or long physical activity that's more your body can handle (physical).

So check what you have done and how your body responds to the stress. I thought I was lactose intollerant, because I had so many problems. Just stress.. Everybody has their own symptoms. Some people get rashes. Some people get depressed, paranoid... (I'm a hypogondriac when my stress levels are in red). You get light headed and maybe other syptoms that you haven't connected to stress yet.

Back when we lived in caves - when we encounter something scary - like a tiger - a system in our brain - says ' OK, we need to fight or run away!' this is called the fight or flight mechanism. 

When this happens our body shuts down all unnecessary functions - this is what stress fells like:

Our breathing increases - so we can run fast 

Our stomach shuts down - as we don't need to eat 

and importantly for you - our bladder and colon release waste - we poop and pee basically - as again - we don't want to fight a tiger with a full bladder.

In the past this response would last a  few minutes - so we fight the tiger or run away - either way - it's a short lived thing.

"Motivation Hormone - Dopamine

Meditation - 65% increase in Dopamine

You will:

1) Sit in a comfortable position, place your attention in your breath, and stay there. When your mind starts drifting off, you bring your attention back to your breath.

Do this 1st thing when you wake up, and last thing before you go to bed. 15 minutes is good to start.

2) Don't touch your phone in the first 45 minutes of waking up -   
Checking your phone as soon as you wake up can mess with your brain and it is priming you to be distracted - also, seeing something negative or triggering on social can set the tone for the rest of your day - All of that, among other things, drain your energy. That's why you feel unmotivated.

You need Novelty. 

Your body is screaming for novelty.

Here is the key: The world will not change. It will remain the same.

What has to change is the way you SEE that world. And HOW you decide to live in it.

By meditating you will open a new door into your life. That will change the lenses from which you see the world, and the how you live your life. Resulting in a NEW life. New challenges, New perspectives, New actions, New thoughts and emotions, will make you see that it's not about motivation. It's about getting to a certain realization.

"I wonder.. is it my stress, time management, or myself as a person in general that is blocking myself from doing the best I can? Or is it my anxiety and overthinking getting to me?

I am a F14 in my freshman year of high school, currently going through a roller coaster of thoughts and emotions. I'm trying really hard managing between piano, soccer, and my grades with school. I love everything equally, (well maybe except school..), but in the end, my grades are my priority over piano or soccer. I know that piano and soccer may benefit me throughout high school, but grades are more important. But that doesn't mean I'm going to give up on neither one. 

But here I am with a B- (84.5) in my history class, and I need to get it to an A- (90.1) by the end of my school final which is in about 2 months. Well I'll need an A- at least, so I could take AP Euro in my sophomore year, and it's only available in my sophomore year as well. AP Euro is definitely not a necessity for my next year in high school, but it'll benefit me a lot, and as my school is very tough and competitive, I want to achieve my goal and do it. My teacher is crazy strict, being 87 years old, he has his more ""older-fashioned"" and more ""understandable"" ways of grading. So I stress trying to fit into his perfect standards, but at the end of the day, I keep telling myself. In the future, there will always be people that will be wanting a perfect requirement that fits them. I will need to be able to be adjusting to those specific requirements, for the future, to benefit myself and my ideal career future and more.

I've never gotten a B, or a grade range in the B section (B-, B, or B+) throughout middle school and my first semester of high school until now. Is it the stress that's piling on me after all these hard schoolwork I'm not managing well or enough with my time that I have? My sleep schedule is actually horrid, I usually sleep at 2-4AM waking up at 6AM, with soccer practice 3-4 times a week (usually I skip at least 1 day a week since it's a little too much), and 2 lessons of piano a week. Also including the clubs I've decided to join, Mock Trials, which is now coming to an end with competitions. Volunteering, which I guess I could choose which days to help out.. but.. The homework. The load at my school is actually crazy, about 2-3 assignments new each period, which is every day, so in a week total about 30-40 assignments, which is quite a buttload. It's due either the following days, or sometimes, a miracle as it is it'll be due next week. But then again, there's at least 1-2 tests a week, which I need to study a lot for. Oh of course, there's also the projects and essays, let's add about 1 for every other week. 

Should I take a break from piano or soccer, and put my grades at my priority instead? I think I can be able to take my grade, 84.5% up to a 90.1% at least, which is \~6% of a percentage raise that I'll need to be okay. Telling my friends this, all I get in response is the same, ""It'll be okay."" All I wish these days is someone to tell me more than ""it'll be okay"". I'm still new to the environment of high school, and figuring out what fits for me, and what doesn't fit for me. Encouragement, something I haven't heard in awhile, is what I hope boosts me. Thanks for reading this far.

TLDR ; Not having the most decent grade in history class (84.5%), wanting to take AP Euro next year for my class, I need at least a 90.1% for my requirement to join the class. Struggling with the management of piano and soccer as well for my extracurricular activities, as well as school clubs, should I take a break from something? I need to put my grades before other stuff, including the fact to not freak out with studying and use time well. Also wish someone could tell me, I'm able to do it, and they have confidence in me.

"I need to warn you that I'm going to give you the ""youre too young"" spiel in just a few moments. But first I'll try to answer your actual question.

Answer: it depends. You mention school, piano, and soccer. Well depending on your courses and study time (you seem like a ""good student"" so I bet you study), you have
1) First half of waking day allocated to school
2) Second half probably dedicated to soccer
3) Piano sprinkled in wherever
and maybe even friends, downtime, and whatever else you involve yourself with.

Long story short, assuming you have an 8 hour school day 5x a week, you're pretty packed. Like seriously. 
I cant say time management is your issue. You just seem packed. Let go of something. You also might be stressed simply because you have 0 room to breathe. If you don't have room for 7 hours sleep MINIMUM each night and SOME breathing room for break, you're doing things wrong.

But yeah here comes that speech. 
You are very young. I do not relate to you on a ""I was a good student in high school"" level, because in freshman year I was highly suicidal and depressed, and almost flunked every course I took. Long story short, high school was not my priority at the time. 
BUT I can tell you I'm now a 4.0 college student taking extra credits, club president, work in a science lab despite my age, etc. I simply love to learn. Not study.... not achievement (though it's fun when its a side effect of curiosity), not competition.... I love to learn. 
I hope you love to learn. I think too many people who are young get burnt out trying to achieve, achieve, achieve. I was friends with many of those people, some who took school do seriously, couldn't manage it (junior year can be tough on people), and got so stressed they literally got depressed or suicidal. That to me is absolutely insane(ly sad - as in, why the fuck are we all trying to push ourselves so hard at 16, 17?)
You're young. Take risks. Be a little stupid. BREATHE. BREEEEEEEEEATHEEEEEEEEEE. 

Or if you absolutely just want to achieve things, I can't stop you. if that's what you're inclined to do, do it. Get good grades. Do extra curricular on top of it. BUT either way... please just give urself some room to breathe.

I feel you are intelligent. But you are young. You have a life ahead of you- do NOT dwell so hard on short term goals that you aren't able to develop the habits that allow you happiness in the long term."	jnsnk	reply	na	na	na	0.009696527384221554	no	no	no	na	stress
"hello sweet angel, please get more sleep. above all else, that is actually FAR more important. you are barely getting enough sleep to function, and because you're young, your body is going to allow you to do that. but it is very hard on your body to sleep so little. if you have trouble falling asleep, please speak to a doctor, and if they give you garbage advice that doesn't help, try a therapist. 

my brief sleep advice: find whatever relaxes you that isn't on a screen and do that one hour before bed. give yourself a full hour to get into rest mode. enjoy the coziness and comfiness of bed!! you deserve rest! rest is so much more important than grades! you get one body and it needs and deserves rest. I know it's easier said than done, but you will feel soooo much better if you get regular good quality sleep. this may mean putting in a little less effort on tests, assignments, chores, etc. make sure your parents know you are working on getting more sleep, and hopefully they will support you in this as well. 

high school grades are not nothing, and, they are not nearly as important as teachers make them out to be. they are mostly a reflection of, as you very accurately observed, how well you fit the criteria the teacher is looking for. learning to adapt to what people are asking of you is absolutely an important skill, AND, it's very important to recognize what YOU value and how YOU think and feel about things in your (currently very little) spare time.

regarding the grade, I would ask the teacher directly ""how do I bring my grade up?"" most teachers will be willing to tell you what they're looking for. if they're not, unfortunately you're dealing with a little tyrant, and hopefully you can make up for the grade in your other classes. 

you are clearly working SO HARD, so please give yourself a TON of credit! good luck and I hope the teacher helps you get where you want to be, and that you get lots more sleep!"	jnsnk	reply	na	na	na	0.009696527384221554	weak	no	no	na	stress
regarding quitting anything ... if it brings you joy and less stress, keep it. it sounds like soccer might not be filling this criteria. is there a less rigorous/less competitive team? exercise is a great outlet, but if it becomes its own stressor and prevents quality rest, it may be time to consider a different exercise outlet.	jnsnk	reply	na	na	na	0.009696527384221554	no	no	strong	na	stress

It got to the point where I stress about non-school stuff — whether I showered or not, ate or not, read today or not; and sometimes, just stress, about literally nothing.
Maybe I’m writing this for validation, but I don’t think that’s what I need the most. Can someone help me control this damn situation."	DrawingDry4477	post	6.156461720798948	male	White	0.9987534284591675	na	na	na	2	stress
I've been there and it's hard to come out of the mindset that school can put you in. I actually hated going on break because I didn't know what to do with myself or free time. Try something physical like going to the gym, talking a walk/run, or joining a group class. For me that worked and I like the discipline it gave me. Also at the same time everyday I would give myself a writing prompt and just write for an hour. If you need some self care to relax I highly recommend treating yourself to a massage or going to a spa where you can chill in a hot tube or indoor pool. Best of luck!

"Good students are good at budgeting their time. Have a To Do list that includes non-school things. For school, write down due dates of papers, etc. You might want to use one of those weekly planners too.  
  
The non-school things should include what the Army calls R&R - rest and recreation. Plan things for having a good time. Don't neglect healthy lifestyle or you will burn out.  
  
 A good habit - always respond to a stressful moment by breathing slowly.   
  
When you’re calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say that 10 minutes of slow breathing is good. The exercise they recommend is breathing gently through the nose, 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out.   
   
When you’re worried, think calmly about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
The right kind of stress is good for us. With no stress at all, we're bored, and boredom is unhealthy."	DrawingDry4477	reply	na	na	na	0.9987534284591675	no	no	no	na	stress
"Hi all. I've been dealing with neck/shoulder tension for years. I am a software developer with likely bad posture - for over 10 years. Lately I'm quite stressed as well. All in all I'm in a constant state of neck/shoulder tension.

&#x200B;

I've tried so many things but nothing ""releases"" it. I have one of those shoulder massagers from Amazon - it actually feels quite good especially when it rolls up my neck - but I feel like I can do it **forever** and there is just infinite tension there - shouldn't it ""stop"" at some point? I've seen some threads on here but looking to make my own I guess.

&#x200B;

Things I tried:

* PT
* Chiro
* Neck/Shoulder Massager
* Stretches
* Heat pads (these actually help a little but I don't think I should be walking around every day with heat pads..maybe I can?)
* Magnesium Oil
* Like 6 different pillows - none of them result in me waking up without a stiff neck. Down pillows, thin, thick, memory foam, nothing!
* Foam roller
* Theracane/tennis balls

The magnesium drink called recess (you can get it on Amazon) and when I’m particularly tight, I schedule a float in one of those epsom salt tanks. If you look up float spas near you, you can find one. They usually have Groupons. The float helps so much and I sleep so well after. You have to really let your body relax into the water and let your arms float straight out. The front of my chest is sore sometime after because your pec muscles can actually relax and stretch out.

"Hi, 

I used to deal with terrible tension in my neck and face. My posture too was terrible. 

My tension was all down to stress and anxiety, and how they affected my body. 

One of the things that helped was looking at how I was breathing. When we are stressed out breathing mechanics which is basically how we breath is dysfunctional. 

Learning to breath properly, and working to build resilience to stress with a number of other tools. 

Breathwork was so powerful for me I ended up studying about it and now pass on that power.

Instead of the foam roller have you tried the Rumble Roller? It's so painful to roll on and it hits all the trigger points but for me it did wonders. Also, once I started working out and was targeting those areas to strengthen I felt better almost immediately. Red light therapy is another go to of mine.

"I noticed that everytime i am in a daylong stressfull Situation or get the overwhelmed feeling i react with thr same body symptoms. Worst factor is the massive left ear pain (not able to even touch it).
Most times it seems to start (and stay at) pulsatile tinnitus like effects. If i lay my head to the left side or on a pillow, i hear my pulse as swishing dumb sounds making me irritated extremly.
But as other sympathetic system symptoms add up, like fast breathing, fatigue from overwhelmed feeling,appetite loss and obviously higher bp, i get massive pain at left ear.

I tried several treatments to get to know what that could be, antihistamines, nsaids, decreasing glutamate... Thinking it must be a combines inflammation/glutamate/adrenaline thing.

"Is it the same stressful situation or is it general in stressful situation?

As far as you have described it here, this is a clear warning signal from your body that everything is too much for you right now.  
The earache is your body's reaction that you need rest.   
When you have such a severe earache, it's super clear.   
That's why I asked if it's always in the same situation.   
To be able to give more answers, it would be important to know how you evaluate stress in general.  
What strategies you have for coping, long-term and short-term.   
In the long term, you can only cope with stress in 2 ways:  
You avoid the situation completely or you learn to deal with it better."	Pilzwichtel	reply	na	na	na	0.9978600144386292	no	no	strong	na	stress
I feel like it’s related to inflammation. I would try to see if cutting out or minimizing certain foods makes a difference for you (refined sugars, dairy, eggs, gluten). I know it’s a lot of work but cutting out refined sugar for me has made a big difference with my ear pressure. Also gentle lymphatic massages on face and body, or dry brushing especially on neck under ear (do both sides, not just the one that hurts). I hope this helps!

"Unfortunately i already had changed the diet, eating no sugar or crap, but that didnt solve the problem. As i described it comes with overwhelming or chronic stress activation. Inflammation is surely a consequence of activated sympathetic nervous system. Maybe thats why sometimes a nsaid helps acutely.

Lymphatic system seems a good point,as i have chronic sinus problems and dark circles under eyes too and think its a lymphatic problem after trying everything else."	Pilzwichtel	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9978600144386292	no	strong	no	na	stress

"Not breathing exercises so much as the habit of responding to a moment of stress by breathing slowly. I don't know of any stress management method better than this. It's fast, effective, and you can use it anytime.  
  
This calms you down, and when you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
  
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.  
  
My favorite authorities on this are psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg, who have published 6 papers on breathing and mental health. They recommend starting with a breathing exercise and then using that slow breathing rate more and more during the day. 

The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.

"I'm 28. Had 6 dates in my life. Never had sex before. Had 1 bad acquaintance that I needed therapy to deal with.

I don't hate women. I don't think everything is pointless. I chat with coworkers, but I don't have a lot of friends. Ladies seem to think I'm a nice person and funny. I don't have much trouble shamelessly asking someone out. I've long thought I have enough hobbies and interests and goals to keep myself mentally stable and preoccupied. Doesn't stop everyone from saying I'm a sweet guy who just needs to be more confident, less sensitive, and wait for the right person.

I get flustered when I meet someone flirty or shameless, but I play it off with self-deprecation and wit.

I had a date with a coworker who was coming onto me frequently  (poking me, prodding me, talking about bodily functions, giving me looks and signs and thank yous, took my phone number, called me, wishes me morning, acts like she's out of breath around me, talks about and asks me sexual questions, talks about her dating history, etc).

She wanted to go to a Barne's and Noble's. I was 10 minutes late due to traffic and she'd shown up an hour early to give herself a headstart.

She stood next to me, I comically volunteered to be pack mule, and we sat and read books for a while, talking in-between. She made a spa appointment at 4pm. I asked her what she wanted - 1) friendship, 2) casual sex, 3) a relationship. I wasn't good for 2 (no confidence).

She described to me frequently about how much her previous relationships messed her up, we talked indirectly our thoughts about romance and such.

Her answer was 1 and she said she didn't know what the future hold.

We left and I went to a Chic-filet she'd informed me was there. Then I drove home rather than wait the hour for her appointment to finish, said I had fun, and drove home listening to Drowning Pool and Foo Fighters.

I got home, played a video game, laid down, and fought back tears feeling every insecure and negative thought I've had about myself. This date was something I wanted and it felt like I came away with less than I started with. She said she'd text me later and didn't get around to it until much later, and even though it was a short time I felt myself getting lonelier and madder because we just weren't having the initial flirty back and forth we did before the date.

I turned my phone off.

Everyone is going to tell me ""there's a million fish"" and she even said ""some people just don't vibe"" but the messages are just so unclear to me right now. This isn't too long after I broke up with someone who I felt like I did vibe with.

I just can't see myself continuing to give this much energy toward meeting someone new another 5-00 times like everybody else. I'm a sensitive person. I feel drained and hateful of everyone that dating comes so easily to even though I know that's wrong. I'm so mad we didn't click its embarassing, and I know it's not her fault. I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't feel like exercising or doing anything positive. I just want to be angry.

I guess I walked in expecting she'd throw herself at me, and I'd have the chance to be a gentleman and be like ""hey I like you, but I want to get to know you"" and she'd be like ""ah he's not just a desperate fuck, he has character."" And well that didn't happen. Instead I feel like I got read and told politely I wasn't what someone was looking for. And any attempt at friendship on my end will be a desperate act.

I could be entirely wrong. 

I would have liked if we'd hugged at the end or made additional plans. She agreed to doing something in the near future but I didn't get any excitement out of it. Optimistically I want to say we could probably be friends. Cynically I think she's not going to reach out and I spent an hour each way driving, took a day off of work for what I wanted to be a great date - I did all of that for nothing.

Of the 3 actual dates I've gone on after many years of rejection and indifference - the first didn't know how to tell me she wasn't interested and ghosted me for weeks, the second said sweet things about me but said she wasn't ready and was still healing from a previous relationship and said I need to be with someone who can do 50-50 in the relationship, and now this, where I felt someone coming onto me and tried to match it, and realizing at the end that I walked away in a toxic cloud of mental fog.

I hate dating. So much. And I hate the way my brain and my emotions work. So much."	ParmaProscuitto	post	22.18348706776049	female	White	0.9723027348518372	na	na	na	2	stress

my feelings overall and what i’m experiencing, 
-not in my body 
-high but i didn’t smoke (outside of my body) 
-stress throughout the day and night 
-restless and pressure against my chest 
-no appetite (i’ve been eating a small meal once a day now.. it’s barely anything) 
-insomnia (which 2 weeks ago, everything was normal) 
-paranoia 
-a bunch of thoughts on my mind (usually negative) 
-no meaning in life and sadness. like an empty or sort of numb feeling 
-realization that’s talking or texting feels a lot different, it wasn’t the same normal feeling from before, it felt
like i changed in way that isn’t permanent.. i hope) 
-nightmare (which kind of made me realize that there’s something i’m going through that isn’t normal at all, i’ve been through some shit but i’ve never had an actualt nightmare with a plot and this intense before, it lasted about an hour until i woke up) 
-my period is late, and for the past 4 months of tracking it, it hasn’t been late before.

"I have a tattoo that says ‘let your past make you better, not bitter’ although it may not contain to your situation, I do believe if your stress and feelings are overwhelming to that point that working day by day, minute by minute just observing your triumphs and not thinking about how hard it is will help. Be in the moment. Look at that sweet baby and realize it will go by so fast and the memories you have won’t be of their ‘first’ milestones but of your anxiety. 

I know it’s hard to get through it but I’ve lived it many times over and I have come to understand that carrying it with me wasn’t an option.

"Hi there! I will quickly leave my personal story on here, hope it helps:

Grew up in an abusive household, depressive/bipolar mother, parents divorced. As a teen had all those demons bursting back at me. Did not know what happiness or gratitude was whatsoever. Have always had a hard time belonging to groups \[abandonment blockages\] Have lived in 4 different countries and have dealt with the worst conditions and situations. Stress, anxiety, addiction, abuse.

I have found true happiness, and I can tell you exactly what you have to do, because I've done it myself. I've mastered myself completely.

There is a roadmap to it. Things you have to adopt. Energies you have to let go of completely, which will then turn into a different person.

You will not get better being THE SAME PERSON. When you get better, it will be another version of you. A healthy, happy, wise one.

We can get into the specifics of it, but it's just a lot to mention in one post.

Today, believe it or not, I am a coach and teach people to do the same I did, and truly dig up happiness from within. \[I'm not selling you anything. Far from that\]

But just wanted to tell you health and happiness are inside of you. That's why you feel like you deserve it and want it. Because it's where you belong. It's yours by nature.

If you ever need detailed advice, it will be a pleasure speaking to you in the DMs or whatnot. In the meantime, I wish you the best."	Future-Flatworm-9647	reply	na	na	na	0.9922641515731812	weak	strong	no	na	stress

"I've been planning my wedding that is happening in May of this year.

I got engaged a few months ago in January, and at first I felt fine with taking on everything but now it's starting to get into my head and I feel overwhelmed everyday.

My days consist of me working, wedding planning, and sleeping. Most of the time if i'm doing something other than that, I'm thinking of my wedding anyways. If I go shopping there's always something that will catch my eye and remind me of what I need to do or purchase for the big day.

Not only that, but my partner is in another country (LDR) and he can only do so much to help me with it all besides pay for things here and there. I live on my own while my partner lives at home (he's never been on his own before) and i'm struggling to pay for small things like a DJ or even cake.

I've tried talking to him about wedding stuff and he tends to get overwhelmed or be distracted with other things he's doing like gaming etc. Last night, I was talking to him about décor options we had and I showed him our ceremony space. It's on a terrace/large outdoor patio at this nice hotel in my city. I went personally to view the venue a week after we got engaged, sent him videos and photos, and he loved it too! Now when i showed him the photos last night he made a few ""not so happy"" faces and I almost started crying right there from the stress of it all. He kept saying ""I guess it'll have to do.."" and things like that. Felt like I screwed it up so bad.

I feel like a failure, that I picked a bad venue...and to top it all off I have a few people in my bridal party who are being really catty towards me now. They keep shitting on me for having ""bad communication"" even though I'm trying my best and have everything on MY shoulders. They haven't offered to do anything specific but constantly say ""I want to help in any way I can! Let me know what to do!"" and I have no clue what to ask them. Also, a bridesmaid of mine really dislikes my MOH and tries to make me feel like she's not doing ""enough"" and says she feels she's unsupportive.

I didn't even want a big wedding at a hotel. I originally imagined a wedding where I am married at a nice park, have dinner at a nice restaurant and then go to a pub for a beer after to celebrate.

The only reason it became a big wedding is because of my in laws and my family coming, plus a bunch of my friends wanted to go. My fiancé is only bringing 3 family members and none of HIS friends are going to come (despite travelling to Mexico for a wedding recently).

After all this, I can see why people elope or have really really small weddings."		post	25.07134116730099	female	White	0.999207079410553	na	na	na	0	stress

I've recently started a new job position at my current company and have a serious case of imposter syndrome. This position comes with a host of new responsibilities, and I feel as though I'm not performing as well as I should be and I keep making mistakes, I am still in training however I can't help but feel like I'm underperforming and it is mainly to do with stress, I'm stressed out and overwhelmed so I make mistakes and then stress about those same mistakes and it has become this vicious circle. I also haven't been sleeping. It is the only thing I can think about and it's destroying my confidence. I've been having multiple panic attacks sometimes multiple times a day during my breaks and when I am alone at home and have very recently started therapy to try and deal with this however I feel like it's just eating me alive. Has anybody experienced anything similar and perhaps give me a bit of perspective? Or advice on how you have dealt with this kind of stress? Sorry if this is the wrong kind of post for this sub.

"Do you have an experienced peer in the job as an ally that you can confide in? If your boss is this person then great, go for a coffee have a 1 to 1 and be honest. Alternatively, talk to your buddy in the office and ask them (or the boss) what areas you need to work on.

I’m assuming you’re in the US, might be more cut throat over there. Over here honesty about new job jitters is looked on with a bit more compassion and not condemnation. 

If the above doesn’t work, fake it until you make it. I moved to a whole new job 4 years ago and the first 3 years were hell, constant stress and panic, but I feel like “I’m in the zone now” I know the job and some of the pitfalls and my boss has cut me some slack.

Every new job is like an apprenticeship- you won’t know everything right away. Do you think a new firefighter knows how to cut someone out of a car in an accident? Or the first officer landing his first plane? It’s all learning - everyday. 

You are outside your comfort zone and trust me that is the best place to be, dude the stuff you will learn and the amount you will grow will amaze you in a couple of years.

Thank you for your thoughtful comment, I do have some friends at work who are working the same position however it is a different area so it's all a little different for them but they don't see me working so they don't really have any frame of reference to judge how well I'm doing as for my bosses they are not very approachable with this sort of stuff and I think half of the problem is communication you don't really get a lot of feedback unless you make a mistake but I guess it wouldn't hurt to ask where I stand. I'm also in the UK not the US. I guess you're right though I should cut myself some slack, I know it takes time to learn new things and it is a lot of information to take in so mistakes are inevitable and even though I'm out of my comfort zone I will keep trying. I feel like pushing myself is good for me it's just a struggle at the moment again I thank you for taking the time to help put my mind at ease my friend!

I find box breathing (breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 second, repeat) and 4-7-8 (breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds, repeat) are the two techniques that work best for me.

"   
  
  
  
   
  
I read a book by two psychiatrists, Richard Brown and Patricia Gerbarg, who have published 6 papers on breathing and mental health. They recommend changing one's breathing pattern during the day. They say that most adults breathe at a rate that's not very healthy, that we are born with a healthy breathing rate but lose it as we mature, most likely because of stress.  
  
The breathing rate that's best, mentally and physically, is about 5 breaths a minute.   
  
Brown and Gerbarg recommend starting with a breathing exercise. Ten minutes of this is good and 20 twice a day is a treatment for anxiety. Then, the idea is to use that often during the day.  
  
A good way to improve breathing rate is the habit of responding to a moment of stress by using the slow rate.  
  
The exerice is breathing gently through the nose, 6 sec in and 6 sec out.  
  
In a moment of crisis, you can use DBT paced breathing.  
  
 Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK."	mcwhija	reply	na	na	na	0.0015165485674515367	no	strong	no	na	stress

One of the harder things about this too, is that we perceive the opposite of this (not productive, lazy, messy, etc.) as a red flag.

We should be in the gray area of this scale, productive but know when we need to relax. I’ve asked myself why I don’t relax more. Maybe it’s because I feel like I don’t deserve it, that I’m lazy if I do. I still feel so guilty for taking a day off or a break.

As a hypocrite, I would really look at Imposter Syndrome....  
It's totally okay to set higher standards if you want to grow.   
I don't know your situation exactly. But this always helps clients from my trainings. Maybe it has added value for you too:  
Make a conscious end of work, make a little ritual for it  
Also write down everything you still have in your head and what comes to your mind about work.  
You can also do this if, for example, your head is full of thoughts about work at the weekend. Tell yourself then that you have everything in the overview but now is not the time to deal with it.

"Sorry to hear that but you've said it yourself that it's toxic and you guys don't seem to work with each other. I feel like you already know you should break it off and that's why you posted this. You'll feel better once you're free from this stress and then you can either take time to focus on yourself or try to find someone who treats you right and one of the bright sides of leaving a toxic relationship is that now you know what you don't want in a relationship and can try to avoid that going forward.

"I'm a (22 female) and my job is reporting and introducing new stores and foods on TV. It's creative and fun but because of the unstable income my mother doesn't support me.

I knew that from the beginning but hoping to please and attempt to make her proud of my accomplishments she would just say ""Why do I need to say I'm proud of you? You have to be proud of yourself""  It's been an ongoing toxic loop so I always distance myself or not contact her, however since last week she's been living with me and we have been bickering here and there. I don't let that get in the way with work though.


Anyway. Today this random stranger during my break time came up to me and looked directly into my eyes and said

 ""You don't need to push yourself. It's okay.""

She kept holding my shoulders and gently rubbing them and I have no clue if this is hypnosis

 ""I know you have some family troubles right now but I can see there are good people behind you. Really good people""

And little by little the weight in my shoulders started to get lighter. And it felt fuzzy. I had this feeling why does she know my family? Can she read me? Am I readable? Is my aura out? I'm about to panic! Then I just burst into tears and had to control myself to do the next reporting.

It was such a confusing experience because she was smiley nice in her 50s lady. 

Can someone tell me if she was a hypnotist or if she can see my soul or some angels or if she was just an empath that knew I was extremely stressed and wanted to let me know I was stressed. Because later She was motioning to her friend her shoulders like letting her know my shoulders were super tight or scrunched up.

I don't know... It was such a coincidence. And a strange encounter that I had to write about this experience as my first post."	Early-Wrangler-4376	post	22.69535772307015	female	White	0.005702037364244461	na	na	na	2	stress
"I had something similar happen to me once where a man came up to me when I was on the verge of a panic attack and comforted me, telling me he could see I was a sensitive person but assuring me one day I’d look back on things and everything would make sense.   It was spookily what I needed to hear.

I still don’t know if that was a crazy person who does things like that to everyone, someone who made an educated guess about what I needed or if there is some greater kinds of benevolent intuitiveness out there.  I don’t think I’ll ever now but choose to think about the experience positively.  Even if the person was mentally unwell, they expressed it in a moment that provided me with a bit of peace, and for that I am grateful."

"I'm not saying that extrasensory perception is impossible, but what happened can be explained.   
  
It wouldn't be surprising if this person is in the habit of going up to strangers and doing this. She could be lonely and it need of human contact.  
  
When people are unhappy, very often it's because of trouble in the family.  
  
She might think she's psychic because once somebody said, ""How did you know?""  
  
If you want advice for stress, my favorite is this -  
  
A good habit - always respond to a stressful moment by breathing slowly.   
  
When you’re calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say that 10 minutes of slow breathing is good. The exercise they recommend is breathing gently through the nose, 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out.   
   
When you’re worried, think calmly about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.

I'm not an expert in this but I can def say I experience mental fatigue, void and restlessness. Opening up creative channels can really calm you down. So does developing a routine.

"Hi,

I’m a sales director who recently received a promotion to build and lead a new sales operation for an Australian media company in a foreign country. After relocating my family and settling into our new home, I found the job to be manageable, albeit stressful, for the first 8-9 months.

However, after a year, I've realized that the stress has become a part of my daily routine, and it's starting to change my personality. I'm experiencing burnout, feeling completely drained, unmotivated, and even depressed at times. I report to upper management located overseas who may not fully understand the realities of building a new operation in a foreign country. Despite being expected to do more with less, the results are still expected.

I'm struggling to decide if I should push through this or throw in the towel. On one hand, the benefits of international experience, such as building and managing a team in a new market and exploring new commercial initiatives, are invaluable. On the other hand, the stress is taking its toll, and I'm not sure if it's worth it.

I would appreciate any advice from those who have been in similar situations or know someone who has. It can be quite isolating, and I lack a trusted network of experienced expats to turn to for guidance. Thank you in advance for your help."

Finding to people to connect with that you can rely on in the country you are living right now is critical for your health and stress level.

My best advice for stress -   
  
When you're worrying, you're not really thinking. You're just spinning your wheels.  
  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
  
  
One of the best things for stress is to develop good breathing habits. It's very simple, although you might find it a bit hard to develop good habits.   
  
  
A really simple but effective thing - the habit of responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath.   
  
The evidence showing that slow breathing is a fast and effective method of calming down is enormous. It's used in treating anxiety, depression, and PTSD (video - the Stanford PTSD study). Soldiers say that they are able to calm down immediately in dangerous situations by simply slowing down their breathing.  
  
Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg recommend this simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, inhale and exhale 6 seconds each.  
  
Rushing around when you don't have to and doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness.   
  
  
Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind. You can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners' videos on YouTube.  
  
  
Other things take some effort but they're very rewarding - things that make your life meaningful, like a good hobby, art, or volunteer work. Take care of your mental and physical health with the right lifestyle choices.

99% of the time our worst fears don't come true but our brain has a negativity bias as it wants to protect us from danger

Your danger is not meeting other ppls expectations but so what? You're learning and doing your best AND it's harder to do our best and learn when we overload ourselves because we think it will make others happy

But the consequence is it takes a longer time to learn something and expand our own capacity

What if your confidence grew when you slowed down and was honest with mgmt around what you can do right now? So you can fine tune your skills and end up expanding your capacity in the process.

"Recently it does happen that I randomly, all of a sudden, get stress attacks. Like even if nothing happens at all. One time it lasted a whole day and then also the morning after. Recently it started in the night and caused me to not be able to sleep. This stress is usually just feelings of unbearable tension and fear. There are no physical symptoms. During the attacks I get thoughts about all possible things that I ever found stressful. Maybe worth noting that I recently recovered from depression, and it's like the sadness turned into these attacks.

"Journal. It helps when you can actually organize your thoughts and see them in front of you. When I journal, I try and rationalize what I’m feeling. I sit in the stress and try and break it down into it’s simplest form. Think about it. The root of all stress comes from believing the task is extremely difficult. If you’re able to reduce the task, whether that be looking at your own emotions on why you are reacting a certain way or by simplifying the actual task down to what it actually is, it will greatly help the rumination and false narratives your mind is jumping to because it has so much random shit within it!

You can literally just start be writing “the shit that’s stressing me out is x, y, z. I feel x, y, z, about this or that. How can I make my life a little easier? Why am I freaking out so hard?

"If by ""legitimate"" you mean not getting high, you are definitely on the right track. There are MUCH better ways.

My best advice for stress -   
  
When you're worrying, you're not really thinking. You're just spinning your wheels.  
  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
  
  
One of the best things for stress is to develop good breathing habits. It's very simple, although you might find it a bit hard to develop good habits.   
  
  
A really simple but effective thing - the habit of responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath.   
  
The evidence showing that slow breathing is a fast and effective method of calming down is enormous. It's used in treating anxiety, depression, and PTSD (video - the Stanford PTSD study). Soldiers say that they are able to calm down immediately in dangerous situations by simply slowing down their breathing.  
  
Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg recommend this simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, inhale and exhale 6 seconds each.  
  
Rushing around when you don't have to and doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness.   
  
  
Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind. You can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners' videos on YouTube.  
  
  
Other things take some effort but they're very rewarding - things that make your life meaningful, like a good hobby, art, or volunteer work. Take care of your mental and physical health with the right lifestyle choices.

This.  Because the question asks about “legitimate” ways I assume there is comparison to other kinds of stress relief (alcohol, drugs, sex).

"Hi Reddit, I'm here to vent about my stress, and honestly, I have no one to talk to. I am F (23), and last year I started my first ""big girl job"" as a copywriter in marketing. I originally studied filmmaking to be a screenwriter or producer, anything to get me to be on set. My love and passion for being behind the scenes and seeing the projects come to life are breathtaking. I enjoy talking to the cast, getting behind the camera, and being transported to a different unique world. So why was my first big job in marketing? 

During the pandemic, my concern was how to get myself out there when I was very limited in making connections and unable to go out and shoot because of social distancing measures due to the pandemic. The school I was in offered an internship for a class in marketing, and I took it (honestly, anything to make my portfolio and resume look good). Not going to lie; the internship was fun and exciting, so when they offered me an entry-level position in marketing, I was hesitant. I didn't study marketing or advertising or anything related to that, just filmmaking. They knew that I only had knowledge of film but still wanted to give me a chance to explore my career options. Now, having been here for a year, I've built up an extreme amount of stress.

Every single day I am constantly feeling stressed, anxious, and depressed. I'm always messing up, and it has gotten to the point where I received a PIP. I saw it coming. 

I am struggling with my grammar, not being strong enough when it comes to presenting, and lacking creativity. Things are so rushed here that I often miss a thing or two, which reflects poorly on me. Being dyslexic doesn't help either. As a result, I received a PIP, and it has spiked my stress levels and anxiety to the point where I feel sick every day. I can't eat, don't feel like getting out of bed, can't breathe, can't sleep, and can't think clearly.

Additionally, I have been struggling with a yeast infection for six months (yes, you read that right). My doctor says I have a candida overgrowth, so I am on a strict diet in hopes of getting it under control.

The whole experience is making me feel like a failure, like I've made a big joke out of myself. My manager talked to me and said that copywriting marketing isn't for me because I didn't learn it, and he knows my skills lie elsewhere. I agree, but I am afraid I won't find a job in film with how the economy is and the difficult hiring process I see on social media. It's terrifying. How am I going to pay for school, debt, help my parents, pay for groceries for this stupid candida diet, and help my grandma in Mexico, and more bills?

My parents and a coworker of mine are giving me words of encouragement and saying that everything is going to be okay. They say I should still be proud because I tried something new, created a new set of skills, and toughened up. I don't know if that's true."

"Sorry if this isn't appropriate for here, but the stress is killing me. I'm 24 and I feel like I've got the stress of a 45 year old going through a midlife crisis! 

Three weeks ago, I started up a new job with security, I got one 6 hour shift, and three 12 hour shifts. Honestly, I love this job despite the hours, and I can handle it. 

But, this past week? Everything feels like it fell apart. My sister popped over with her husband on a surprise visit ( haven't seen her in 14 years ) so it should've been exciting, but all it did was bring trouble to our already fragile household. She instigated drama with my father and everyone else, then her boyfriend was just causing problems with zero consequences. Then, two days later, my Uncle shows up and it's all great.. up until he hits me with news tonight that he's got cancer and he's trying to enjoy himself since he's scared of worse case scenario. All of this on top of family dilemmas with my father, seeing it affect my grandmother? ALL tied together with the very awkward sleep I get, I can just feel my mental health regressing back to incredibly old, toxic, unhealthy ways. I wanna smoke weed to ignore the stress and call off work, but I know doing all that will ruin any progress I've ever made. 

Oh, I'm also having allergies worse than ever so my nose is constantly dried up, in pain, slightly bleeding and my eyes itch like hell. I know I'm just yapping at this point, but good lord, it feels like way too much to stomach in such a short amount of time.

"I’m 24 as well and my father was diagnosed with cancer during Covid. I also suffer from an anxiety disorder and negative thoughts so I know damn well these feelings your having and while I can’t solve them all for you, I can at least give you some advice.  Clearly, youve had a lot of unfortunate shit happen at the same time, most of it out of your control. The trick is to try and organize your thoughts so you can break down the issues your currently having into their simplest form. The best way to that? Write everything your going through in a journal, bullet point by bullet point. Once you write everything down, I want you to take some time to analyze how you feel about all of these things. If you begin to get those same negative feelings that spike your brain, continue writing and feel that shit. The goal is to release everything your feeling onto the paper. It’s easier to pinpoint and deal with feelings when you can see them in front of you. I can’t guarantee it will take everything away, but i can guarantee it will reduce the severity of how your looking at every situation in your brain. Next, list what you are grateful for. You can even list positives about your negatives too.

Also, don’t go to weed if you can. I’ve been there and while it helps for the night, it ain’t going to help for the long run. Weed puts you into a state that’s too good to be true. And there are many downsides that can lead to a worsening of anxiety and depression.

That really is a lot to handle in such a short amount of time. I feel for you my friend. I hope this doesn't come off as an empty sentiment, but just do the best you can and be patient with yourself. You are going through a lot and can only handle as much as you can handle. Work may seem daunting before you go, but I bet if you make it a habit of just showing up one day at a time, it will keep your mind occupied and help you feel a sense of fulfillment. I'm not sure if there are better ways to cope than smoking weed for you, but try to find a good outlet to give yourself a break and unwind without falling back into old habits. You got this!

"Good that you're staying away from weed - this can be a really bad habit.

I'll give you a brief answer with my favorite stress advice. If you want more, I'll be happy to share.

A good habit - always respond to a stressful moment by breathing slowly.   
  
When you’re calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say that 10 minutes of slow breathing is good. The exercise they recommend is breathing gently through the nose, 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out.

"One of the best ways to decrease how much total stress you experience is by adding good forms of stress (short and moderate) called hormetic stressors.  Cold water is a prototypical hormetic stressor.  It releases stress hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline but it is short and not extreme.   

We just launched an app that provides guided cold showers to make it easy for you to do them.  It is led by a Master Chief Navy SEAL.  We teach you a set of mental tools around tactical breathwort, body relaxation, self talk, etc.  These tools not only make cold showers easier but they also help you handle stress more generally.    

In fact, the best way to train yourself to handle stress better is to systematically stress yourself and then practice these tools while stressed.  If you do that, these tools will become reflexive any time your body generates stress hormones.

You’re 17, you have so much to learn an experience. But you’ll realize as you go through life that every “big issue” you’re having one moment seems so insignificant much sooner than you think it will. No matter what the issue is you will always find a solution and then there will be something else to try and solve. Try to not look at these things as problems but rather as puzzles, all the pieces are there to solve it, but now that you’re growing up it’s going to be up to you to put all the pieces together. And trust me, you will figure it out.	wierd_neighbor	reply	na	na	na	0.9989650249481201	weak	no	no	na	stress
"Maybe I can offer some consolation. As people mature, the problems get more complicated but along with that you have better problem-solving and coping skills.

I'll give you a little stress advice. I'll give you a more detailed comment if you like, with advice from experts.

A good habit - always respond to a stressful moment by breathing slowly.

When you’re calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say that 10 minutes of slow breathing is good. The exercise they recommend is breathing gently through the nose, 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out.

When you’re worried, think calmly about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.

The right kind of stress is good for us. With no stress at all, we're bored, and boredom is unhealthy. Best-selling author Kelly McGonigal of Stanford University has a good book - The Upside of Stress."	wierd_neighbor	reply	na	na	na	0.9989650249481201	weak	no	no	na	stress

Meditation is literally one of the best things you can do but OK. Exercise, spend time in nature, eat well, sleep well and just take care of yourself. Make time for things you enjoy. It’s also helpful to vent to someone that you trust, rather than holding things in. I also journal at night, using an app. I write out the positive things that happened during my day so my brain stops focusing on so much negative.	imbaatmaan	reply	na	na	na	0.995940089225769	no	no	no	na	stress
"Learn about yourself and how you got burnt out.

People don't get burnt out just in a week or year. It takes years of ignoring your physical, mental or emotional boundaries.

Were just a piece of hardware that we need to maintain correctly. We need healthy food, drink water, enough sleep and rest, and to exercise our body and mind.

As long as you don't understand how you got yourself burnt out, you will keep on repeating he mistakes that got you into a burnout.

The biggest cause of stress is having the wrong thoughts.

The thoughts create wrong boundaries or makes you have no boundaries. A simple example is not being able to say ""No"" to a task, because <insert some thought or expectation>, even if whatever you need to do stresses you into a burnout. (A belief like ""I need to do whatever the boss says"")

When you prioritize other people or addictions above your own wellbeing for years you'll break.

Certain thoughts create disappointment, anger, fear or sadness which stresses. We are responsible for our own thoughts so we can discard thoughts that cause unneeded disappointment, anger, fear or sadness. We get more emotions if we have an expectation that is totally different from reality.

So it starts with a thought, you'll feel the emotion and act upon that emotion and the result is stress.

Wise people think before doing stuff. Every act should add to your own wellbeing and should not decrease the wellbeing of another. You may share your energy, but it has to be balanced, you should always have enough energy to maintain yourself.

Your body signals you about your wellbeing. You feel happy, tired, irritated, stressed, sad and lonely, worthless, depressed or maybe even suicidal. It's a scale, the worse your wellbeing the worse you feel.

Somewhere before you were burnt out, you already got signals from your body. You were ignoring its needs and especially the need for rest and recovery.

So start to understand how you made it able to get stressed.

Very important is to get more control over your thoughts. Be aware of your thoughts and why you have them. Observe them. You are not your thoughts, as you van observe them.

You can transform the way you think so it causes you less stress.

You need to exercise your mind to be more in control over your thoughts. So just observe your thoughts and let them pass without judgement. That's all you have to do. The goal is to not to react to whatever we think, so we get more time to wisely think about the way to react to a thought."	imbaatmaan	reply	na	na	na	0.995940089225769	weak	no	no	na	stress

"I was wondering if someone recognizes the feelings I have sometimes because I feel like I am weird and alone. I've read about anxiety and think that's what I have... But there's so much info online that I do not know for sure.

I get minor panic attacks on random moments and I can not seem to find any reason why.  
The most recent example is when I was asked to go on a team meeting outside of working hours. I felt almost frightened and felt like I wanted to cry and life is too overwhelming for me. Another example is a party I recently went to, I was scared to go for about two weeks (even though my gf and a friend were with me). There was literally nothing bad about it, but I was stressed up until the moment I got there.

When I try to think of a reason why I'm feeling like that, I do not have a single clue. My life is good and I have everything I need/want but I keep looking for small things that make me feel unhappy and anxious. I can stay awake and panic/overthink over all kinds of small things like this. I just want to feel happy and stop overthinking constantly but I do not know how to do that. Sometimes I think it will get better when I'll get older (25y right now). But the negative feelings are taking over more frequently and  I am ready to start working on it  so I can actually enjoy life. Any advice?"	mfgs9	post	17.2772509867845	male	White	0.9959624409675598	na	na	na	5	stress
"My advice might not be accurate, but I can relate to this problem on a personal basis since I experience this rather frequently as well. 
I’m not certain, but I would assume this is anxiety. Getting a proper diagnosis for anxiety will be undoubtedly more accurate than my opinion, so I recommend it. 

The only advice I can really offer you is to try and be even more self-aware. I’m not saying you aren’t already self-aware and it certainly isn’t your fault you feel this way, so please don’t blame yourself. Being self-aware has personally helped me realize a lot of my mistakes, symptoms, and triggers. I’ve made plenty of improvements thanks to being self-aware, so I can guarantee it’ll help at least a little. 

Being positive and forgiving to yourself will also help. If you’re someone that’s often nice to others, but not very much so to yourself, try treating yourself how you would treat others. You aren’t any less important than everyone else. Nobody is useless even if your thoughts tell you so. Rationally, everyone can be useful and helpful in some way. If you carry something for someone else, talk to them about something nice, or tell someone about the weather are all small things that can prove helpful to them. Carrying something for that person might surprise them and put them in a slightly better mood and it might so help them avoid back pain. Talking to someone about a random but nice topic might help them relieve some stress they’ve been having and put them in a better mood, improving their day. Telling someone about the weather could help them avoid getting soaked or scolded for being “irresponsible.” These “little” things can help other people a lot. Something so small such as a few words can even stop someone from su1c1d3, so really, anyone can be helpful to someone on this planet as long as they’re willing to put some effort. They may not always notice or agree, but they are undoubtedly still helpful in some ways even if they don’t think so themselves. After all, some people with negative thoughts and low self-esteem tend to feel nothing they do is enough and would never be of any help to anyone, which isn’t true. 

I apologize for blabbering on about that, it just seemed necessary to describe the term properly since it’s very important. 
In case nobody has told you so already, it’s okay to feel this way. It isn’t bad nor is it your fault. It isn’t good for your health though. Even so, it’s completely fine to feel anxious and unhappy. It doesn’t make you weird in any way. We have negative emotions for a reason after all. Plenty of other people are upset and anxious, it doesn‘r mean anything’s wrong with them or you. You’re having a difficult time right now and deserve help and advice. That’s all, nothing bad or shameful in the slightest. 

Okay, back to my main point. Talking to yourself positively and forgiving yourself for small mistakes can help a bit in the process. It’s also a good idea not to be too harsh on yourself or hate/blame yourself for feeling the way you do. Getting professional help is advised, but talking to a friend, guardian, or someone you trust is also a good idea. However, before you do, it’s a good idea to think about their personality. 

Are they realistic and rational, toxic and fake, naive and positive? 

Realistically speaking, talking to someone realistic and rational with some empathy and/or kindness would be best. 

Talking to someone toxic and fake is a VERY bad idea especially if you aren’t used to being criticized or if that kind of thing bothers you a lot. 

There’s nothing wrong with talking to someone who’s a little simple minded and positive, but it isn’t really recommended since they may not be able to convince you with their opinions especially if you have trust issues. They may be a little simple minded and believe that they’re just kind of the way they are and not dig into it very much. If you’re also simple minded then it’s fine, but otherwise, you might question whether they’re really right about their opinion when there’s not much facts. 

If you pay attention to even the small things you do and get enough alone time to question yourself about anything that’s considered negative or unhealthy, it might help you slowly get a better idea as to why you’re feeling this way. It may be related to some trauma you had as a child or something negative you’ve been told for awhile now. Talking to others about it might also help, but what personally helps me most is talking to myself. I find myself discovering new facts about myself and my health that I was completely oblivious to until not long ago. 

For example, if you’re someone who’s often stressed, there’s undoubtedly a reason for it. Oftentimes, people know the reason if they’re often stressed because of it. However, because they’re already frequently stressed, they don’t always notice when their stress has increased or if there’s additional stress because of a new issue. This happens even more so to people who have been under stress for long periods of time.  

That’s really all the advice I have to give. Hopefully none of it was offensive. I apologize if anything offended you or anyone that read my comment. If there’s anything I should elaborate my perspective on, I can when I have time. However, arguments or pointless disagreements that aren’t for either party’s learning isn’t something I’ll participate in and that really goes for everyone that reads this."	mfgs9	reply	na	na	na	0.9959624409675598	weak	strong	no	na	stress
"First of all I really want to thank you for taking the time to reply.

Your comment really made me think about my life and I can relate to everything you say. The only thing I am really struggling with it being positive and forgiving to myself. I am that kind of person that sees the worst case scenarios in every situation, I make up things in my head before they even happen and I have issues believing that people are kind and trustworthy.

When I am at home I have a lot of these conversations with my girlfriend. That's someone I trust 100% and everytime I need to talk I try to explain to her what I need. She is an amazing listener and tries her best to give me advice and be there for me. She did tell me that she can not help me to the fullest because she is not experiencing the same. That's why I wanted to talk to my therapist (I've been to therapy a few times in my life). But my therapist is no longer available, which makes it really hard to go out and find someone new. Guess that has something to do with trust. The main thing I got from those previous sessions are kind of the same what you are telling me. Creating a positive mindset.

When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
  
  
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
  
  
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
  
When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.

Everybody's talking about slow breathing for stress. One of the reasons why people smoke - it changes your breathing pattern.'  
  
 My best advice for stress -   
  
When you're worrying, you're not really thinking. You're just spinning your wheels.  
  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
  
  
One of the best things for stress is to develop good breathing habits. It's very simple, although you might find it a bit hard to develop good habits.   
  
  
A really simple but effective thing - the habit of responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath.   
  
The evidence showing that slow breathing is a fast and effective method of calming down is enormous. It's used in treating anxiety, depression, and PTSD (video - the Stanford PTSD study). Soldiers say that they are able to calm down immediately in dangerous situations by simply slowing down their breathing.  
  
Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg recommend this simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, inhale and exhale 6 seconds each.  
  
Rushing around when you don't have to and doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness.   
  
  
Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind. You can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners' videos on YouTube.  
  
  
Other things take some effort but they're very rewarding - things that make your life meaningful, like a good hobby, art, or volunteer work. Take care of your mental and physical health with the right lifestyle choices.

"I'm taking a training to manage myself more so it will be easier to quit.

There's always a reason why we start using a substance, either to get rid of stressy feeling (caused by not listening to boundaries, stop thinking (as symptom of the stress) or suppress emotions (trauma).

My addiction is because I feel stressed, I've a mental burnout at the moment.

After some observing I became more aware of my habits that could stress me. I came to the conclusion that I'm a dopamine addict in my work (I do tasks faster then the rest) and private (playing games). All stuff that uses mental energy.

So this next weeks I'm changing my habits. I'm giving myself 2 hours of screen time (now I'm on 8). And the rest of the day I spend on doing hobbies, cleaning, exercise and so on. Only activities that don't use a lot of mental energy.

I use both at the moment... but only because I never understood why I felt stressy and what actions I had to take to destress.

Changing my habits will change the need for a substance to suppress the stressy feelings... as I hopefully won't feel stressy any more in some weeks of destressing in the right way."	District9999	reply	na	na	na	0.9991269707679749	no	strong	no	na	stress
"Those are all good points. It is good to do the work and figure out why we do the things we do. I’ve been really thinking back on my life and some of the trauma that ultimately lead me to where I am now. How I allowed people to come into my life and cause more trauma because the original trauma did the damage to begin with, if that makes sense. I used to beat myself up a lot for making poor choices, but all the things that happened in my life and factors outside of my control made me the person I am now. All I can do is recognize what went wrong and try to do better. Having patience with myself has been hard but that’s my focus right now as I am slowing wayyy down on my drinking and smoking weed (I’m using pot to help me thru the withdrawals from alcohol). 

However, I think it’s unrealistic to think the stress with ever go away, in fact I’m sure you have a lifetime of stress ahead of you. There is always going to be stress in your life, it just shows up in different avenues.

"I work at an engineering firm that surveys underground utilities and drain systems. I started work last July and it has been a never ending stream of all consuming stress and anxiety for me. It feels like I can’t escape from work and it never ends, and it feels like no matter how hard I try my work always gets thrown back at me with my boss telling me it’s horribly wrong and that I had no idea what I was doing. It’s not like I don’t ask him for help either, he will review my work and offer revisions, only to go back and find new instances that he didn’t mention before. 
If all I had to do was draft I’d be okay with that. But because the company is so small everyone does every project on their own start to finish, from proposal to cost estimate to survey to drafting to finish. All I know how to do is draft, and because everyone has been so busy I haven’t been able to learn the other skills. 
I’ve also been given another near impossible task that I have been trying to teach myself how to do, but I also haven’t even had time in my work day to do that.

Recently ive been aware of my stressed and  im really tense all the day long. From the time  I wake up I feel a lot of tension in my neck and shoulders an that feeling rarely goes away, sometimes I have can't sleep because of that.  I also exercise 5 days a week and I used to run but I've stopped so im sticking to weight lifting and easy cardio like walking or biking in zone 2, working out used to make me feel happy but recently it has felt like a chore.  im also a full time student, university is really time consuming and a barely have time to do my hobbies, running used to be my stress reliever but is not helping anymore because I have to go for my run at 5am and I go to bed at like 11 if im lucky so I feel like I barely get any rest, so if you have any tips to manage stress please let me know.

"Neck and shoulder pain - I know exactly what you're talking about. One of the best things I've found for this is the lawn chair I bought for relaxing in the back yard. The chair is comfortable and when I rest the back of my neck a certain way on the metal bar at the top of the chair, the pressure eases the tension in my neck. When I take a long hot shower I'll sometimes rub the back of my neck with a towel, and a bit of pressure feels good.  
  
Ergonomics - the pain seems to come from the way I work. It doesn't bother me so much when I'm careful with the way I use my right arm.  
  
As a student, you probably get enough exercise walking around the campus. Therapists say that we're more motivated for natural exercise.  
  
My best advice for stress -   
  
When you're worrying, you're not really thinking. You're just spinning your wheels.  
  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
  
  
One of the best things for stress is to develop good breathing habits. It's very simple, although you might find it a bit hard to develop good habits.   
  
  
A really simple but effective thing - the habit of responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath.   
  
The evidence showing that slow breathing is a fast and effective method of calming down is enormous. It's used in treating anxiety, depression, and PTSD (video - the Stanford PTSD study). Soldiers say that they are able to calm down immediately in dangerous situations by simply slowing down their breathing.  
  
Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg recommend this simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, inhale and exhale 6 seconds each.  
  
Rushing around when you don't have to and doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness.   
  
  
Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind. You can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners' videos on YouTube.  
  
  
Other things take some effort but they're very rewarding - things that make your life meaningful, like a good hobby, art, or volunteer work. Take care of your mental and physical health with the right lifestyle choices.

I also have advice for panic attacks.  
  
The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.  
  
  
Simple distractions can help. The video below shows you distractions that can calm you down, also a safe hotline. No one will bother you if you call.

I put him first making sure he grows up to be a good obedient boy but I forget about me. I feel so bad. I love him so much and I don’t wanna give him away but I know I have to.

A good habit - always respond to a stressful moment by breathing slowly.   
  
When you’re calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say that 10 minutes of slow breathing is good. The exercise they recommend is breathing gently through the nose, 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out.   
   
When you’re worried, think calmly about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.

I guess I got too excited about getting a dog I forgot how much extra work it would be caring for two dogs.

I'll tell you how to kill two birds with one stone - eat right. It's less expensive and better for your moods.  
  
Felice Jacka is head of the Food and Mood Center at Deakin University in Australia and president of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry. Her book Brain Changer separates what is known from the study of nutrition from speculation and myth. It shows that good food costs less. Dr. Jacka and other researchers have confirmed something that has been suspected for a long time - that old-fashioned eating, diets with whole foods instead of highly processed foods, what's sometimes called the ""Mediterranean diet,"" makes depressions less likely.   
  
When I had a financial setback, I looked at ways that I was wasting money. I got of the habit of stopping at places for a bite to eat (lousy junk) and the habit of running out to replace things when they got broke instead of using something around the house in its place or just doing without it because I didn't need it. That saves on gas."	pixelartistjewelie	reply	na	na	na	0.9993636012077332	no	no	no	na	stress

"I’m finically unstable as well, so I can kind of understand what you mean. Thanks to that, I’ve done research in hopes of getting a job. A fine-paying one. 
It may not work for you, but it also might. I think it just depends on what you’re good at. 

An option I’ve personally explored is: 
-Becoming a game creator or create items/clothes and accessories on ROBLOX

It can be especially difficult at first since you’ll need a good amount of knowledge regarding technology. However, if that’s something you’re familiar with or something you can become familiar with in some time, this isn’t a bad idea. Creating games or items on ROBLOX to earn income might sound risky and probably won’t get you much if at all at first. However, if you’re smart about it and hardworking, you can undoubtedly earn some. How much you end up earning entirely depends how often you complete an item or how well and popular the game you made is. It’ll take sometime learning with the tutorials and all that, but if you make items that are popular now or items that are difficult to make but very likable, you have a good chance of making some especially since ROBLOX is a fairly popular game with kids and teenagers who are willing to pay for good items. 

If you choose this option, I could occasionally help out by recommending some item ideas I personally believe would be well-selling. I’ve played this particular game for some years now, so I believe I have some idea what some of the ROBLOX community would like. 

Then again, being a tutor wouldn’t be a bad idea if you’re well taught in that specific subject, good with people, and good at explaining complex factors. 
There’s many options other than these two, so don’t worry too much. It can be a lot, but once you get through this, you’ll be able to enjoy some luxuries along with less stress.

"Yes it sure can affect you. I had an ex who literally had zero “real” problems and had all the money in the world. Multi millions.

So all this started for me back at the end of January. I went to my dermatologist and had a biopsy done. I freak out for a about a week and test results came back clean. The. I went two weeks later because a scab grew on my chest. I got that check out and came back clean. During this time I was freaking out.. stress, worrying, and couldn’t sleep. All this lead to other health issues. I started to have pain in my lower back which shot through my entire body. It was until recently I started to get a burning sensation in my stomach. I went to my dr and he said it was due to stress. I got put on medication to take care of it hoping it works… has anyone else gone through this before? All this happen under one month.

Car issues, our christmas hollidays went very bad.

"I'll show you my best advice for stress, from different sources -   
  
When you're worrying, you're not really thinking. You're just spinning your wheels.  
  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
  
  
One of the best things for stress is to develop good breathing habits. It's very simple, although you might find it a bit hard to develop good habits.   
  
  
A really simple but effective thing - the habit of responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath.   
  
The evidence showing that slow breathing is a fast and effective method of calming down is enormous. It's used in treating anxiety, depression, and PTSD (video - the Stanford PTSD study). Soldiers say that they are able to calm down immediately in dangerous situations by simply slowing down their breathing.  
  
Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg recommend this simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, inhale and exhale 6 seconds each.  
  
Rushing around when you don't have to and doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness.   
  
  
Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind. You can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners' videos on YouTube.  
  
  
Other things take some effort but they're very rewarding - things that make your life meaningful, like a good hobby, art, or volunteer work. Take care of your mental and physical health with the right lifestyle choices.

I lost my job at the end of January and finally was able to start working a few days ago. Through the stress of not having a job, I felt as though I was in the clear and able to focus again. Until I realized that I will not be getting paid until the 17th. I reached out to my leasing office about paying rent late and was hit with a response of “we are now doing evictions, so paying so late might not be feasible.” I’ve had a really tough time these last three years, leaving an abusive marriage, losing my mom unexpectedly, now once again feeling like I have to start my life over. I do not feel like I have anywhere I can turn to. I’m feel like every-time life starts to get on track it gets derailed in some way or another.

With all that you've been through, it seems that you should consider the possibility that you're depressed. Only a doctor can diagnose but a depression screening test online such as CESD R can be useful.  
  
A lot of things can help, mostly things that are easy. If you have reason to believe that you're depressed, I'll be happy to share information about standard treatments and the self-help recommended by therapists.   
  
A good habit - always respond to a stressful moment by breathing slowly.   
  
When you’re calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say that 10 minutes of slow breathing is good. The exercise they recommend is breathing gently through the nose, 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out.

"I’m pretty sure I’m burnt out and I have been for over a month now. It’s gotten so bad to the point I CAN’T work even when I try to force myself to. I thought it’d get better with a break and that I’d get over it just like I always did, but I haven’t and it’s been over a month now. 

Whenever I try to work, I just can’t seem to focus. I can’t no matter how much I force myself to. As soon as I force it, the stress rises and a low mood is bound to kick in even if I was all cheery and positive a minute ago. I thought taking a week long break would do it since it used to, but the break didn’t help much if at all. I have no idea what to do since nothing seems to be working on.

"It's pretty clear that you need help for depression.  
  
The self-help methods for depression are mostly stress reduction - important for people who are prone to depression. Most depresskions are caused by stress.  
  
What I usually tell people who have a problem with money:  
  
1) Your GP may be helpful, perhaps in directing your search, helping you with your priorities, or giving you a prescription. You might get help at Mark Cuban's affordable drug company online. This  company is getting a lot of attention lately. Some are saying that it can radically change the drug industry.  
  
  
  
  
2) There's a variety of things that can help - low-cost, low-risk things that are easy and can be combined with each other. I have advice from experts in my comments.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEM\_jlDRZI  
  
  
  
3) Do research, including study of the online therapy reviews. Healthline, a site I rely on for good information, has an article that rates online services.  
  
Do what you can to get a therapist. You may have to do a lot of research about this. Don't give up. Call your local social services (211?) and ask about Medicaid and Obamacare. Also, you can google ""affordable psychotherapy."" The cost of therapy can vary a lot.

"Burnout sucks and it can feel hard to get back into a ""normal"" rhythm. I would ask yourself what has happened so far that has gotten you to this point? Why are you burnt out? Why can't you work - write out these reasons?   


We usually expect ourselves to bounce back much quicker due to hustle culture perpetuate being 100% productive most of the time. In reality we need a lot of time to recuperate and get back to being ""productive"" again - the quicker we push ourselves back into being super productive, the less productive we become (we're forcing ourselves when we are not ready yet).   


I would recommend my [free workbook](https://view.flodesk.com/pages/62a81fe6d8805abaef3d6788) it is going to show you how to manage the stress you feel whilst trying to do work and make it a less worse experience for yourself.

"Yeah, it really does. 
Not much actually. I’ve just been pushing myself to get all my assignments submitted on time. My Geography teacher used to give us one assignment that’s usually neither easy or too difficult everyday. I think that and my other assignments added up a lot of stress. It wasn’t really the best idea to binge work everyday, I suppose. 

I don’t really know why I can’t work either. I guess I just can’t focus. When I try to work, I become a negative wreck and my focus is easily lost. I do try to prevent that from happening, but it’s never worked so far. I often have to help babysit so not doing anything other than work even when I work is next to impossible. My mood can’t seem to not drop whenever I force myself to work, so I have no idea what I should really do especially with assignments piling up now.

"The fact that you have acknowledged it and are openly speaking about it is a big first step...so kudos to you for that.

Practical/Immediate steps/tools that will help : 

Start exercising if you do not already

Start meditation if you do not already

Start eating healthy/whole foods if you do not already

See a therapist that you trust if you do not already

All of that can sound daunting if you're stressed to the gills / have a lot on your plate...but you can always start small. i.e meditate/walk for 5 minutes a day for the first week, 10 minutes the next, etc.

So, there’s this thing I’ve been dealing with for a while. When my body is under physical stress, or I’m under mental stress, I sometimes get the urge to hiccup. Not a series of hiccups, just one annoying outburst. And I guess I don’t really know if I’d call it a hiccup even. My parents have taken to calling it a “narg” because that’s basically the sound I make during a particularly strong one. Has anyone else ever experienced this before? And is it even really an involuntary stress reaction? It’s been happening for years. I even had an ultrasound on my gallbladder, since my doctors didn’t know what could be causing it. No issues there either. I’d love to hear if anyone has any similar situations.	SleepySquidPop	post	24.364866021412965	female	White	0.009204925037920475	na	na	na	6	stress

And now 2 months after it feels like the stress has built up, and is there just for the sake of it. I feel stuck in the stress trap.

"Female in my mid 30’s here! Sounds like you are experiencing burnout. This happened to me after attending post secondary school while also running my remote business. I also moved house to another province before and after my schooling, which wore me out even more.

I was so sick, beyond exhausted, and on edge. I felt very irritable and mentally, very low. I was no longer my calm and vibrant self and wondered why I was not returning to normal after taking a full day off to rest and sleep. Sometimes I would even have random crying spells out of nowhere. This had never happened to me before, and I was worried that I was going to have some sort of break down. Also, what frightened me the most is that I had lost my work drive and motivation. As someone who has always naturally been a hard worker with a great work ethic, this scared me.

I knew something was up. Did my own research online, went to see my doc and my acupuncturist. They told me my adrenals were destroyed (google “adrenal fatigue and burnout”) and that I had basically fully depleted my body, so I was in fight or flight mode constantly. This was all congruent with the research I did, so the next step was “how the heck can I get back to feeling normal again?”…

The only thing that could reverse this was rest. Serious rest. Not just one day off every week or two. Since I am self employed, I decided to cut my client load down to 30% for 4 months and then I resumed business as usual starting at the 5 month mark, once I had recovered. This allowed me to recharge, heal my adrenals and exhausted mind and body, and regain my enthusiasm and motivation to work again.

During my 4 month recovery period, aside from working part time, I hiked, I read, I gave myself pets mission to have naps, I went for walks, had bonfires, went camping, watched movies at home and at the theatre, listened to enjoyable podcasts and audiobooks, reconnected with loved ones I hadn’t seen in ages. I made sure to eat lots of fruits, veggies, drink lots of water and started taking a high quality electrolyte and vitamin mix with a large glass of water every morning. I started journaling and following 10 minute guided meditations every week. 

In addition to this, I received acupuncture treatments over the course of 4 months. Once a week to start, then once every 2 weeks, then once a month… and now, I only go once every 2-3 months for a “tune up”… If you haven’t tried acupuncture before, look into it. It can help you recover from burnout and adrenal fatigue faster. It can help with easing stress and lowering your cortisol levels and making you feel more mentally calm, as you nurse yourself back to normal.

If you have any questions or want to chat, message me back or dm me. 

I hope this helps and gives you some ideas."	4jayed	reply	na	na	na	0.9966098666191101	no	strong	no	na	stress

"Most people with anxiety disorders do better with therapy (CBT) than with medicine, and some are successful with self-help based on CBT. I can show you some CBT self-help but first I want to say that recently there has been very impressive evidence for therapeutic breathing.  
When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
  
  
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
  
  
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
  
When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.  
  
  
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
  
The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.  
Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.

"If you haven't already, I think it would be a good idea for you to talk with your therapist about the possibility that you're depressed.  
  
My best advice for stress -   
  
When you're worrying, you're not really thinking. You're just spinning your wheels.  
  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
  
  
One of the best things for stress is to develop good breathing habits. It's very simple, although you might find it a bit hard to develop good habits.   
  
  
A really simple but effective thing - the habit of responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath. The evidence showing that slow breathing is a fast and effective method of calming down is enormous. It's used in treating anxiety, depression, and PTSD (video - the Stanford PTSD study). Soldiers say that they are able to calm down immediately in dangerous situations by simply slowing down their breathing.  
  
  
  
  
Rushing around when you don't have to and doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness.   
  
  
  
  
Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind. You can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners' videos on YouTube.  
  
  
  
Other things take some effort but they're very rewarding - things that make your life meaningful, like a good hobby, art, or volunteer work. Take care of your mental and physical health with the right lifestyle choices.

"Yes this is a fairly common symtom of stress. Tics, twitching, muscle spams, small sounds, fumbling for words, switching words up... you name it. I've had all at this point. It can be triggered by sudden stressfull events, long term stress or medication change.

It will go away on it's own once you're less stressed, but once the brain has ""learned"" it, it has a higher likelyhood of coming back.

Don't panic when it happens, it's not really dangerous in itself. Sit down, breathe and get your body to calm down. One way of doing it is by doing grounding exercises. An example is to do the classic check with all senses: find one thing you can smell, one you can feel, one you can see and so on.

I’m not sure, but I feel ya, the last two years I’ve had covid twice, the flu like two or three times, multiple colds. 10 infections (treated with antibiotics too) and strep throat and such. Doctors say I’m a “healthy” individual but idk. When you can’t go more than a month or two without being sick it doesn’t feel healthy… I take vitamins, sleep usually around 8hrs or so, exercise, so on what they all say. I have major stress from PTSD and just my day to day is a lot. I’d say if you’re financially stable, mentally stable, and don’t have a lot of chaos to bring stress that you’ll be healthier… but when you don’t have that then sometimes you’re screwed.

"So, let me start by saying I'm 28 M, and I've been burned out for the last few years and just ""managing to get by."" I work a full-time 9-5 position (got promoted end of last year), I'm studying part-time in college (straight As till this recent semester, 3 courses every semester), I'ma caretaker and I take care of storeruns/bills/necessities for my home, and I have a significant other that I'm going steady with.

So, my job has gotten to become majorly overwhelming, but the salary's great for someone with no degree, and I'm very used to working with this employer and the work that we do—however between an occasionally toxic environment and daily demands that I'm struggling to focus on (due to my burnout), I fear for my job safety and am becoming miserable. This semester, I find myself having no energy to take on my schoolwork after the workday. I had no option for in-person classes, and all of them are reading and/or writing intensive, none of which makes it any better. As a result of these two alone, I've found myself too tired and stressed to desire nutritious foods, and have adopted poor eating habits... Finally, I'm proud to take care of business for my home, and to have a loving and supportive partner... however, I'm really beginning to tire of the workload, and the result it's taking on my mental health. I do not want to fail, nor be fired, nor disappoint my loves ones...

I know ""I'm worth it,"" and must take time for myself, but how? What does that truly mean? My breaks lately are watching a show while eating for a bit, or going to the market to shop for groceries... I haven't truly had a day off, and it's difficult to be ahead when you're working overtime at your 9-5 to catch-up to the constant demands. To my partner, I don't wanna litter our relationship with complaints or my personal woes. I wanna be a hero, an example, and stable... What do I need to do to recharge and get back on track?

"First of all respect to you for having a full time job while following a college degree. You seem to be very hard working and want to provide for your partner. It’s impressive. I think that what fuels it is the desired recognition from your partner, family, boss. You want to please everybody

That said, it seems to come at your own expense as you’re starting to become mentally drained. It also seems to be affecting you physically as you said you don’t eat well anymore and rather stay home during your break watching tv instead of partaking in more ‘healthy’ activities. 

To be honest given all the professional and academic activities you’re undertaking it was a question of time before you would eventually burn out. Having a 40h work weed + university lectures + home assignments and reading that’s just not doable in a 24hour per day scheme. 

I think that you should definitely reach out and ask for help. That could be for instance to ask your employer to decrease your work weed to 32 or 24 hours per week. That would make a huge difference! 

You could also ask your university to get some side help? 

Also your partner are they also at school or simply unemployed? Having to provide for two is difficult nowadays maybe they could also contribute by getting a part time job?

"Some of this sounds familiar to me. I have a fulltime job with high demands, I would do a lot of (unpaid) overtime to try and catch up. I started college as well, it was expected from my work, it was a 2 year course, in the weekends. But after about 3 months I realised I couldn't combine it with my work anymore, it was all just too much, so I quit the course. My performance at work started to become worse, I couldn't focus, so tired all the time... 
The result is: I have been home unable to work for the past 3 months, and I am not getting back anytime soon. Burned out!
I feel guilty and like a failure most of the time. I feel worthless and have developed a lot of anxiety. I need to work on myself a lot first before I will be able to return to my job, which is still my goal. But yes, it sucks and it required massive changes, like quitting the course and bein on sick leave. But if that's what is needed, then so be it.

I think the thing that stops me is worrying about being left alone with my thoughts while I do that- I can't distract myself easily by doing things on my phone because one hand is occupied, and using my phone one handed is harder.

"I'll mention a couple of things that can help with stress, but the way you describe your situation I really wonder if you're badly depressed.  
  
A good habit - always respond to a stressful moment by breathing slowly.   
  
When you’re calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say that 10 minutes of slow breathing is good. The exercise they recommend is breathing gently through the nose, 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out.   
   
When you’re worried, think calmly about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
Here are some things that can help with procrastination.  
  
I can tell you some self-help things but I'm not saying necessarily that these are all you need. Treating a serious case of depression with nothing but self-help is risky.  
  
  
A famous psychiatrist, Abraham Low, said that when we can't control our feelings we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you out of bed, they will obey. Count down from 10 and at zero, move with all your might.  
  
  
Try this when it seems that you're too tired to work. Lie on the couch, close your eyes, and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for 5 minutes. Think in terms of taking it step by step and starting with something really easy.  
  
  
Taking things in baby steps - very important. This is the key to motivation and motivation is the key to recovery.  
  
  
Just 20 min of brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much.  
  
  
This is a motivation trick that's been used in behavior modification programs since the 1930s. If a task seems like it's too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time, and start with something really, really easy. Cleaning - start by cleaning for 3 or 4 min and take a 5 min break. Homework - start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you're going to read by looking at headings, sub-headings, etc.  
  
  
You can even use the baby steps principle for having fun. If you're not getting any enjoyment out of things, here's something people here have said is helpful with that problem. Look all over and do a complete inventory. You should be able to find at least one or two things you like, such as your favorite music or movie. If there's just one movie you like, watch it once or twice. Then, find movies that are like it in some way - with similar story or the same actor. Keep adding to your entertainment supply to give it variety.  
  
  
If you're thinking about professional help, treatment usually begins by seeing the GP, who can give you a referral. I mention referral because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you'd want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day, any symptoms you might have such as change in appetite or sleep, and things in your life affecting how you feel.  
  
  
If you're depressed, I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.

"I can barely move from the nausea, my whole body is heavy and my head feels musty, it feels like the flu I can barely stand up for 10 minutes without feeling violently ill. The thing is, I need to pack to move out today and I've got about half of it to go. I just want to sleep and run away from it all but I can't. I'm exhausted, I've had to clean out all my moms stuff and decide on a place within a month (she died recently and I'm 18). The pressure from everyone to sell the house fast is killing me.

It's not logical, or not practical. Well it's not what everyone else expects of me anyway. So I need some help in managing this sickness so I can get stuff done."	era_of_emnity	post	18.62826398828575	male	White	0.9993616938591003	na	na	na	1	stress

"Hey everyone, i am currently a doctorate student and have been really struggling with mental stress and feelings of not being good enough( with regards to my career). My stress causes impact on my digestion which in turn causes more stress to me. I have been managing my gut health but it relapses every now and then. 

My stress levels mostly come when i have been unable to do an important task in my research or if it takes some considerable time to do them. Additionally, feeling of not being smart enough for my career keeps trickling down at the back of my head (Which i think is the major reason of my stress). 

I do breathing exercises and they have been great in the short term or for that instance but stress keeps coming back. I have been pretty consistent with mindfulness and other things but it always end up coming back. 

Does any one know how long would it take to see some permanent results? (Sometimes, i feel it will be when i get done with my doctorate degree!)"	Beneficial-Base342	post	36.804152367682235	female	White	0.9845877885818481	na	na	na	1	stress
"You're talking about your anxiety, and slow breathing can be good for this. The thing is, when you use slow breathing with cognitive therapy methods for anxiety, this is a great combination. As you can see, slow breathing alone is not that good.

I'll tell you about things you can do, then some info about therapy that may interest you.

When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.

One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.

When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.

Don't make mountains out of molehills.

When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.

Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.

The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.

Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.

Most people with anxiety disorders do better with therapy (CBT) than with medicine, and some are successful with self-help based on CBT. I can show you some CBT self-help but first I want to say that recently there has been very impressive evidence for therapeutic breathing.

Video - a lot of helpful information, including the 3-part program of Brown and Gerbarg -

"Has anyone else felt constant back & leg pain (or even general muscle pain on any part of the body due to stress? 

I have never had back problems, ever. Knock on wood, I’ve had no accidents, no sciatic issues, no joint issues, pinched nerve issues or broken bones etc.

That being said, I’ve been undergoing a lot of stress lately. The pain has been building up for a few days but tonight, I’m experiencing increased pain! Feels like the origin is the right side of my lower back and the pain radiates down through my butt cheek into my calf (pain is not travelling to foot). It‘s not a sharp pain. It’s more of a gnawing, dull but steady pain. Feels as if I’ve been punched HARD several times in the said area and I only get a bit of relief if I curl up in my side in the fetal position. 

I found literature online saying that stress can cause these symptoms but I just find it so bizarre. Am I really that fragile thay stress could cause so much havoc? I’m in my 30s. No major health issues. I did have mild covid 1.5 weeks ago though. The only other thing I can think of is the fact that I’ve been sitting a lot due to studying for exams nonstop. Weird because I’ve spent more time sitting and studying in the past, but had no back issues at that time. 

I will be seeing my doc next Monday so I will update the chat but wow this pain is gnarly."	Ay_theres_the_rub	post	31.000513302499222	female	White	0.9983617663383484	na	na	na	1	stress

New poster here. I am a 54f professional w a history of depression. I notice I’ve developed new habits of rocking (rare) and chin quivering (frequent!, seems intentional, can stop, but the inclination is def increasing). Full transparency: I’ve started drinking a bit more, but no more than I’ve overindulged in the past due to stress. I am under incredible amounts of increasing, unrelenting, and incomprehensible stress these days due to my employer suddenly changing all policies. I never rocked/quivered before these changes. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced rocking and chin quivering in response to stress. And the influence of alcohol if relevant.

"Drinking would not cause those symptoms, but if you're prone to depression, you have to be very careful about alcohol. For one thing, it makes a case of depression worse.  
  
Most depressions are caused by stress, so good stress management can help a lot with that.  
  
My best advice for stress -   
  
When you're worrying, you're not really thinking. You're just spinning your wheels.  
  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
  
  
One of the best things for stress is to develop good breathing habits. It's very simple, although you might find it a bit hard to develop good habits.   
  
  
A really simple but effective thing - the habit of responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath. The evidence showing that slow breathing is a fast and effective method of calming down is enormous. It's used in treating anxiety, depression, and PTSD (video - the Stanford PTSD study). Soldiers say that they are able to calm down immediately in dangerous situations by simply slowing down their breathing.  
  
  
  
  
Rushing around when you don't have to and doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness.   
  
  
  
  
Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind. You can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners' videos on YouTube.  
  
  
  
Other things take some effort but they're very rewarding - things that make your life meaningful, like a good hobby, art, or volunteer work. Take care of your mental and physical health with the right lifestyle choices.

Wow. Thank you so much. I know a lot of this in the back of my mind, but to see it laid out like this is helpful. My worst problem is not being able to form new good habits. I’ve tried every trick, app, everything, to try. But nothing has worked so far. I did start working w a personal trainer every 2 weeks who specializes in people like me—older, not athletic, chronic pain, etc.—and she is also just really great for mental fitness. Maybe I’ll try to attach some of what you’ve mentioned here to the few times in between sessions when I actually exercise. Like breathing. I do have a great app for that—free, developed for police or first responders—called Breathe to Relax. With my Fitbit on, I can literally watch my heart rate decline. But work has gotten unimaginably stressful and it has utterly consumed my thoughts. I’m working to develop a timeline to leave, like updating my portfolio, resume, etc. Anyway, I’m rambling.

"Good ways to form habits:  
  
1) Link habits together. Say to yourself, ""When I \_\_\_, I will \_\_\_."" For example, when you do the slow breathing, use the thinking methods I've told you about for scary thoughts.  
  
2) Use a cue. When you hear yourself stomping, that's a cue to slow down. You shouldn't hear your footsteps. Feeling your stress level go up prompts you to use your coping methods, esp. slow breathing."		reply	na	na	na	0.019329598173499107	no	no	no	na	stress

 for example I was listening to the teacher the whole time and then she asks me something and I don't know what she said.
 and also problems like I want to read something and I can read but I can't understand what I'm reading until I can picture it in my head and that's not easy either and if I can't picture it then I can too  do not understand.
 and in German I've never had any problems with grammar and such and commas and everything just happened by itself and I always wrote a 1 in dictations and now all of a sudden I've made all these grammatical errors that I've made before and still messed them up.

"This is the thing about slow breathing. People say, ""It doesn't work for me."" Well, a hammer works fine for everybody but not if you don't have any nails.   
  
Slow breathing works for everybody in the sense that no matter who you are it has a positive effect on the autonomic nervous system. But it's a tool.

"I’ll try to cut my story short in hope of someone out there being able to help me and guide me as I feel like I can no longer continue living with this feeling.

A general idea about myself is that I am a 22 yrs old medical student. I usually stress and worry a lot about medical school and my examinations, regardless of the fact that I score the highest amongst my batch. 

My story starts the summer of 2021 where I met a girl that goes to the same medical school as I do. Half way through the relationship problems start to arise between the two of us and I didn’t think anything of them as all relationships have their ups and downs. At this time, my partner began to say bad and mean things to me when we fought which initially didn’t affect me as I knew it was because of her being angry (she also reassured me after the fight resolves that she didn’t mean it). This started to escalate in which the problems became more frequent and almost every time I’ve had hurtful things being said to me. This progressively increased till the summer of 2022 (~11 months past for our relationship) which was the same summer in which I would take my Step 1 exam (a really important, exhausting and dreadful exam). At this point I used to always worry about our future and if were are even compatible, I used to have a weird heart clenching feeling that is filled with worry and anxiety, I also used to wake up from sleep several times with my heart racing or wake up before my alarm with the thought of our relationship overwhelming. We had a fight around 3 weeks before my exam which was my last straw and I communicated to my partner at that time that I want to end things as I felt I should communicate to her my true feelings that I no longer feel like I can continue in this relationship or think we have a future together (the things that were said to me where the worse out of all fights). She was devastated, cried and begged for me to give her another chance as she will change herself. I was heistant but decided to give her a chance, it worked out for the first few days but then the same heart clenching weird anxious feeling returned. I tried to battle it and not disclose it to her, but eventually I couldn’t hide it anymore and told her I couldn’t accept and give her another chance (around ~4 days before my exam). The whole 4 days and holiday after the exam was devastating I was really sad and down. With time, I used to distract myself and go out with friends (I don’t drink) almost every other day which helped me try to forget the whole situation. 

Keep in mind that I’ve got several messages from my ex weeks after the breakup about how I was wrong and that she would never forgive me and other prayers. Similarly over the last couple of months (it’s been 6 months since our breakup) I’ve been getting tiktok reposts from her account of videos taking about injustice and how sad/devastated she was which always made me feel very guilty as I was the reason for her current feelings. Similarly, it made me self-conscious about my decisions and doubt my feelings as she claims I never loved her and if I did I would never leave her.

Fast forward to the last month (5 months since breakup) where I finally approached a girl in my class that was always getting my attention and I couldn’t lay my eyes off her. In the first 3 days (through text), I was very happy and excited to get to know her. Three days later (which was also when the new school year started and the week of my important sport tournament) I started to have this same tiring, coruscating and exhaustive heart clenching feeling as if there is something I am worrying about. It started to increase progressively and I’ve always tried to forget it and keep it in the back of my head,, but it has been really taking a toll on me as I almost wake up everyday with this feeling and it stays throughout the day. Keeping in mind that throughout this period we’ve grown really close and she seems to really care about me. I have this feeling in the background around 60% of the day, 20% is me being distracted by work and friends and the remainder 20% consist of me actually overthinking and worrying. I really don’t understand why is this happening:
	a. Am I feeling guilty that I am meeting a new person?
	b. Am I worrying that this new relationship may end like the previous one?
	c. Am I scarred and no longer can commit to a relationship? 
	d. Why is the same feeling (but less intensity) that I was having before I left my ex happening again????
	e. Is the person not compatible for me and I am still seeking my ex?
	f. Did I still not move on from my previous relationship (prior to the new girl I was certain that I did move on and had 0 feelings, but I brought it up now because I have 		no idea what is the reason for this feeling)

Any input can help me understand this feeling that is taking a huge toll on me. 


This is a previous post of what I felt with my ex that I posted 200d ago:

"I’m sorry you are going through this. I have at times (including recently) felt such overwhelming stress that I’ve gone into intense panic attacks that lasted for days. At one point It was so bad I thought I was about to have a stroke but I realized it was a panic attack. 

Maybe you are experiencing a trauma response in your new relationship due to the stress of the last one. Maybe you need more time to heal and focus on yourself. As good as a new relationship may feel, maybe it’s a distraction you don’t need right now, especially while you are in medical school. You are so young and you have your whole life ahead of you. Don’t feel like you need to commit to anyone right now. Maybe just casually date for awhile and take the pressure off yourself. Also, you can’t be a good partner if you are not in the right head space, no matter how bad you want it. 

I suggest making sure you are doing all the basics for managing stress- taking deep breaths and meditating, exercising, eating healthy, staying hydrated, not drinking too much or partaking in other unhealthy habits. Definitely allow yourself some down time and do things you enjoy. Spend some time writing down your thoughts and trying to organize them and get them out of your head. Hopefully this will bring you some clarity and peace."	PumpkinInteresting38	reply	na	na	na	0.9976621866226196	strong	strong	no	na	stress
"This must feel awful and at times worrisome. I’m so so sorry. You have a lot of good ideas to test. But right now, let’s work on that stress. 

It sounds to me like the previous partner liked to fight, which caused a development of the fear and fight/defense response in you, whose sympathetic nervous system was already flooded with stress from study. Each fight with your former partner was like a big day in the gym . Each text, even after it was over was another workout.  Your stress response is a well exercised muscle. This was learned and can be unlearned.

It’s time to create a calm mind in a calm body. Do what you can to manage stress. An exercise program that includes moderate intensity work and relaxation, meditation that examines the role of the mind in your anxiety, and breathing exercises for stress sound like a great start. 

There’s certainly more work to do though. It’s best to find a coach, therapist or other provider to help you through it so that you’re feeling better sooner. Compounding your stress can hurt your learning abilities. All the best to you! I wish you peace and happiness and success!"

"I'm going to show you a comment that has details about general anxiety, but first I'll suggest that you go to some of the sites that have good advice for test anxiety and see what they have in common.  
  
Some recommend responding to a moment of panic by breathing slowly, which is very good.  
  
The times when a student is most likely to panic - the start of the test and toward the end. It's good to look through the test at the start. You can figure out how to pace yourself and find an easy question to start with. If you're running out of time, don't rush, and look for fast ways to answer like a brief outline.

"Before anyone asks, no, the problem is not coming from my supervisor. He’s kind, willing to help and available for me. 

If you ask me I wouldn’t even say that I feel stressed before the meetings, in the sense that I’m not overthinking, I’m not having this bowl of stress in my belly that one could have facing pressure. 

Yet I don’t know why, systematically, 10-5 minutes before the meeting, I go to the toilet and I throw up everything I have, even if I had a light breakfast before. I really don’t know what can I do to stop this because it doesn’t feel like the problem is coming from me. It feels like I have no other choice but to throw up. 

Obviously it’s linked to the fact that I’m going to apply to a PhD and the fact that he’s a very knowledgeable man in his field, and there’s probably a bit of impostor syndrome playing. But what’s worrying me is the fact that of all the 10-12 meetings we had so far, I systematically throw up. I’ve had other meetings with other supervisors when I was a research assistant for instance and it didn’t happen probably because the stakes are lower. What can I do to feel better ?"

"Do you feel the usual symptoms of stress before throwing up ? What if you use some relaxation techniques right before ? Like breathing techniques, maybe sport a few hours before, visualisation (something that really helps me is picturing my happy place or the ""spiral technique"" : close your eyes, represent what you are feeling as a spiral. Make the vision as clear as possible : what is the color, which direction does it moves, how fast is it... Take your time, use a few minutes to really see it.  Then you alter it, you change it's form, the way it moves, the color, I usually do this until I ""dissolve"" it in my mind. I usually feel better afterwards even if it's only for a moment). Maybe some meditation. I guess what I am saying is knowing what works for decreasing your stress and using it at that time. You also must use these tactics even when you are feeling good to get better at using them. 

If you have ruminating thoughts, you can try counting backwards, start at a number 1367 for exemple and substrats three or more each time : 1364, 1361... It's supposed to stop ruminations because it uses your cognitive functions. 

I guess also talking maybe in therapy about what starting this PhD means for you could also help if you have the opportunity. I wish I knew how to get to that point but when I was feeling awful writing my masters thesis, I never knew why that period of my life was so hard even with therapy, I could only use exercises I explained above to cope.

Edit : just saw you said you didn't felt stressed before the meeting, I need to slow down and read the whole post ! What if you imagine having a meeting with him ? Like if you put yourself in condition, picturing you will have a meeting right now ? I think maybe you could try recreating that situation in your mind and stop each time you feel nauseous. So not going until you throw up, each time you feel nauseous you use a relaxation tool to get better and getting used to the idea of having a meeting with your supervisor. If this goes on I think you could also get rid of this réponse with hypnosis maybe. 

On a more practical note, I think mint is supposed to calm nausea ? What if you chew some gum or drink mint tea, maybe some essential oil ?"	PortYanis	reply	na	na	na	0.9992521405220032	no	no	strong	na	stress
"So, you're talking about anxiety, whether or not you're feeling a lot of stress in the minutes before the meeting. I'd think about getting help for this.

Most people with anxiety disorders do better with therapy (CBT) than with medicine, and some are successful with self-help based on CBT. I can show you some CBT self-help but first I want to say that recently there has been very impressive evidence for therapeutic breathing.  
When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
  
  
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
  
  
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
  
When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.  
  
  
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
  
The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.  
Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.

"""Idk if I'd be able to find a guy who likes me if I'm not driving"" - ok that is clear overthinking there. A life partner shouldn't be chosen for such conditional things. If you're expecting a partner to like you for such materialistic conditional things, you won't find the right guy. The right guy would love you for your innate character and personality, your traits. These things matter for a positive relationship. 

It's not compulsory to learn to drive. It's a convenience that makes life easier. A good skill to have. But at the same time, expensive to run and maintain a vehicle. Your decision ultimately. Do consider the expenses.

"Over the past few years - like most ppl - I’ve had a rough time with covid lockdown, plus then I was diagnosed with hiatal hernia, then divorce, and now financial pressures of single-handedly running a household.

I was hoping to put this all behind me but last summer new symptoms started to appear:

+ IBS / GERD (hiatal hernia)
+ Cardiac arrythmias (thousands a day)
+ Various skin complaints
+ Alopecia Barbae (beard patches)

I’ve now had 9 months of all these symptoms and I’ve tried individual meds like beta blockers, PPI, tweaking diet, exercise with no luck… the docs say this is all because of going through  a major life disruption and it’s due to underlying stress. The cardio and gerd stuff is so bad I’ve started avoiding stuff but I have CBT planned as a last resort treatment. Concerned the stress is permanently damaging my health.

Anyone deal with anything similar? Go through a major event and suffer chronic stress? Any of these symptoms? Did they resolve after a time?

I live on acreage now, so “nature” is a little easier. But before that, when solitude on a trail or in a park wasn’t an option, I would focus on what nature “came to me”. Watching/listening to the birds or wind. Staring at the clouds or stars or both, depending on the time of day obviously. The moon has always had a calming effect on me. Admiring trees or flowers or the wild animals in your city. I’ve traveled the world and nature is everywhere. I try to take notice of the things we often forget about when life gets hectic as it does. “Stop and smell the roses” is way more than an idiom.

"I'm moving interstate in 2 weeks, have had a lot happen in my life over the past 4 months, zero support where I currently live and I'm under extreme stress that's destroyed my appetite completely.

I'm losing weight rapidly that I can't afford to lose (I'm very short and already had a small frame so even just 3kg is a huge loss for me, anymore and I'll look like a ghost)

Most of my stressors will leave me when the move itself happens and I'm seeing a new therapist as well then, one better equipped to help me.

"You're most likely just thinking of the same problems over and over, with different perspectives. What helps a lot is to simply end the thoughts - either by meditating or writing. For me personally, writing works best and my mind feels so clear afterwards; give it a try!

1. Write down everything that comes to mind.
2. Highlight the things you can control, and ignore the other.
3. Make a plan to progress in the things you can control."	Cats5205	reply	na	na	na	0.9978925585746765	no	strong	no	na	stress
"When we are stressed we get reduced activity in our prefrontal cortex.  
This means that we have less ability to use this part of the brain.

This part of the brain is responsible for decision making, planning, self control and much more. This leads to not feeling in controll and the feeling of not being able to sort through your thougths.

So the unfortunat thing is that when we get stressed, we have less ability to controll ourselves and not think about the stressful events. Our survival brain that is activated during stress also holds on to  the stressful situations.  


So stress often leads to more stress.  


So what can help is to find activitys that help you to let go of the current state in your brain. When you move out of this brain state you will have more resources to use and solve issues that needs to be handled with.  


This is one of the reasons why exercise is good agains stress, it helps our brain and nervous system to move out of the stressed state."	Cats5205	reply	na	na	na	0.9978925585746765	no	strong	no	na	stress

"Hello all.

I have been on sick leave from work for 3 months now. 
Tomorrow I’m starting slowly again. 3 hours. 

Throughout all January I have had this persistent restlessness. I have been sleeping 4-6 hours every night, woken up, and slept again for 2-4 hours. Getting up at noon. The past two weeks I have tried to get up at 8, to match my work schedule. Now I only sleep 6 hours and stay in bed trying to get in the last two hours. 
It worries me that I’m still not sleeping through a full night.
I’m not sure if it’s stress or my hiatal hernia or my chronic neck pain that wakes me up. But I wake up rather abruptly. So I’m guessing stress. Sometimes I wake up with racing heart.

Speaking of racing heart - I started to get that randomly racing heart throughout the day. I wonder if it’s because I’m starting work and I’m nervous about it. I have social anxiety and I’m trying to fit into this new “me first” mindset. I’m a big people pleaser, but I have had to break with that habit now. Also I keep getting chest pain, I’m not sure if it’s my hiatal hernia or if it’s stress.

Idk what to do. I’m feeling uneasy about not feeling better than I am after 3 months."	ariegnes	post	20.350519614604135	male	White	0.9980851411819458	na	na	na	4	stress
You can’t put a time scale on your healing it will only make it worse. It sounds to me like you put a lot of pressure on yourself. You will get through this, take each day at a time.

"28M, over 3 years ago Ive started a physical job, people Ive worked with gave me hard time indirect bullying, mind games, was always told I was “shit at the job”.

This went for 20 months dreaded going in would let it out by crying when I was alone mainly because I believed I shouldn’t be there and I’m not good enough.

Struggled to fall asleep, depressed anxious low self esteem and as also a big people’s pleaser Ive constantly tried to “make my uselessness up to them” by doing more and trying to nail everything at 110% and still not good enough.

Ive had developed a cyst on my neck and then they’ve accidentally found thyroid cancer (it was very mild) and when I was laying there in the hospital nothing else really mattered but the people that care about me and seeing them upset even though Ive only had a small procedure.

Had few months to think and stopped punishing myself with difficult goals and stopped being everyones friend too. Ive accepted that i am who I am and if I try to change it it will be in my own time and only because I choose to do it because if something bad happens like you get a horrible diagnosis all those worries and stresses go away they don’t matter anymore and are so irrelevant. 

Ive began taking my life day by day or week by week looking after myself and people who really care about me and if i don’t feel like doing something I don’t do it. I’ve stopped putting pressure on myself and slowly try to really enjoy my life because you never know when it ends.

But do not be afraid to ask for help even professional help. Start with changing things for the better but slowly with small goals in front of you and rewards yourself whenever you achieve them and if you dont then do it tomorrow. Respect and care for yourself, be confident in yourself and appreciate every single day.

Whenever I get a package of plain M&Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M&M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion. There can be only one.	Apprehensive_Form367	reply	na	na	na	0.0023923253174871206	no	strong	no	na	stress

Yes, scratching, picking, nails and skin are self-soothing behaviors that are often related to stress. These behaviors are often a way to release tension or anxiety, and can become habits in response to stressful situations. Additionally, these behaviors can also become a source of stress, as they can cause skin damage and exacerbate anxiety and feelings of shame or guilt. If you feel the urge, then know it’s a good time to take a long deep breath, be kind to yourself, and relax.	Fantastic2930	reply	na	na	na	0.9991686344146729	no	strong	no	na	stress
"Do you have psoriasis? I had it before and it was very bad. About 70% of my hands were scaly, red, bleeding, extremely itchy and it looked like my hands were burned. Because of stress and anxiety i picked at the scales with my fingers and teeth, i could stop but i always felt compelled to bite it and actually picking it made me feel weirdly amazing. Then they would start bleeding and hurting, though it was better than the itch i would have constantly, it in turn made me more stressed. Its a cycle: Stress>itching>pick the skin>Stress.

Beside skin picking, i still compulsively bite nails, pull hair and i'm pretty sure its because of stress or anxiety."	Fantastic2930	reply	na	na	na	0.9991686344146729	no	strong	strong	na	stress
"What you're describing is a pretty common stress / anxiety response: often with similar root causes as nail-biting, lip-chewing, pinching, hair-pulling and other behaviours which can become habitual responses over time. In my work as a therapist, I see this type of thing frequently. 

While everyone's experience is unique to them, there are general patterns and correlations to the behaviour and stress / anxiety levels - which the behaviour itself can add to. often, clients can find themselves in a vicious cycle which is beyond tiring: it is exhausting.

Thankfully, there is alot we can do to help people in this, and similar, situations. It revolves around reducing the overall stress / anxiety levels and learning how to keep them low so that the client can be free to live their best life.

For me, I was a lot stressed last couple of years and I have noticed that i became more alert when I am in new/unfamiliar situations (mostly thinking negatively).

"@nobody202342 gave good advise. In addition to that, I'll suggest you to check for nutrient deficiencies in vitamin D and B12, as these deficiencies can cause many different kinds of mental disorders, like anxiety, panic, depression, negative irrational thoughts, overthinking. normalisation of levels diminishes these problems. It's quite MIRACULOUS how this works. speak with a doctor about getting blood tests done for vitamin D, B12, folic acid. If deficient, supplement under the care of a doctor till your levels normalise. 
But DO NOT take supplements without checking your blood levels. You only need them, and they'll only resolve these symptoms, IF you're deficient in them.

Next, feeling nervous, overthinking and always alert is a clear sign your system is overstimulated. Overstimulated system just cannot rest and be at peace. Therefore, I will advise you to cut out or at least minimise the following from your life: caffeine, alcohol and everything that contains added artificial sugar. they are stimulants, notorious for causing anxiety, restlessness and overthinking. If you're consuming these regularly in your life, such symptoms are highly likely to manifest. High sugar consumption is even worse, my friend. It causes instability of blood sugar, which causes anxiety. People have experienced improvement in similar symptoms to yours when they quit these stimulants. So you try this yourself and see the difference it makes in your life. You'll benefit. Cutting processed foods in general from one's diet has been shown to resolve anxiety, depression and other issues. What we eat makes a huge difference to our mental state. In Western diets, these stimulants are very common, which is why you see a large proportion of the younger population suffering from such abnormal mind and physical problems. Give a long serious thought to this. Shifting to a Mediterranean diet is best, in general, for humans. It's research proven to lower anxiety and other such issues. 

Please meditate. meditation activates the parasympathetic or 'rest and digest' response. When you're stressed or habituated to stressing out, you're in fight or flight mode, opposite of rest and digest mode. Meditation brings you to rest. Over time, through regular daily consistent practice, your mind becomes habituated to this relaxed peaceful state of being, you will not be affected by stressful events as much as you used to. You'll benefit so very much from this, so I urge you to start meditating.

There are multiple YouTube channels that include GUIDED SLEEP MEDITATIONS. They're extremely soothing and relaxing. Guaranteed by the end of these sleep meditations you'll have a smile on your face, filled with joy. they're very effective to mitigate anxiety /panic / depression / worrying, basically any negative state of mind, the MORE you listen to them. Your mind will be distracted from your worrying thoughts and these positive uplifting empowering thoughts will replace them, thereby promoting positivity and resilience within you. They promote good quality sleep as well, just what you need. Just read the comments below the videos; you'll see just how many people have improved their sleep, achieved a calm worry free State, manifested happiness within them through these videos. Make them a regular part of your life and see the miraculous difference they make. Some amazing channels you can check out: Soothing Pod - Sleep Meditation and Bedtime Stories, Relax For A While, Down to Sleep, Happy Minds - Sleep Meditation and Bedtime Stories, Jason Stephenson - Sleep Meditation Music (includes great meditations), Michelle's Sanctuary: Sleep Stories and Meditations. (Note: avoid listening to negative emotions inducing stories, like those from crime/horror/mystery/suspense/thriller genre. Your anxiety will worsen due to these.)

These guided meditations, if you listen to them in bed while sleeping or resting every day, that'll be akin to a consistent daily meditation practice.

I hope you feel better soon. 😇👍🏻✨

"Last year alone . I stressed a lot . I actually told myself I’m so stressed . I feel like I could die from this level of stress . Well it almost got me . 

Start of last year . 
- stress induced stomach ulcer 

4 months later 
- stress induced IBS 

6 months later 
- started grinding my teeth 

8 months later 
- teeth grinding now caused tinnitus , ear pain , jaw pain . 

So because of stress I have facial pain , stomach pain , intestines issues , worn teeth and worst of all 24/7 tinnitus and ear pain .

I feel you. I have the same issues and have been grinding my teeth due to stress for over 10 years now. It has gotten worse with time and my anxiety triggers often and easily. Probably because I never sought treatment for my mental health. I’m doing that now but rest assured your physical health isn’t  permanently ruined. Just get proper care as soon as you can, see a therapist and a TMJ-specialised dentist and osteo.

"I’ve been super stressed and anxious lately because of a lot of stressors at home plus feeling like I have no one to share them with. My family has been going through insane amount of financial issues and debts so I don’t know if this is a cause // effect. 

In the past 5 months I’ve diagnosed myself with all types of cancers ( because I had blood in my stool due to hemmoroids ) I’ve had swollen nodes in my neck etc. 

My body has acted out in all kinds of ways over the past few months and I’ve been visiting all doctors where nothing major has been diagnosed but I can’t stop worrying. I had got my blood work done 3 months ago and it was all good, now with the body pain I feel like getting it again because I feel like some new cancer mah have developed. 

The past week has been literal hell where my muscles are constantly extremely aching. My legs have been so sore, I wake up every night from 2 AM to 5 AM with leg // stomach pain and anxiety attacks plus my guts have been churning and I’m constantly worrying about things. 

Has anyone else got these symptoms weird anxiety symptoms ? Sometimes I don’t even realise that I’m clenching my leg muscles they ache so much. 

Sorry for freaking out and posting about all of this. I’ll appreciate some good vibes / validation

Yes. I get spasms in my arm and legs from clenching during stressful times. I am trying to be at better noticing it when it starts so that it doesn't cause so much pain. Also don't try to force a stretch or exercise when you are too tight, you can hurt yourself. Breathing exercises, showers and anything that can relax will help. Hope you feel better soon and your family's challenges resolve too.	Annoyedandtired12	reply	na	na	na	0.9967114925384521	no	strong	no	na	stress
"I read all this. I have a few things I want to inform you. 

Firstly, stress can indeed wreck havoc on one's system. Cause chronic diseases. 
Your family issue must be negatively influencing you, increasing your worry, adding to stress. The solution is to not allow it to affect you. Easier said than done, yes. But there's no other way to solve _this_ particular issue, ie. the only way the stress from this family problem won't affect you is if you CHOOSE to not let it affect you.
How? By internalizing the fact that this problem is TEMPORARY. Not permanent. One day, these financial issues will end. better days will come. Till then, it's a matter of adjusting to the current situation with strength and resilience. Action wise, be frugal with spending. Only spend on necessities. No spending on non- essential goods+ services. 

Secondly, self diagnosing cancer or any disease or constantly worrying that you have some health problems, despite medical check ups proving otherwise, is a classic sign of health anxiety. I'll encourage you to read my comments in this post, where I advised OP on ways how to overcome health anxiety, relaxation practices, plus info on GUIDED SLEEP MEDITATIONS which will empower your mind with positivity. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/105iz1q/health_anxiety/

Lastly, this particular advise is just additional; if you take it seriously, you'll benefit massively. Upto you. quit caffeine, alcohol and everything that contains added artificial sugar. they are stimulants, notorious for causing anxiety and overthinking. Sugar is even worse, my friend. It causes instability of blood sugar, which causes anxiety and depression. People have experienced improvement in similar symptoms to yours when they quit these stimulants. So you try this yourself and see the difference it makes in your life. You'll benefit. Cutting processed foods in general from one's diet has been shown to resolve anxiety, depression and other issues. What we eat makes a huge difference to our mental state. In Western diets, these stimulants are very common, which is why you see a large proportion of the younger population suffering from such abnormal mind and physical problems. High sugar and processed food intake causes inflammation. Inflammation is the root of multiple diseases, including muscle pain, gut abnormalities, swelling. Hemorrhoids are inflammation. stress is associated with increased inflammatory activity.
So in summary, you must mitigate external life stressors (cut them out or become resilient to them+incorporate relaxing activities) and reduce or cut out inflammatory foods in your diet. Doing both will speed up your healing.

It's great you got blood work done. But did you check the following: blood levels of vitamin D and B12? If not, I highly advise you to check for nutrient deficiencies in vitamin D and B12, as these deficiencies can cause many different kinds of mental disorders, like anxiety, panic, depression, muscle pain, negative irrational thoughts, reduced ability to cope with stressors, digestive issues, so much more . normalisation of levels diminishes these problems. It's quite MIRACULOUS how this works. speak with a doctor about getting blood tests done for vitamin D, B12, folic acid. If deficient, supplement under the care of a doctor till your levels normalise. Take this advise seriously. 
Because prolonged periods of stress can deplete one's body of these nutrients, causing them to become deficient. Stress is this damaging. a calm peaceful state of being is essential for these nutrients to stay within normal levels in our bodies, for our body to function efficiently and for us to be healthy.

"i’m in the same situation, years of issues with stomach with pain in my hip. finally getting more tests/consult with GI but it’s weeks away, so until then i’m just like constantly worrying. i’m a bit older than you so even more worrying it’s serious since i’m getting middle aged. but i also know i have chronic stress so that could be the cause instead of fucking cancer. i WONT KNOW until the tests. 

that’s the killer part, that sometimes u try to live your life and not stress, but then when the chronic pain is still there, you feel stupid for “living life” and not nagging the doctor more, pushing for more tests. reading about medical neglect online DOES NOT HELP, so i have to stop myself. 

i keep trying to tell myself that there’s always going to be a reason to worry. so whether THESE tests come out good or not it doesn’t matter. i still have to stop my anxiety and worrying. 

again, posts about cancer on twitter caused me to spiral, so i decided to stop going on there as much (along with other internet shit). i tried journaling and it kinda helped… i guess it’s supposed to let us get all the panic out on paper so you can move on… i think there’s some truth to that! but it doesn’t take the stress completely away. i also got exercise equipment so i don’t have to leave the house to get my heart rate up. i think it’s helping but it’s only been a couple of weeks. everyone says exercise helps, so you should try it too if u don’t already.

I've tried meditation, stretches, heat therapy. It does help but I can't just address my stress when it surfaces. I have to figure out how to keep it under control during normal life so as to avoid getting to this point.

"TLDR : 3 questions at end regarding how to not care to disappoint when team and boss have seen my abilities. Boss has high aspirations for me this year or which if I fulfill I’m going to stretch myself so thin that I will leave or go into depression.


I was given a rather good yearly review, and well incentivized, but I am currently stressed, and trying to figure out how to have less responsibilities, when it’s desired I have more. This is above and beyond the rest of my team.

Boss sees my “potential” and not only wants it to continue, but also have me lead more, be more of a driver and influencer, and upgrade my knowledge, cross-team visibility. All of which I do not want. Taking on any more work feels like I’m going to “pop” and I’m already near / at burnout.

I hate disappointing and failing (why I try harder than others on my team; and also why I’m hate being in this position I am right now) but I’m at my max currently near / in burnout, thinking or ways to get out. My mindset is that I’d rather quit a 6fig job and go elsewhere / take a break than disappoint and fail someone whom believes in me so wholeheartedly, and knows how fast I can operate.

Sadly I’ve “shown my hand” this past year of what I’m capable of, but it’s unsustainable for my stress levels, needed downtime, and resetting ability. And more is desired. I’ve mentioned already to the boss that I’m burning the candle at both ends, but it’s only been sprinkled throughout the year. I also hate that I would them regret providing a large optional incentivized reward. Additionally if I fail it’s most likely no more of that and I would just be considered “middle of the road”. I’m OK with that if someone didn’t know my abilities, but again I have pushed past 120% capacity many times for tight deadlines and to get things done.

- How do I change my mindset to not care about disappointing 
- What, if anything, do I tell boss? I feel I need to drop hints that this is too much and if I’m dead it does no one good. ( absolutely sucks feeling capable but also having a hapicapied weakness of stress leading to depression.)

"Is it caused by something you can remove from your life? High stress job? Task buildup? The “treatment” depends on what is causing stress. Can you speak with a doctor (either a gastroenterologist or a psychiatrist, or both)? 

Tbh, i only felt gastric-stress during a very short period of my life: I had a very high-stress job that didn’t pay much and had very little support from my boss. I ended up quitting that job (mostly because I found out it wasn’t even a legal business at the time of my departure - that caused me to not even give notice, sadly burning that bridge). Immediately after, the gastric issues stopped. I don’t think that i would have been able to manage the gastric symptoms without removing myself from that environment; which isn’t all that helpful for a cause that you cant really avoid. 

I realize thats not an option for everyone; my siblings (high school age) deal with stress-related gastric issues and have to take medicine and have adjusted their diet to include a lot of probiotic stuff. It sort-of helps, but their stress comes from very demanding school schedules, which they can’t exactly escape. So from time to time they still experience gastro symptoms. I think learning to better manage their time, prioritize what is important to do well (for their goals) vs what they can let “suffer” in terms of grades has also helped.

I think it kinda just depends on whats causing it. Figuring out the root cause and dealing with THAT should help. There doesnt seem to be an “easy” fix for that level of stress."	Gay_commie_fucker	reply	na	na	na	0.9921941757202148	no	no	strong	na	stress

"It seems you're prone to stress. In that case, it becomes more important for you to minimise or cut out stressors. As many as you can. As much as you can. I want you to prioritise this. Stress can cause the most horrendous chronic diseases, making you suffer for life. Get rid of stress and life becomes a beautiful journey.

There will be stressors you can't avoid. But those that you can, please do. By avoiding, I don't just mean physically. Mentally too. So a bad grade, don't let it upset you. Accept it. Forget it. Work hard next time. Remember, you won't always pass. Failure is a normal part of life. If you forget this failure and move on, you'll drastically reduce unnecessary stress on your mind.

Every bad event in life is temporary. Internalize this. That's why it's NOT worth stressing over. this is a mindset you have to develop. By practice. Daily. That everything is temporary. So not worth stressing over. Times change. 
You will be better off writing this down on a piece of paper and reading this frequently, to drill it into your brain. Over time, you'll see yourself not stressing so much over unnecessary things."	Gay_commie_fucker	reply	na	na	na	0.9921941757202148	no	no	no	na	stress

"Please don't stay hungry. Eat when you're hungry!

 Know this... if you stay hungry, your blood sugar levels will become unstable, most likely go down, which can cause anxiety and further stress on your system. You're harming your health badly. Your brain needs food as fuel to function efficiently. If you stay hungry, you won't be able to think straight, let alone study, perform your best at work, socialize with joy. 

I'll recommend stress resolving strategies to you to help you become competent to manage the stress in your life. I urge you to incorporate these. Don't ignore them. You might not be able to get rid of all stressors in life, but you must develop the strength and skills to manage it, perhaps even to the point where it doesn't affect you anymore. With practice and the right knowledge+tools you can achieve this. I'll show you how.

You must meditate. The impact of meditation on digestive health is highly beneficial, as meditation activates the parasympathetic or 'rest and digest' response. When you're stressed or habituated to stressing out, you're in fight or flight mode, opposite of rest and digest mode. Meditation brings you to rest. Over time, through regular consistent practice, your mind becomes habituated to this relaxed peaceful state of being, you will not be affected by stressful events as much as you used to. 
Deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises. Highly recommend to you. Learn them.
Best for mental health and digestion.

I recommend you join Mindfulness, Meditation, Simple Living, Minimalism, Self Improvement subs on Reddit. You will learn alot of good things. Be inspired to live like the people in these subs (you'll see they're happier than the norm), plus incorporate meditation and other such practices you'll come across there."

"Hi, I was like you not too long ago and I still suffer with insomnia. I also often use sleep to get away from my trouble but too much sleep gives me horrible nightmares. I saw a psychologist once and she gave me strict rules to follow and it definitely made me feel better. 

1) Try to make a sleep schedule, it does not have to be a go to bed at 11pm and wake up by 7am kinda thing but something you can follow. (Mine is go to bed by 1am and wake up by 10am)
2) DO NOT take naps in the afternoon as it will affect your sleep cycle, no matter how tired you are do not go to sleep in the afternoon
3) I take melatonin and camomile tea and I find that it helps me go to sleep. However too much gives me nightmares.

Regarding dreams, I used to have really really horrible nightmares but I find that talking about them to someone really helps. You will eventually realise how silly (sometimes) they can be. However don’t discount your feelings.

I'm not an English speaker. Recently, I moved to a country (non-English speaker either) for a job (that only uses English). Everyone I’ve dealt with has some international background with a good spoken English or is native.
It's my first international position and my first time living abroad. And I've never been so stressed with my spoken English.
Last week, twice during a meeting, my boss mentioned it in front of everyone. Everyone with such a diverse background compared to my mediocre one. Since this situation, my confidence has disappeared, and I have felt that my spoken English has worsened.
At the same time, I've been so paranoid about it, that I noticed some behaviors that worried me (like being fixed on only consuming English content, avoiding and culprit myself for even thinking in my native language).
I'm petrified. I feel I'm losing the respect of my colleagues...

It's possible that your English is better than you're giving yourself credit for and you're fixated on it because it feels like something you have control over in this world of unknowns. 

The other thing to consider is for the new people at your job -  who knows how long they've been there, and who knows how long they've been speaking English.  Language is a skill that is developed over time with tons of practice. Anyone who has studied a second language SHOULD have some empathy for what you're doing. 

I give you tons of credit. Every time I've tried to learn a new language I get overwhelmed. You've put yourself outside your comfort zone in a new place with a different language.

I am a college senior and lately I have been stressed to the point that it has been affecting my sleep schedule. Currently I am taking a gap year to retake some prerequisites and study for the MCAT med school, I don’t live at home due to my school being far away, but I am stress that I have to be at home and study for it. I didn’t have my own room before I left to college. I had to lose one of the unused rooms in my house as my personal room, unfortunately, my parents decided that they prefer this room compared to the master bedroom. It was fine at the moment because I was away at college and I had a house near my school. Now that I’m about to graduate and hopefully move back home to save money I have brought up this issue if I could get the room back but instead of hearing me out, they had stated that I can just go to the library study. I am not sure whether or not I should just suck it up and move back home or save up enough money to move out officially. Any advice would be wonderful!

"Hello and sorry for the stressful predicament. Congrats on dedicating yourself to the MCATs and good luck! Moving itself is stressful, it's rough not to be heard, and the conditions you mentioned are important. Let's break this down.

1. Moving home to save money is a good idea. How much would it save? Assign a number between 1 and 100 to that. What's the cost of looking for another place to live in terms of money and hassle? Assign a negative number to that.
2. What's the value of being able to study in the room you want versus the one your parents want to give you? Assign a number between 1-100 to that. Also, is there a way to re-address the issue with your parents if it's very important? 
3. What is the social, supportive value of being with family, if any, positive or negative? Assign a value to that.

Now look at those numbers and multiply by some factor that indicates eaches importance to you. Add other factors and weightings if they come up.

The fall semester ended for me in mid-December, and I resume for the spring semester in a week. I'm reflecting on the time I spent while having absolutely no academic, social, or financial responsibility... to say the very least, I'm not very pleased with how I dedicated my time. Much of it was spent sleeping, binge-watching shows, cooking, and staying inside. I did get some important things done, but I can't help but think, ""why couldn't I have done more?"" I had hoped to do some exploring or go out more frequently to enjoy the outdoors. I'm disappointed in myself for not doing so.

At the same time, I'm reminding myself that I needed to not do anything for a whole month after a year and a half of consecutive working. This was my first break in a really long time. I'm just upset about how unwisely I spent it... I don't know.

"I’d see what kinds of health services are available through your university.  Either is good for managing anxiety but personally I’d go to a doctor because they can order tests if they want to rule out other causes and can prescribe medications and therapy (if you have insurance for counselling, they may require a doctors prescription for therapy to be covered). 

I’ve done both medication and therapy.  Therapy I felt more empowered and less alone, but medication (low dose Lexapro - a SSRI) is what made the physical symptoms disappear.  I decided to stop after a few years and the symptoms did not return.

Edit:  Also I get the fear but it’ll be okay if you ask for help.  Doctors deal with digestive and mental health issues all the time so won’t be surprised and should know how to help you.

"I applied for a masters program in a field that I’m really passionate about. I was actually accepted into the program the year before but because of funding issues, I had to turn down the offer. 

This year I made sure to apply for many different scholarship and have managed to secure partial funding at least so it seemed like everything was looking up for me! 

Then last month my laptop was stolen (really scary situation that I’m not gonna into detail about) and I’ve had to email the university using my cell phone instead of my laptop like usual. I realized I’ve been sending draft emails through to the admissions office and associate prof while I was trying to save them and I genuinely just want to cry and give up. 

It’s such a stupid mistake and given the lack of response on the professor’s part I’m thinking this might ruin my chances. I was so proud of my personal statement and had really solid references but now I’m doubting everything about my application and myself.

I would say, explain your mistake (shortly), then send the correct thing. Chances are they will understand! If not, they are being obtuse.

I have been down with stress since mid November, and I have started up working again part-time from mid-December. I now have to travel (by plane) for work, which previously triggered my stress, because of all the people, noise and business of the airport and transportation. It took me a week to get over all the stimuli of the last travel day. I now have to travel in late February, and my mind can't stop thinking about it, and I am afraid that I will use another week to get over it again. So how do l deal with a previous trigger? Travelling is part of my job, and I want to overcome the fear	mimsen100	post	56.23956223684606	female	White	0.0134798688814044	na	na	na	2	stress
Whenever I travel by plane/bus/boat with a lot people, noise, stimuli, I wear my noise cancelling headphones. They are amazing. Just cancelling all that outside noise and putting on my favorite music or podcast really helps me a lot. During travel, I also listen to some guided meditation and do breathing excersizes to help me calm down and re-direct my focus. If i feel stressed afterwards, I try to write it all down in my journal, not only the negative but also really try to write some positive things down. It can anything positive really! Hope this helps.	mimsen100	reply	na	na	na	0.0134798688814044	no	strong	no	na	stress
"Ugh- I so feel you on this.  I'd suggest talking to a therapist to work on this if you do want to recover for good. That aside if it were me I'd be telling myself that this next time will be better bc you are getting more comfortable with it. I'd second the noise canceling headphones.  Get a lot of distractions ready: games for phone, a to-do list for work, a book etc.

I've also in the past made a list of things to do that exceed the duration of my flight and each time I finish one I Cross it off and find another to do. I even sometimes include what percent of the trip the task is. I've done this in a linear way like 'draft emails for x,y,z, 2- watch movie, 3-...."". The idea is to get them all done before arriving!  It helps me think of small brainless tasks including fun stuff (play solitare - read 1 chapter- whatever).

I have my first travel since Jan 2020 coming up and am sick with stress and have been ruminating like crazy (and not sleeping well).  Trying to visualize the trip going well and think of fun stuff to do when I get there and get home.  I have moments where I want to just cancel - despite the drama that'd result. Other times I'm more like 'I've got this (sorta).'. In any case I will follow replies to see what other ideas you get!

"Since you don’t have a reason, it sound likes it could be general anxiety.  I struggle with it and find that physical exercise is the most effective tool to combat stress.

 I am a MA level clinical mental health counselor and was recently certified as a Yin Yoga Therapy Instructor. Though I cannot offer individualized/catered sessions, I do provide yin yoga classes on YouTube (@wildheartyogahh) as a free resource to help those who may not be able to afford help in other ways. Many people store emotional energy in the body- specifically in the fascia, since 80% of nerve pathways end in the fascia- and yin targets release of fascia and connective tissue through long (3+ min), passive holds. It is a wonderful, gentle practice, for the mind and body! Hope it can help someone. :)	WHYH2	post	44.65606163186868	female	White	0.0011750131379812956	na	na	na	1	stress

"Thats fair, but tbh… the less busywork you have, the less clutter there is in your mind keeping you from making those big decisions. It really IS very helpful to have someone else doing the day-to-day administrative/middle-management tasks so that you, as a CEO, can focus on making those decisions and preparing for meeting with other companies/investors. They definitely have a lot of stress, but i think its a bit different than the type of stress “normal” people have, which is usually being super bogged down by deadlines and office culture. I feel like the “normal” stressors are a lot more negative than the types of stress that CEOs deal with simply because it feels more like you are a cog-in-the-machine (whereas the stress of a CEO is more personal but the reward for overcoming it is much better). 

I guess negotiating with prospective-investors is probably where the bulk of the stress would come from for a CEO. I don’t have an answer for how they manage that, but i also think that a lot of CEOs have very “dream big”/entrepreneurial personalities that help them express their visions to people and make heavy decisions despite the stress. I think many CEOs have a certain baseline “excitement” that helps them channel that stressful energy into something productive rather than it being debilitating. A lot of them seem to crave that near-anxious feeling. Successful ones, anyways. 

Idk. It seems like there are certain personalities more fit to withstanding the job of being a CEO. Even a lot of those “weighty” decisions are made with a team of people advising them, so even though it ends up being the CEOs responsibility, its not like its all SOLELY their decision. Definitely a lot of team effort involved that helps cut down on that stress."	Sea_Code_3050	reply	na	na	na	0.001483565429225564	weak	no	no	na	stress

Another Situation Like The Above :

I have got a girlfriend recently its been like 5 months and we meet in person twice or thrice in a month, and I met her yesterday too, when I am with her I pretty much enjoy everything, the feeling of hugging her, kissing her, and just doing stupid things together, but as soon as I drop her home its like all the memories just fade away, right after I drop her home I forget the feeling of huggin her, kissing her. I usually took this for granted all the time but yesterday after dropping her at her home tears started coming out of my eyes because of how much I hated this. I actually don't have anyone to talk about this with neither can I go to a therapist or whatever, can anyone please please please help me a little bit. 
I will appreciate it a lot.

In short its just like when I am doing something I will enjoy it and be present in that particular situation but as soon as I leave I am gonna forget everything about it.

"On a biological level, this is the advise I can give you. I highly advise you to check for nutrient Deficiency s in vitamin D and B12, as these deficiencies can cause many different kinds of mental disorders, like anxiety, depression, negative irrational thoughts, overthinking, cognitive decline, memory problems, trouble with focus and concentration, altered State of mind. normalisation of levels diminishes these problems. It's quite MIRACULOUS how this works. speak with a doctor about getting blood tests done for vitamin D, B12, folic acid. If deficient, supplement under the care of a doctor till your levels normalise. This might be affecting you currently.

Thyroid problems can also cause it. But there have to be more noticeable symptoms, in this case. So it's more likely you have nutrient deficiencies.
If you're not eating a nutritious healthy diet, and are loading yourself with junk food, it's likely you'll be deficient in vital nutrients that encourage efficient brain functioning, i e. optimal memory. 

That being said, you know something? There are many people out there who struggle with being present (in the moment) and struggle to enjoy the present moment, like you're able to do. They have anxiety issues, so their mind keeps wavering between past and future. They would give anything to just enjoy the present moment.
And here you're bothered by the very thing that makes life enjoyable. 

Memories don't make life enjoyable, my friend. Living the present moment by being *fully conscious* of every experience is what makes life enjoyable. Once that moment is gone, it becomes a memory. Memories don't exist, so they're of no value. Stop expecting pleasure from them. You're fortunate that you can enjoy the present moment so well, therefore you should. Stop overthinking so much.

There's a trend these days where people who used to click pictures (to keep memories) are changing their mindset. So now they prioritise actually ""living"" out the experience, i.e. being present in the moment, rather than wasting precious time clicking pictures. It's not the pictures that matter, but the sensory experience of sounds melodies, fragrant smells, emotions, loved ones/pets touching you, the wind on your skin, the sun's heat on your skin, the water your feet sink in at the beach, the strawberry flavoured ice cream, etc. Can pictures or memories allow you to *live* all this? 

If you forget, forget it. It doesn't matter. As long as you have loved ones with you, an education, a home, good food, good health, and so on, just enjoy all this and move on."	IntrovertedAH	reply	na	na	na	0.9994643330574036	no	no	no	na	stress
"Similar things have happened to me honestly I get what your saying. Honestly I’m not a doctor or anything but this reminds me of myself like something happy would be going for me but sad thoughts get in the way. Like I had a chance at a relationship once and multiple times but it gets ruined because all I can think about it bad stuff that has happened and sad things. I would just have no reaction also and just stare wondering what’s wrong. In my opinion I feel like it could just be your mood changing I go through it because ever since a loved one passed away for me it’s like I’m one person with my friends and I instantly forget the fun we had once I go home and I feel so lonely and just hopeless and broken down to where I feel like I can’t do anything. Honestly I have learned that 2023 is a year to be a new person but I feel like I want my old self back more than a new person in me.

In positive psychology, it's a practice called gratitude, which made you feel good. It's where you notice the good things in your life, and appreciate them. Savor, absorb, and really pay attention to those good things. write these things down and read them frequently, so that you feel more positive emotions like you just did after reading that Last line.

Try do some nice self care things for yourself and you'll see all the good that's around as well and hopefully lower any stress you've been through.

It really helps to read a book you enjoy in bed just before you sleep. You can try meditation again a little bit you go to bed. Practicing meditation on a daily basis can also help to relieve some of these symptoms that are usually caused by stress such as insomnia. If there something on particular that is keeping you up like thoughts, have you tried talking to a friend or family member?

"I dislike the word perfectionist, I don’t think I’m better than anyone, but it’s what I’m called a lot.

I feel the need to do everything to the highest level. I start working on university essays weeks in advance and don’t submit them until the last minute and I still feel like I could of done better. I rewrite sentences multiple times because they don’t sound quite right. An essay that could take someone 3 hours takes me triple that.

It’s the same at my job, if a customer interaction doesn’t go as well as I wanted it to it’s in the back of my head for days after. 

My whole life is dictated by this need. I don’t know how to let go of it, I want to be at peace."	nettiwise	post	16.04305230887652	female	White	0.982604444026947	na	na	na	5	stress
"Being a perfectionist doesn’t have to mean you feel like you’re better than everyone.
Sometimes it can mean you’re afraid of not being as good as everyone else.

"By and large, it sounds like an issue with control. Thats usually where perfectionism stems from. Its not so much about believing you are better than anyone, but its usually based in a fear of being unprepared/unable to control situations. Usually due to some type of situation in your past where you felt out of control and weren’t able to learn how to deal with that feeling properly (how we are raised in our childhood is a common source, but it can also be specific instances too). 

Im working through my own control issues currently; unfortunately I’m right at the start of it, so i don’t have a lot of advice. But i wanted to commiserate; both myself snd my sister are referred to as “perfectionists,” and i can empathize with the stress it causes. I have slowly started to release my grip on trying to control stuff that doesn’t need to be controlled (as well as not caring as much about interactions that i might’ve “failed” at), but its taken SO MUCH effort to do so. Its like actively fighting against a compulsion; not easy to do (or tell someone how to do).

"I think gifting back immediately/with the intention of wanting to “repay” someone defeats the purpose of gifting, which is just saying “hey, i thought of you and thought you might like this!” but in physical form. People who give gifts often don’t want anything in return, other than maybe continued friendship; sometimes, not even that. I think thats why big holidays or birthdays with “compulsory” gift giving feel so difficult for a lot of people; its less about the “hey, I saw this and thought of you!” and is more “if i DON’T give them something I am showing I don’t care.” But something randomly gifted is generally done out of kindness and shouldn’t come with strings attached.

Just accept it graciously: thank the neighbor, be friendly whenever you see them, and then move on with your life. If you end up seeing something they might like (or making some type of food that you think they might like to try), then you can always bring your own gift to them later. But you don’t have to stress over “repaying” a gift."	sound5music	reply	na	na	na	0.9987055063247681	no	no	no	na	stress

I grind my teeth and bite my tongue I don’t want to be an utter failure at life. I’m scared of amounting to nothing because I want to do many things, I’ve always had high expectations for myself. I’m tired, I’m scared and I don’t know how to end this cycle and actually do my work. I take to long to sleep and keep waking up, my back always hurts, my neck hurts like crap whenever I see people with good grades because I feel like my grades would be lower and I hate being academically inferior.

"I’ve been scrolling this subreddit looking for ways to deal with stress. I’m a 22 year old college student. This past year I have completely shut myself out from the world (not literally), but mentally.

My mother was incarcerated recently. Her and her husband kicked my 18 year-old brother out (still don’t know why). My dad and I have a rocky relationship. With all of that, I’m a full-time student and looking for another job. With that being said, those events have taken a toll on me mentally. I feel so drained and emotionally overwhelmed. It’s started taking a toll on me physically. I don’t eat that often, have stopped exercise, barely leave the house, and quit my job. I don’t even remember the last time I got a good night rest (sleep without tossing and turning every hour). It’s been months. I feel so terrible. You can just look at me and tell i’m not myself.

What can I do to help manage my stress levels? I’m about to go back to therapy in a few weeks. I don’t know where to start aside from that. Any tips would be extremely helpful."	lenathehelper	post	22.99713255027414	female	White	0.9980802536010742	na	na	na	2	stress

So I’ve been stressed out a lot the past two months almost with school and family bullshit, finals and anything else. So when I get stressed I just don’t get hungry I tend to skip meals, or when I’m really busy I just forget to eat. But now I’m starting to see the effects of it on my health, I can’t afford that much food to begin with so I’m used to skipping meals, but now I have to make myself eat more	Monstercringe	post	12.819276602625301	female	White	0.007848162204027176	na	na	na	1	stress
"I’ve been doing this for years too. It’s just not my priority at all when I’m busy or stressed. I don’t feel hungry and then I just forget. I have a busy job and I skip lunch quite a lot and just snack while working because I don’t have enough time. I sometimes feel guilty taking a proper break when I have so much to do.
Ive probably been like this for the past 15 years. I did used to struggle to afford enough food for a good few years too. Even now that I live a bit more comfortably, I’m still very cautious of cost. It’s so stupid but sometimes I’d I don’t have food to hand for a meal then I will still skip or only buy something small because it seems like a waste of money. I’m totally aware I do this and it’s so unhealthy but I still do it! I’m not sure what it wrong with me. I’ve never told anyone this before. 
I am trying really hard at the moment to eat and be healthier due to fertility issues - that no doubt this has contributed to. 
One thing I have found that really helps me is to plan and make affordable meals that I like and take them to work, as that’s where I skip most meals. If I know I’ve got something good with me then I’ll eat it - even if it’s a super quick break. If I have to go out to buy something for lunch I know I’ll make excuses and avoid it. 
I try and have food I really like ready to have/make for breakfast so that I definitely eat that too before I leave the house.

"Last month I had to make a hard decision: Quit my job to save my mental health, or stay there and eventually suffer a burnout that’ll cause me to lash out at everyone for everything.  I chose to quit because I just knew I wouldn’t go long without a job.

New year, new hiring season, but I’m still here…in my room…applying for jobs…almost 50-100 applications sent a week, but because I’m not specialized in anything, I have to wait for handouts.

When I eat my stomach hurts, but when I dont eat my stomach hurts and I feel close to fainting. I can’t sleep, I’ve been staying up til like 1-2am just…applying. I literally have nothing better to do. No money to spend so I can’t go anywhere. Me and my mom need to go grocery shopping, but both of us are too broke to do so, but we make too much for food stamps and I was denied unemployment.

I tried to smoke the stress away, but that only caused me to feel like I need it so I don’t lose my mind being a manic freak.

"Your stress is certainly affecting your health badly. It's a tough situation to be in.

 But it's ok. Because this is just a temporary phase in your life. So for the time being, I advise you: have NO EXPECTATIONS whatsoever. This is a great way to reduce some of your stress.
 See... We humans have a tendency to expect certain outcomes - "" I just knew I wouldn’t go long without a job."" ""tried to smoke the stress away"". When these expectations aren't met, we become frustrated. Then more stress. 
But the wise thing to do is to not have expectations, because in reality, life is very unpredictable. There are too many external factors that can affect outcomes. So it is wiser to OBSERVE what will happen, rather than expect a certain outcome. So instead of expecting you'll get hired in no time, just keep applying (and do the other things I'll suggest to you down below). Eventually, you'll get employed. But by not fixing any time frame, you'll significantly lower your chances of feeling bad. That's important for your health.
I will say though that it was a right decision to leave that stressful job. Burnout is never worth it. It is never worth compromising your health, be it physical or emotional, just for a job and income. You can make do with a lower income and the resultant low standard of living, but if you stay in a job that increases your stress, (stress causes debilitating diseases) then you have higher cost of living due to doctor/hospital visits and diagnostic tests, treatments. You know how expensive that is? 
So it's better to be stress free, healthy and compromise with a lower standard of living.
This is the truth of life.

You're not specialized in anything...
I'll suggest you do the following:

- apply for internships/part time work, so that at least you'll get your foot in the door of some company. Your performance, if it impresses your employers, you can get a full time job after internship/part time is over.
Same applies to volunteering somewhere. Volunteer at some company. For free. Judge the atmosphere there. If you think they might hire you seeing your performance, plus if you think they might have shortage of staff, this is your opportunity to impress them and show dedication/commitment at work. Again, you might get full time job after some time .
Even if you don't get hired after all this, you know what you'll GAIN? Experience and skills and knowledge. Chance to develop competencies. This work experience, be it from volunteering/part time/internship can be highlighted in your resume, which will increase your employability and chances to get hired. This is how you develop specialization in something. 
- use this opportunity , free time, to complete free courses online that will certify you in knowledge/skills that will increase your employability. There's countless options available. On YouTube, there's a whole variety of videos on literally ANY subject you wish to learn. Educate yourself in this free time. So that you can exhibit your acquired subject knowledge to future employers, giving you an edge.
- never smoke. studies among cigarette smokers have found that young people who smoke have higher levels of perceived stress and anxiety. This is scientific research. This stress will add to your stomach pain. I don't want you ruining your good health. Please don't use substances and intoxicants to cope with your difficult situation. These hard times will change, but the damage you'll have done through smoking will stay with you, haunting you, causing suffering. You don't want that. Health is our true wealth.
- do eat food. The stomach pain most likely is from 2 causes: 1) stress. 2) not eating when you're hungry. If you have avoided eating despite hunger multiple times in the past, this can cause little wounds in your stomach from the increased acidity. But don't worry. The body heals itself if given a chance. 
The best way for your stomach to heal is to never skip eating if you're hungry. Food is fuel for our brains. If you stay hungry, your brain won't work, so how will you have energy to sustain your life and any potential job? You feel faint because your body is screaming for food (fuel) to run it, but you ain't giving it any. 

- don't obsess over applying. Be patient. No need to stay up late for applying. Again, your sleep deprivation is adding to your problems. Lack of sleep increases stress hormones in one's body and can contribute to your stomach pain, adding to overall feeling of frustration. Get your night's sleep, a full 8 hours+. Your brain will then work efficiently and you'll be in a happier mood when your mind is fully rested.
- you've explored all there is on the internet? Why not explore the outdoors? Go out for walks in your locality. Go places you never been before. Just observe your surroundings. It destresses.
Plus, you might just come across a place where vacancy is available for job...

No debt taking. Western culture (I'm assuming you're from West part of world) encourages debt taking. I advise you this is not wise. Debt adds to existing problems and stress. It doesn't solve problems, even though it seems it would.  Minimise, or even avoid (better), spending on non-essential items. The money you save today, will support you in future. You'll feel so relieved in future, seeing how much you'll have saved.

You know something... Such situations in life often strengthen us. They're there to serve a purpose. Perhaps life wants to teach us something/give us new opportunities through these tough situations. This difficult situation is giving you the opportunity to learn something valuable that'll increase your employability (through courses, volunteering/part time work), practice self care and value your health (by eating on time, sleeping for 8+hrs), exercise, practice patience (an important virtue that'll benefit you in future situations, especially at work), etc.

Good days will come. But before that, use this time wisely as I suggested, you'll be so productive and less stressed. All of this is temporary. That's the beauty of life. These hard times change and don't stay the same forever. So take a deep breath and sigh it all out.

"I would usually try to combat everything in my response, but here I have nothing to say. You’re right. And I appreciate your wisdom. Thank you so much for your suggestions, it cleared my head a bit.

I’m a very patient person, at least I think I am. But all of these factors causes me to just…lose it sometimes.  It doesn’t help when your mom lives the same lifestyle, of stressing over work, smoking the pain away, and spending what little free time she has sleeping or watching tv. As much as I love my mom, I see the damage it causes to her and I don’t want that for myself, but it’s so hard in times like these to be stronger than fear. 

So many people go homeless overnight due to corruption, personal downfalls, or freaks of nature it’s insane. My mom, despite working 12 hours a day at a job she hates, is a single short paycheck away from having everything we have crumble. If she quit her job, we’d be homeless. 

I have a passion for helping people, but when I see so many stories around me and on the internet, of people that despite all the hard work they put in the past or present, their future was ripped away from them due to factors they can’t control. And they’re forced to be ok with it. It’s scary, and this is the biggest reason why I’m stressed.

My bad for talking about myself and my life, I self-reflect best through text. But I want you to know that I hear you. I think I’m going to go for a drive tonight. I wish the best for you and your family ❤️ And I hope 2023 treats you better than it’s been treating me so far."	Zeione29047	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9980027079582214	weak	strong	no	na	stress
"Parents are just humans. Imperfect. Many times they repeat the patterns subconsciously learnt from _their_ parents. It's painful to deal with such parents when we ourselves need someone's support to cope with hardships. But it is what it is. 

You're a good person for loving your mom (no matter how imperfect, family is family 🙂, it's all you've got), being patient and having that human quality of being helpful.

No matter how bad the influence is from your mom's side, remember that her lifestyle is damaging. You are wise in recognising that such a lifestyle is harmful and you certainly DO NOT want to replicate that. Try your best not to. You have live example in front of your eyes (your mom) of how destructive smoking and stress can be for you. You may not be able to change her, but you have the power to save yourself and have a healthy beautiful life for many years to come. 

Fear and love are two sides of the same coin. One negative, other Positive. If fear turns you towards destructive tendencies, grow love within and know that it's stronger than fear. Love for yourself, for your good health that'll ensure a great life ahead for you. For those you passionately help out. For your family. That random animal out in the street. For _anyone_ you deem worthy. This love will give you hope to redeem yourself, to care for yourself, to do what's best for you.

Do one thing.... Read your comment just above this one. Do you see a pattern? 
""So many people go homeless overnight due to corruption, personal downfalls, or freaks of nature"" ""If she quit her job, we’d be homeless."" ""I see so many stories around me and on the internet... their future was ripped away""
Unfortunately, (I can understand why, i.e. your life situation is unstable and unpredictable, you feel insecure) you've developed a highly negative Outlook towards life and therefore you tend to notice all the bad things instantly. They overpower your mind and increase your stress. you'll admit one thing though? 1) If many people are going homeless due to various reasons, there are countless others who have a secure home or some place to stay and they're ok. 2) your mom _may_ quit her job.... Or she may not. And you'll have a steady income to survive on all the way till you start earning. This can happen too. No? And even if she quits, she might find another job. So you won't be homeless. 3) people have had their lives destroyed, but others are in a much better place. So why not see this side of society?

Again, your mind may have developed a tendency to see the harsh, brutal, horrible side of the world. But if you see and expose yourself MORE to the blessed, stable secure, positive side of the world, your stress will diminish. Truly. 
Psychology says that what we expose ourselves to is what becomes our life. The more tragic news and stories you read/watch, the more you'll feel stressed. The read/watch the opposite, and avoid the negative, you'll feel happier and safer. Both good and bad exist side by side around us. But instead of letting the bad affect us psychologically, let's not judge anything and simply OBSERVE what happens in reality, to us. Just because xyz things happen to others, doesn't mean they'll happen to us. 

To reduce your stress and fear, please avoid reading and watching violent, negative emotions inducing news/stories/media content/drama shows. You don't need this negative influence in your life. Your own life situation is enough for you to deal with. Watch uplifting, inspiring, motivational content if you want to watch something.

Allow your positive human traits to flourish and grow. They'll take you far. Your helpful and loving nature, patience, wise-ness. Develop these. It doesn't matter what the result of your good-intentioned actions is, you keep doing them. forget what you can't control (the result of those actions). Focus on what you CAN control, that is your proactive actions to help, care and love ( self and others).

There are multiple YouTube channels that include GUIDED SLEEP MEDITATIONS. Especially those meditations catered to children you MUST listen to! They're extremely soothing and comforting. they're very effective to mitigate anxiety / depression / worrying / ruminating over intrusive thoughts, basically any negative state of mind, the MORE you listen to them. They contain positive uplifting empowering content that promotes positivity within you and strengthens you mentally.

This content will effectively replace the negative emotions/mindset you're experiencing, transform it into positivity and promote good quality sleep, so you can have a pleasant mood throughout the day. 😊

Make them a regular part of your life and see the miraculous difference they make. Some amazing channels you can check out: Soothing Pod - Sleep Meditation and Bedtime Stories, Relax For A While, Down to Sleep, Happy Minds - Sleep Meditation and Bedtime Stories, Jason Stephenson - Sleep Meditation Music (includes great meditations), Michelle's Sanctuary: Sleep Stories and Meditations. (Note: avoid listening to negative emotions inducing stories, like those from crime/horror/mystery/suspense genre. They will only worsen your situation.)

These guided meditations, if you listen to them in bed while sleeping every day, will be akin to a consistent daily meditation practice.

(Meditation produces a deep state of relaxation that'll stay with you even when you're not meditating because it causes physical brain changes, calms your mind, releases ""happy"" hormones and neurotransmitters, and decreases stress hormones. If done consistently for years.)"	Zeione29047	reply	na	na	na	0.9980027079582214	weak	strong	no	na	stress
"I hope this would reach someone to make them feel less lonely. 
I am studying constantly to finish my bachelors degree by time, and when I say constantly I mean from 12am to 12pm, with 10 mins of break every hour, and with the breaks needed to eat. Then I start to follow my interests by watching videos on yt, and I end sleeping every night at 4/5am (that’s why I start studying that late in the morning). In the meanwhile, my mom’s getting old and dad is emotionally far (they divorced). My mom is almost every day stressed and sad (for reasons that can be acceptable and sometimes unacceptable), and I don’t know how to talk with my dad, because I don’t feel him as a “real” father, due to some things that happened in the past but which I can’t actually forget. 
At the same time, my gf is pretty stressed with her life since October 22, and despite the fact that things are still fine, I feel the stress that is infiltrating in our relationship; my best friend are day by day more emotionally far than ever, and I genuinely don’t know what to do.

You can't improve things if the other person is not interested in improving the relationship too.

"I’m dealing with a really bad gut situation . Im only 29 but over the summer I was on a 2 month long holiday eating crap and that’s when my stomach problems started. I had blood on my stool at the end of two months and instead of treating it as a hemmoroid because of crap food I’ve been thinking I have colon cancer. Cut to the next 6 months of constant stress and anxiety and nausea and gut issues. I’ve never got constipated in my life before so I’m stressed about colon cancer and this is making me feel even more worried. 

I’ve been to the doctor and he told me the blood may be due to some minor rectal irritation but nothing to worry about. He didn’t check me physically though. 

All my blood tests and stomach ultrasound is clear but I can’t get over the thought of having colon cancer as whenever I’m constipated there’s been blood. 

I’m an extreme hypochondriac and im going through one of the most stressful times of my life and im worried I have colon cancer twenty four seven. Im constantly naseous and I have cramps. My stomach hasn’t been the same in 7 months and I never had this problem earlier. 

Current symptoms : stomach cramps, inability to empty stomach, blood on toilet paper, swollen anus( I can feel a swelling in the area), lots of acid reflux, constantly , and constipated 

Current Mental State// Life Problems: My dad’s company shut down over night 5 Years ago- both my parents  literally have  0 money and we come from quite a upper class background from back in the day. They have no idea how to move forward in the future, I’ve had back to back 4 traumatic relationships where I feel like I’ve only been dumped because of the troubles my dad is facing and no one wants to be a part of this kind of a family. I’ve had men enter my lives, totally support me and fly away with all my trust broken back to back and all of this has broken me. I also saw my best friend pass away in a freak fire accident 3 years ago. All my friends are married / getting married and I feel constantly alone and sad. I can’t cope 
I run my own company and I’m independent enough to live my life currently - but there’s no security for the future and I’m just constantly feeling like I’m racing with time to make ends meet. I feel like no one understands the place I am in physically and mentally and my physical health is making me unable to work mentally - and if I don’t work I won’t be able to sustain myself. 

I used to be a go getter- constantly at the gym and now I struggle to get out of bed. I have no answers on what’s happening to me .

The last time I saw fresh blood was in JULY and now again In December. It’s fresh and very little but enough to make my mind spiral and think I’m dying/ I can’t switch off my brain and I’m constantly burning - farting and have reflux too! 

Do you think stress / anxiety are making my symptoms worse? I love to drink and I can’t even touch a drink thinking my stomach will spasm and bleed which makes me even more nervous and anxious. I’m at a loss of words and I can’t live a normal life. I want to switch off from the thought that I have a serious disease.

"Oh man, you have no clue how much just hearing the first line of saying you kind of relate helps ! Just being alone and having no one understand what you may be going through is stress enough. 

I’ve been to 3 doctors who’ve told me it’s not cancer and I don’t have to worry including the top gastro of the country! 

I thought that would ease me but my symptoms aren’t decreasing! I’m in a constant state of panic and worry and it’s strongly hindering my being. I can’t believe all the symptoms  are in my head and my worry maybe causing this. 

God! Thanks for replying anyway . Happy to know you have found solace in your partner. I think it helps when your partner has known you long enough and knows your family struggles are nothing to do with you as well as knowing the before struggle you and after struggle you. 

Feel like I have to explain myself to half the men I’m meeting that I’m not a gold digger and what my family went through was genuinely something unusual and one of a kind. I belong to one of the top social circles of the country where everyone is well offf - so that embarrassment and pressure dosent help. I wish I had someone who knew me and my family early and knew us for our genuineness rather than the current situation I’m dealing with . I feel like all of these worries are alone enough to cause me physical damage and to add to it the financial burden.

"I'm so sorry. This sounds like such a very challenging period of your life. 

 I have a few questions for you to answer here or privately.

1. What can you do about the issue? What's within your control?
2. What have you tried and not tried? I assume you've tried many things but not everything.
3. What is not under your control if anything? What must you accept, even if this is very hard to come to terms with?
4. Who can you ask for help? Have you gotten a second opinion? Do you have friends to talk to? Psychologist? Nutritionist? Health coach?
5. Are you currently working on basic physical and mental health practices such as a regular exercise, a healthy diet, getting in touch with nature, journaling, meditation, time with pets, etc.?

I was going through the same thing and had really bad health anxiety a couple of months ago. For example I would randomly feel like I was going to die of a heart attack, have a a seizure, or just have anxiety about a different thing every day. I realized a pattern in my life and I was not like this before, I realized that this only happens when I’m going through something stressful in my life. So for me it was work, I was really stressed at work which caused me to go through this. I think you need to find the cause of your stress and see if that’s the issue because health anxiety is really draining and can prevent you from living your life. If there is something stressful in your life I advise you to find a way to get rid of it. And when I would go through my panic attack episodes of some random disease I thought I had I would say to myself “ you’re not real” because I would never feel any actual symptoms I would convince my brain I did.

"Please remember that you are a human being too who ALSO deserves compassion. As someone who has had depression in the past, it can be a very selfish disorder. Im not saying in terms of “depressed people need to pull themselves up and figure their own shit out and never ask for help.” Obviously not the answer here, as she is probably unable to do that even if she tried. What I’m saying is that she is not in a state where she can GIVE what she needs to in this relationship; she can only really take from the relationship. And that type of relationship really wears people down and causes a lot of issues for everyone involved. Unfortunately, the consequence is often a loss of friendships/relationships. It sucks, but the support system of depressed people HAVE to keep some kind of boundaries to maintain their own health, and oftentimes those boundaries get crossed. You deserve to maintain boundaries for your own health. 

You are NOT her medicine; you are NOT her therapist. Its hard to see people we love hurting and of course we want to help them. But a relationship where only one person is able to give support while the other is only able to take the support is destined to be unstable and end up with lots of problems. Its not balanced if one person is being treated like a therapist rather than as a life partner. 

Im really sorry that you are going through this. Its unfair to you and I know that it hurts. Please realize that you being her support at the expense of your own mental health is going to hurt both of you. She needs professional help and it may be necessary for her to step away from being in a relationship so that she can learn to properly process her depressive states. Your support, as well intentioned as it is, may actually be hindering that process due to you not being able to be a partner to her instead of a therapist. Its a sucky situation."

"I've been trying to move out for years but I make jack shit for my job. 

Every. Single. Day. When I get home there's an issue. It is always my older sister 100%. Whether it's getting back together with her ex that she got a restraining order against, victimizing herself over her kids existences because one of them is crying, or just being drunk, she is always throwing fits and making a scene, ruining everyone's day, for no reason. Let alone assault you for no reason. May God forgive your ignorant soul for thinking you can be in the same building as her when she feels like throwing a temper tantrum like a 4 year old. 

I've talked to our mom numerous times about her. She defends her every single time, sometimes I'll tell her she needs to stop enabling her and she just responds by enabling her. 

They're always telling me to pack my shit and go. Believe me, I'd fucking love to. But even though I pay rent you know they're always holding it over my head what a parasite I am and I'd be dead/homeless without them."

"If you can't change your surroundings, don't. Simple. 

A few ways to lower your current stress levels:

- don't talk to any adult, unless you must (for example, to tell them you're going out, etc). Which means no more talking to your mum about sister.
- save money for moving out later. No debt taking. Western culture (I'm assuming you're from West part of world) encourages debt taking. I advise you this is not wise. Debt adds to existing problems and stress. It doesn't solve problems, even though it seems it would.
So save money. Minimise, or even avoid (better), spending on non-essential items. The money you save today, will support you in future. You'll feel so relieved in future, seeing how much you'll have saved. 
- from what you write, your sister doesn't seem like a mentally healthy/mature mother. Therefore, I encourage you to spend time with your nephews/nieces. I don't know how your existing relationship with them is. But I'd advise you not to let your relationship with your sister or her behaviour discourage you from having a positive loving relationship with your nephews/ nieces. They're innocent vulnerable children, growing up in an unstable dysfunctional household. They're not getting the love, attention and care they deserve. They're your family. Family is everything.
If you spend loving moments with them, perhaps take them out for walks/park/garden, read stories to them, talk to them about their favourite cartoons, etc. you'll feel better, they'll feel loved and belonged, your relationship with them will strengthen, you'll find these activities/moments destressing (promise 😊), time at home will become bearable for you, and both of you will have someone to call ""family"". You'll see how important this is many years later, in case you can't see it now.
Some family members aren't worth your time and energy. Some of them are. Only you know who they are. So invest your time and energy in those worthy ones, even if they're perhaps distant relatives (in addition to the little ones).  
- spend most of your time outside. If you have internet access, use this opportunity outdoors to do free courses online that will certify you in knowledge/skills that will increase your employability.
- work out. Exercise. This is proven to lower stress. You'll become physically fit too.

You know something... Such situations in life often strengthen us. They're there to serve a purpose. Perhaps life wants to teach us something/give us new opportunities through these tough situations. This difficult situation at home is giving you the opportunity to improve your relationship with the little ones at home, spread joy and love with them, learn something valuable that'll increase your employability (through courses), exercise, practice patience (an important virtue that'll benefit you in future situations, especially at work), etc.

Good days will come. But before that, use this time wisely as I suggested, you'll be so productive and less stressed. All of this is temporary. That's the beauty of life. These hard times change and don't stay the same forever. So take a deep breath and sigh it all out.

I want the best for you. So suggested all these things that may help you manage life better.

In the meantime, try not to stay home as long as possible. So spend more time at the local library, in a park or garden.

I live down south in a mountainous/hilly area and i find it stressing even as a passenger at times because of how winding and narrow the roads are. it's as if a normal street was cut in half. there is consistently a large amount of brush around these roads which can obscure my vision. there are also a lot of guard rails around these roads which adds to it. i am being pressured by my family to learn to drive, mainly because 10 years ago my mom got high on prescription pills as she often does and went out at 3 in the morning driving somewhere and critically injured herself, almost paralyzing herself in the process (i was told that my mother is in the .1% of people who have a full complete recovery from the type of spinal damage she incurred in her accident without any loss of mobility). i also take prescription medication, and she has begun threatening to not pick up my prescriptions anymore if i don't do this which has also added to my stress. my family tells me that i can do all sorts of fun activities outside if i have a car (which i have little to no interest in, the only reason i leave my house is for food shopping and doctor's appointments). i obviously do not live somewhere there is easily accessible public transportation, either. for the most part i'm scared of injuring myself or another person if i'm behind the wheel.	sound5music	post	28.304314278920188	female	White	0.9983237385749817	na	na	na	3	stress

I just recently got a decent job pretty much handed to me so I decided to take the opportunity but the anxiety from it is insane. Its not even really job related, its really just me being suuper insecure and shy and worrying about what they'll think of me.

"It won't kill you. But it's important to analyse why you feel insecure, shy and worry. Those results of  (small) traumas.

What happend in the past that caused these?

You can learn and develop yourself how not to be insecure, shy or worry.

For example if you're insecure about your results/production ask feedback where you can improve. If they tell you, you're doing a great job and don't need improvement: Accept that!

I don't know where your shyness comes from, but practicing social situations helps overcome it. Ask for help from a therapist. 

To stop with worrying is hard when you keep on fantasizing negatively. Either we do something about a problem or we don't because it's not actually our problem to worry about. Knowing what to do about a problem is something you can learn and develop knowledge and skills for.

See if your work would be willing to accommodate something like that. If you are able to stick it out and work though it you’ll definitely end up stronger and more resilient in the future but there’s also no shame in quitting because it isn’t for you, you know what’s best for you.

These last couple years have been extremely stressful for me and I am now 30 y/o and in 2 years, I went from 1-2 grey hairs in my beard to like 50. It is wild.	Confident_Notice975	post	41.10128625772148	male	White	0.9934605360031128	na	na	na	3	stress
"It truly is. Stress can cause not just grey hair, but many horrendous diseases, even go as far as landing you up in hospital. I would tell you this... Living a stress free life should be your topmost priority. Far more important than ANYTHING else. Stress induced diseases cost money, precious time, the suffering you have to endure, the waste of energy, not worth it. 
What is it that is causing you stress? Please try your best to mitigate these things.. Get rid of those stressors that you can. Even if it means cutting off ties with toxic people in your life or even leaving a stressful job. None of these stressors are worth it. Trust me

Incorporate mindfulness practices in your routine daily. Breathing exercises that combat the stress effect on your body. 
Deep diaphragmatic breathing. Learn this. 
Get lots of sleep.
Do read ancient philosophies that teach us how to correctly live our lives, so that we prioritise only that which is TRULY worth prioritising and going after, while letting go of that which isn't worth our efforts, time, etc. Often, we run after things that are useless, but we think they're worth going after due to the influence of society/media on us. And running after these things causes the massive stress that is unnecessary. Philosophies teach us the best way to live, the healthiest way to live. There is a great YouTube channel that teaches such philosophies, totally worth subscribing to. Watch the videos, slowly, take your time. Actively Implement the philosophy you feel is right for you. Could be more than one. Channel's called: einzelgänger.

I also recommend you join Mindfulness, Meditation, Simple Living, Minimalism, Self Improvement subs on Reddit. You'll find people there  who you can learn alot of good things from. Be inspired to live like the communities in these subs, plus incorporate meditation and other such practices you'll come across there."

4 top stressors in any relationship are sex, parenting, in-laws and money.  It’s okay!  You aren’t alone, there are many of us out here hustling and stressing with you.  That’s important to really think about.  It’s not just you, you are not an abnormal anomaly.  With that said, try some [focused attention meditation](https://www.iqmindware.com/focused-attention-meditation/), I promise you it works!  Try to find a physical outlet, it doesn’t have to be extreme, a simple walk will help.  Eating and sleeping are dire important to mental health, I mean dire.  Get on a regular sleep schedule, 7-8 hours every night.  Cut out the screen time before bed and in general as it can alter your mood.  Eat healthy smaller meals more often with good carbs, plenty of protein and vegetables.  Try getting outside in nature for at least 30 minutes a day.  Listen to the world, birds chirping and the wind, it offers a connection to something bigger than you.  For me, nature is a stable reminder that no matter what I’m going thru that the world still turns.  A new day is right around the corner, and a new chance to make improvements.

"The past 3 years have been extremely stressful for me. I’ve dealt with my best friend passing away, my family going broke and two back to back boyfriends dumping me.  

I’m dealing with a really bad gut situation .’m only 29 but over the summer I was on a 2 month long holiday eating crap and that’s when my stomach problems started. I had blood on my stool at the end of two months and instead of treating it as a hemmoroid because of crap food I’ve been thinking I have colon cancer. Cut to the next 6 months of constant stress and anxiety and nausea and gut issues. I’ve never got constipated in my life before so I’m stressed about colon cancer and this is making me feel even more worried. 

I’ve been to the doctor and he told me the blood may be due to some minor rectal irritation but nothing to worry about. He didn’t check me physically though. 

All my blood tests and stomach ultrasound is clear but I can’t get over the thought of having colon cancer as whenever I’m constipated there’s been blood. 

I’m an extreme hypochondriac and im going through one of the most stressful times of my life and im worried I have colon cancer twenty four seven. Im constantly naseous and I have cramps. My stomach hasn’t been the same in 7 months and I never had this problem earlier. 

Current symptoms : stomach cramps, inability to empty stomach, blood on toilet paper, swollen anus( I can feel a swelling in the area), lots of acid reflux, constantly , and constipated 

The last time I saw fresh blood was in JULY and now again In December. It’s fresh and very little but enough to make my mind spiral and think I’m dying/ I can’t switch off my brain and I’m constantly burning - farting and have reflux too! 

I’m currently dealing with a situation where my parents are broke, my boyfriend dumped me 8 months ago and our family is dealing with severe financial troubles. 

Do you think stress / anxiety are making my symptoms worse? I love to drink and I can’t even touch a drink thinking my stomach will spasm and bleed which makes me even more nervous and anxious. I’m at a loss of words and I can’t live a normal life. I want to switch off from the thought that I have a serious disease.

Sounds like you did everything you can / should do in order to confirm you don’t have colon cancer, i know its hard but trust in that. Probably the most impactful thing you can do (based on your responses and my own personally experience) is to be religious about exercise. Aim for 3 times a week, track it and see how it impacts your stress levels. Maybe even journal so that you can go back and read your thoughts in prior weeks as real evidence on how exercise has impacted you. I find one issue with keeping up a new routine like that is really believing its yielding the necessary results, right now you seem half convinced when you say “it may have a correlation” but imagine how your commitment to it would change if you said “I know it 100% has a direct impact on reducing my stress” (which by the way, is what I believe). Apart from that, I suggest you find someone to talk to which also will help reduce your anxiety. There are some online portals you can go through to speak to therapists remotely like Talkspace, haven’t tried it personally but heard good things. I’m flicking through this thread because I have been managing a good deal of work stress and have been thinking about it more than usual lately. Personally I have noticed that stress in itself has been the biggest drivers of my problems, from lack of sleep to a mental roadblock that prevents me from actually doing the activities that would mitigate my stress. For me, I have realized the stress itself is worse than what I am stressing about and when I reframe it that way and focus on attacking / mitigating my stress levels it has made a big difference. Oh one last thing, I read this book called “the obstacle is the way” and it helped me reframe how I think about the difficult times in life to see how they can create opportunity.

"How many jobs have you had so far? Have they all been administrative? 

I typically have to give most jobs at least 3 months to see if i truly like or dislike them. 2 weeks is usually not enough time for me to determine how well I’m gonna do (unless i have a problem with the actual work culture). First month is brutal because its a steep learning curve, second month sucks because you know *just enough* to know that you made a mistake/are still going slow but stent yet sure how to avoid the mistake/be more efficient, third month is generally where you start to get into a groove.

What about the work do you dislike? Are you in a desk all day and antsy from not moving much? Are you staring at a screen, dealing with a ton of emails/phone calls/meetings? Are the tasks themselves super detail-oriented and frustrating? Is it difficult to find answers to how to actually do the tasks without feeling like you are bothering someone unnecessarily (this one is always something i have issues with)? 

There are so many variables and I’m sure that at least some of them can be modified to help alleviate some stress, while other stuff you may just have to keep chugging through until you know how to do stuff more efficiently (that learning curve is NORMAL; its okay that you don’t know how to do everything super efficiently right at the start). There are a few things that might not be changeable, such as work culture, shitty management, or just overall disliking whatever end goal you are working towards. in that case, perhaps a different team or even a different field would be better for you.

"see if you can break down your job into simple, easy to execute tasks and group them into clusters of 3-5. finish a cluster and give yourself a rewards break! building in time to acknowledge the god with you are doing is critical.
for stuff you can’t get done, figure out how to either elevate to your boss so they can help remove blockers or find other resources who have the answers.
also go find some work allies and friends - people who you vibe well with and use them to share frustrations and figure out how to really get stuff done.
do this for several months and take stock in your situation. instead of despairing day to day, plan out stretches of 3-5 weeks where you’re going to stay head down and work it out no matter what without self-blame.
lastly, look into the concept of how to be a “happy warrior”. essentially acknowledge that works sucks and is full of challenges but that you explicitly decide to attack those challenges with a happy disposition, ignore the haters and the crap and stay focused on moving the ball forward.

I have no real advice to offer, but I want to say you’re not alone. I have a passion, but it’s something that’s easy to take advantage of and dehumanizing. It’s really hard to tell the difference between the job being shitty and your mental state being shitty. And the worst part is one can affect the other, and before you know it, you lose one trying to maintain the other.

I quit my job a month ago because I worked for some incompetent POS. It was time to go when the CEO made it seem like I was in the office unauthorized when we had things to do that day, and she turned around and lied to my boss saying I was doing one thing when I wasn’t.

Have an internal dialogue and write down everything you feel and your feelings about every individual person and individual task you do. Write out all the “what ifs” of each situation. For example: “if I do this and not that within my task, what are the possible outcomes/consequences?”. Or “if I treat a person this way versus that way, what is the most likely response I will get from that person?” Journaling and writing down and having these internal dialogues in simple attainable ways by just jotting down quickly what’s on your mind will have a tremendous change on your outlook on life as a whole and your mental health. Remember, by doing this, you are essentially being the best person for yourself and for others. Sometimes you can’t control how a person or your environment responds, but you can prepare as best as you can and control what’s in your mind.	bobbyekare	reply	na	na	na	0.9994738698005676	no	no	no	na	stress

"I feel ya. 

Perhaps you may not like office jobs? If they all make you feel this way, there may be some aspect of office work/environment that you dislike.

I personally can’t stand office jobs; they make me feel like I’m dying inside. I gravitate towards jobs where I’m walking around a lot: laboratory work, warehouses, restaurants, etc. There are fields where you don’t have to be stuck at a desk all day and can still get promoted pretty far. There are contract jobs that make a buttload; you just have to build up a network of clients, but the payoff is great. 

You are at an age where you can try different things. If you are finding office work miserable, you can always try something completely different and see what you like and dislike.

"Others gave you good advice. Especially the meditation and exercise part. 

I'll recommend you focus on resolving anaemia. Yes, stress can cause what you're going through physically, including the absent periods and lack of sleep. But there's one more thing I think is important in your case. Have you done blood test for vitamin D and B12? These nutrients, if you're deficient in them, can cause anxiety, depression, overthinking, inability to cope with stress, negative thinking. Particularly in the case of b12, its deficiency can cause anaemia. So I suggest you conduct these blood tests. If deficient, normalise the levels under the care of a doctor. You'll see an improvement in majority of your symptoms (if this applies to you). 

And yes. Ignore all those things that aren't under your control. Like other's opinions of you. The more you do this, the less stressors you'll have."	Boojo45	reply	na	na	na	0.9971760511398315	weak	no	no	na	stress

"Generally speaking it is difficult to diagnose stress amd most of the times it is diagnosed by elimination of everything else. I assume this person has done the necessary check ups and he was found to be physically healthy. 
I have not experienced what you described but i have been through a lot due to stress. What I did use to struggle with a lot during a very difficult period was shortness of breath. I felt like my lung capacity was 50%. It's really amazing what stress can do to our bodies.
So what helped me a lot personally was figuring out what made me feel safe and did that. It could be certain people certain places or environments type of music specific movies or books. I tried to avoid the things that made me feel uneasy for a while and focused on all the good things in my life. I moved out of my parents' house eventually and started to feel much better too. Talking to a therapist helps massively. This would really be the best advice I could give you. Try to find the right therapist for you and things should soon start to improve.
Exercise and diet seem to play a big role on the overall way that we feel about ourselves and our motivation levels.
Some natural supplements also help with stress but you could do a little research on your own about that or talk to a naturopath about it.

I'm on the upside of what your friend is going through. I'd say I was around the same age as him when I'd wake up with a queasy stomach. When I was in grade school, I had to wake up around 6:00 a.m, when I was in college and my 9-5 job, I'd wake up around 8:00 a.m. I wouldn't be able to eat/my queasiness wouldn't go away until sometime between 9:00 a.m - 11:00 a.m, but since I was in class or at work, I wouldn't be able to eat anything until I had my lunch. I couldn't even drink water. However, when I had a day off and I was able to sleep in until 9:00 am or so, I never felt queasy. What helped me was taking Omeprazole. I think I was supposed to take it in the morning when I woke up, but I ended up taking it at night when I took my other meds. I'm also starting a new job where I work from 2:00 p.m - 10:00 p.m, so I'm able to sleep in and not feel sick in the morning. I would definitely recommend your friend talk to a doctor or a therapist about anxiety and potentially investigate if there is anything such as GERD.	miesnoetic	reply	na	na	na	0.9981638789176941	weak	strong	no	na	stress
I agree - I got a dog and my symptoms nearly completely went away, but I also haven't had them as long. My doctor advised me to take glycine to try to help too. I've also tried to change my schedule to be able to sleep in as much as possible because that is the most consistent thing that has helped me. Changing jobs to change your sleep schedule is 100% worth removing these symptoms.

Only meds I've tried is low grade anxiety meds. And I'm unsure what bloods. My doc ran more thursday, said he'd call if anything was different. They tested for that one thing that starts with a T that checks for damage in the heart or recent HA's. 
And during the echocardiogram my Hr was 130. She noted it was fast but then 2 weeks later I get a call. Holter didn't show anything super concerning and the echo was fine. I am under tons of anxiety and stress but whatever is going on has had me bed ridden with neck pain, dizziness, headaches and heart discomfort . The fast HR and pounding feeling for literally months essentially with no breaks. My entire life has been Halted because I can't do anything. I take a shower and my heart goes a million miles an hour and my blood pressure goes to the 140's over 90. Brain fog and dizziness. Tinnitus like crazy and this weird whooshing sound and pain from my neck .
It all started with going to the doctor bc I had Thunderclap headaches after orgasm, which lasted everytime for 2 weeks then just stopped. Then I started feeling worse and that stopped but all this started. I've had an echocardiogram, several EKGs from the ER visits, an MRI 3 months ago no contrast, a CT with contrast of my chest and neck last month, a CT with contrast of my head last week. Noone can find anything. Only suggestion my doc had Thursday was potentially ICP and he looked worri3d that's what it was and said if I get a headache go to the er. Which I did 2 days ago to which they didn't do bloodwork but they did a CT and Xray . Tested my eye movement . Then gave me a shot and sent me home. 
I obviously need to continue to see my doctor and will. Just 4 months of this I'm trying to reach out for things to recommend to my doctor to test for and try because they're struggling hard. The only things I can even think of personally anymore is craniocervical instability, anxiety, and maybe clogged artery issues. With the ICP he thought, which is phesable I have 95 percent of the symptoms but the numerous head CTs and the MRI showing no pressure(doesn't rule it out) and the fact that it's been 4 months since it all began and I've not stroked out or anything makes it seem not entirely sure for me personally.

There was one about music and hearing the situation of a loved one, depend g on the music it would make me feel more stressed, but there was no option for that.

"I would try an elimination diet avoiding any inflammatory foods. This would include processed seed oils, most vegetables, legumes, or dairy if you’re intolerant.

Also avoiding heavily or otherwise unnaturally processed food, especially those high in sugars.

Guess who the only source of income is.

You must be in the US? Are you unionized? I'm a janitor at an elementary school in canada. I make 29$/hr. It's union, benefits, pension, 20 sick days/year, 5 weeks paid vacation, and I do at most about 3 hours of hard work a day. I feel for you, keeping an area clean and nice for the public is an important job its honestly society through Hollywood that makes every janitor out to be a serial killer lol. The job fits me, I'm not anti social, just an introvert. When i started I worked 10 years on night shift. No one in the building just listen to music or podcasts and get my work done. But my wife got tired of never seeing me so I took a dayshift. I thought it would be terrible being around the staff and students all day but it's really not so bad. My wife's a dental hygienist and makes $56/hr. We own our own home. But we're still feeling the effects of inflation and the current economy. Every month i have less $ in my bank than the previous month. And i have friends in the trades who make way more money than me and they are in the same boat. Everybodys hurting right now. Its cause most people were told they werent essential so stay home for a year and we'll just print trillions of dollars to pay you to not work. We're feeling it now for sure. Anyway, that's my story. If you're good at your job, start your own company. I work with guys who get contracts to clean auto dealerships, offices etc after hours and they can charge up to $50/hr. Do you strip and refinish floors at the hospital? That's actually a skill. Go into a business and if they have dirty wax tile floors offer them to strip and refinish it for them. I don't know, do you have any other training? Maybe just get out of your line of work altogether? What's your rent cost? What's your grocery bill? I think the cost of living is a little lower in usa than Canada so your 15/ would be more like 22/hr here. Which isn't really terrible. It's not amazing but our minimum wage here is 15/hr and somehow those workers are surviving. But they are living in households that contribute. Yours sounds like it doesn't.

"I'm talking more in a chronic sense. I've had anxiety for about 12 years now. Past 8 months have been the worst in my life, second only to being abused as a kid.

I started having panic attacks that woke me up in the night (for no reason, like this was before the hell time) and then got diagnosed with GERD within the same month. Developed hypochondria. Had to move to a massive uni to get the degree I wanted, but I was sick and exhausted and working and struggled to make friends. So im alone all the time. And there's always something that's wrong. I had low grade good poisoning for weeks because I didn't notice a fridge issue. I got an ear infection. I still have pretty persistent vertigo, though it was getting better until I got a cold during my finals, of all times.

And that's not factoring in the handful of deeply personal shit thats happened that I'm not going to blast all over the internet.

I'm seeing a therapist. I'm not on medication because it scares me, and my psychiatrist agreed that it wasn't for the best, at least right now. 

I've developed fun little heart palpitations. They're terrifying.

I'm wondering if im under such a high level of stress all the time that it's begun to just feel normal. Like I dont know what to do to ""calm down and relieve stress"" because to me, a good day is a day where I avoid a breakdown.

I'd ask my therapist but im on holiday and can't see her until January. I'll probably ask her anyways but still."	lucue_	post	21.068803498721948	male	White	0.9937638640403748	na	na	na	5	stress
"I’ve been functioning with chronic anxiety my whole life. I was raised in a way that such a state was the norm, through modeling as well as through a coping mechanism. Lately it’s been worse. Days will go by where I don’t realize I’ve been shallow breathing on fight or flight mode all day.  

If I get too relaxed or let down my guard just a little I find something new or old to get stressed out about again, because not being anxious feels so weird and abnormal. 

I didn’t realize I had this issue until pretty recently.  All that to say, it’s totally possible to have chronic stress/anxiety and not realize it’s unusual or that there’s a different way to exist. 

I’ve had the heart palpitations. Gave up drinking alcohol and coffee which has helped. Magnesium supplements also have helped with that. Now they are more infrequent and don’t usually send me into the spiraling worry that my death is imminent. 

Meds worked well for me. CBD also helped. I hope you find something that helps for you. I also recommend The Worry Trick by David Carbonell.

That being said, I can't quit, as I make more money than my SO. But some days I wish I could. 

Part of what keeps me from having a kid is I'm on migraine meds and you can't take them while pregnant. The idea of going through at least 9 months with 5-10 migraines a month while also working full time is too daunting.

Hey mama, I feel you. I'm not young like you (turning 30 soon) but I still get looked down on for being a SA HM. I am actually completing a degree but doing it very part time as it's all I can manage whilst looking after my LO full time so it will take me five years to complete. You just have to tune everyone out. I noticed you mention you are getting an education, that's good and it doesn't matter if it takes you a while. And there is nothing wrong with being a SAHM but the education side of things is good in case your circumstances ever changed, no one can predict what might happen.

"Same - look what’s happening to me :5 

The past 3 years have been extremely stressful for me. I’ve dealt with my best friend passing away, my family going broke and two back to back boyfriends dumping me.  

I’m dealing with a really bad gut situation .’m only 29 but over the summer I was on a 2 month long holiday eating crap and that’s when my stomach problems started. I had blood on my stool at the end of two months and instead of treating it as a hemmoroid because of crap food I’ve been thinking I have colon cancer. Cut to the next 6 months of constant stress and anxiety and nausea and gut issues. I’ve never got constipated in my life before so I’m stressed about colon cancer and this is making me feel even more worried. 

I’ve been to the doctor and he told me the blood may be due to some minor rectal irritation but nothing to worry about. He didn’t check me physically though. 

All my blood tests and stomach ultrasound is clear but I can’t get over the thought of having colon cancer as whenever I’m constipated there’s been blood. 

I’m an extreme hypochondriac and im going through one of the most stressful times of my life and im worried I have colon cancer twenty four seven. Im constantly naseous and I have cramps. My stomach hasn’t been the same in 7 months and I never had this problem earlier. 

Current symptoms : stomach cramps, inability to empty stomach, blood on toilet paper, swollen anus( I can feel a swelling in the area), lots of acid reflux, constantly , and constipated 

The last time I saw fresh blood was in JULY and now again In December. It’s fresh and very little but enough to make my mind spiral and think I’m dying/ I can’t switch off my brain and I’m constantly burning - farting and have reflux too! 

I’m currently dealing with a situation where my parents are broke, my boyfriend dumped me 8 months ago and our family is dealing with severe financial troubles. 

Do you think stress / anxiety are making my symptoms worse? I love to drink and I can’t even touch a drink thinking my stomach will spasm and bleed which makes me even more nervous and anxious. I’m at a loss of words and I can’t live a normal life. I want to switch off from the thought that I have a serious disease.

"The stress is most assuredly not helping your situation, and when you get older in life stress begins to affect you in extreme physical ways. 

In my case it causes me extreme heartburn

First of all, you don't have colon cancer. Blood test confirms this.

Second, this could very easily be IBS or an ulcer and I would continue speaking to doctors until this issue can be resolved in your mind

In the mean time take Omeprazole, this completely cured the symptoms I spoke about in my original post. It's over the counter. Eat healthier, monitor your diet and rule out any possibility for a food intolerance. Instead of drinking alcohol maybe try an edible and watch a goofy podcast on YouTube (my personal recommendation is The H3podcast) , seriously make relaxation and comfort a main priority for you as much as possible 

IBS and ulcers are completely manageable, so loosen up a bit! .... No pun intended ;)

"Rant.

Everyone talks to me about their problems bc I'm ""a good listener."" But I feel so alone with my own problems.

Then I get angry and frustrated with myself for feeling alone because there are people in my life. I don't lean on them because I'm afraid they can't handle it or that leaning on them will inevitably make my life harder.

I live with my fiance, but he's had health struggles this year, as well as difficulties at work, so he has leaned on me daily, breaking down and panicking before work, calling me for 30-90 minutes a few times a week while I'm at work, breaking down when he gets home from work...after about 20 minutes each time I get overwhelmed and frustrated, but I signal anger. Then he says he feels like he has no support, so I feel like my efforts are wasted.

I have my own problems. But I shove them down and go to work, clean the house, make dinner, basically do the things that need to be done every day. I shoulder the mental load in our household.

My blood pressure has spiked the past few months. I've had a rash on my face for 2 months. I see doctors weekly for migraines and chronic back pain. My parents don't call me, my 2 closest friends both underwent cancer treatments this year, and my fiance is overwhelmed. I work from home, so my fiance is the only person I see each day.

Family's pretty important. Once they're gone, they're gone. That link to your past, and to the lived experience of another person. And of course it's someone that loves you, and (hopefully) you have some good memories about when you were both younger.

Maybe it's possible to get some help as well from some of your other family members? Like see if they can do a couple days a week, just so you can have time for yourself or for your other stuff. It's probably not fair to just stick you with taking care of your grandmother. Taking care of elderly is a big job. It can be rewarding but it can be extremely hard and draining as well.

Fear is a normal emotion that every human experiences when faced with physical or emotional threats. When a child rides a bicycle for the first time or when a fresher attends an interview or people go on a roller coaster, we are facing the fear of uncertainty. But when these emotions become intense or prolonged disturbing our thoughts and actions, it becomes anxiety. Then we need to take steps to overcome it.

"You're right there. Chronic stress can wreck havoc on all aspects of your life. Damage your health. U MUST prioritise eliminating stress from your life. This should be the main goal in your life. Forget everything else! Focus on this with complete attention and commitment. It's crucial that you transform chronic distress into occasional to manageable.


A lot of our stress originates from faulty thinking patterns/overthinking. If there are no thoughts, there's no anxiety. It's the faulty habit of our brains to keep thinking excessively, in the background. removing all thoughts gets rid of anxiety and worry. And you're left with a peaceful state of being. try this. Eliminate all your thoughts, consciously. Even if for a few secs. Just remove all thoughts from your mind on purpose. Empty your head. Maintain this state (take it as a challenge to keep your mind empty). After a while, you'll find anxiety lessening. It will go away completely if you maintain empty mind long enough.

See how relieved you feel now. Meditation helps you elongate this""empty mind"" state. It becomes second nature after a regular consistent meditation practice.Meditation stimulates the vagus nerve. Research shows that it increases vagal tone and positive emotions, and reduces intrusive thoughts + stress over time with consistent practice. You can join the Mindfulness and Meditation reddit subs. You'll meet other Meditators and be motivated, inspired by them. You'll get to connect with them and learn from them.

I'll recommend to you the following guided sleep meditations that you must listen to and follow along daily before sleeping or while resting. After a few weeks/months, see how better you'll feel. Trust me. 👍🏻 These GUIDED SLEEP MEDITATIONS are extremely soothing , relaxing and comforting. Guaranteed by the end of these sleep meditations you'll have a smile on your face, filled with joy. they're truly effective to get rid of anxiety /panic / depression / loneliness, basically any negative state of mind, the more you listen to them. Make them a regular part of your life and see the miraculous difference they make. Some amazing channels you can check out: Soothing Pod - Sleep Meditation and Bedtime Stories, Relax For A While, Down to Sleep, Happy Minds - Sleep Meditation and Bedtime Stories, Jason Stephenson - Sleep Meditation Music (involves relaxation techniques during the meditations), Michelle's Sanctuary: Sleep Stories and Meditations. (Note: avoid listening to negative emotions inducing stories, like those from crime/horror/mystery/thriller/suspense genre. These will only worsen your problems.)

These guided meditations, if you listen to them before sleeping every day, that'll be akin to a consistent daily meditation practice.

On this page, you'll find a plethora of very helpful solutions/ways using which various people have relieved their anxiety: https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/hhf8pc/what_is_the_one_thing_that_has_helped_you_most_in/ Try what suits you.

Use lavender essential oil or candles or any lavender scented item. Or any favourite scent. The smell is very relaxing. It's amazing how this smell can induce positivity and relaxation within you. Aromatherapy is a pleasant stress reliever.

Be in nature most of the time. Nature is highly healing for our bodies. Many have experienced the destressing benefits of nature exposure, especially on beaches + parks. Green and blue. The natural environments comprising these colours. 

Indulge in creative activities. You must have hobbies. You must make time for these. Watch comedy movies/draw/paint/sing dance.

Exercise. This one works like magic. Whichever type you do, doesn't matter. Just do it!

Give your body a break. Stress can be taxing to your system. So it's wise to give the body a break from having to digest processed foods. Eating nutritious real foods is healing to the body and will help you recover sooner. The brain requires a number of nutrients to function effectively and to its best potential. We get those nutrients from real foods. Processed foods deprive our bodies and brain from these very nutrients. So I'll suggest you rarely eat processed artificial foods, especially those with added sugar. In fact, sugar worsens the body's ability to cope with stress. It leads to overthinking. Causes inflammation, which worsens your health further. 
Quitting caffeine will help you too. Again, it causes overthinking. At the moment, you want your brain to calm down.
Some people found Mediterranean diet to help them when healing from stress.

Your healing is in your hands. Wish you strength. I truly hope and pray you heal soon! 😇👍🏻"	galerka	reply	na	na	na	0.9946812987327576	weak	no	no	na	stress

Hi! 19 and I'm a second year in art college. I totally get you, when I was in high school, I made the choice that I was going to community college. Although this wasnt something I wanted since I'm an artist. But in the long run, I tried my best to be positive and at least find something that could benefit me. Im an extreme overthinker so I worry about my future daily. At last minute I was told I could afford art college so I'm now attending it, but to be honest, I dont enjoy it as much as I would like to. To tell you the truth, we are always gonna be confused on what we want, but we also have to learn to stay in the present and do what we think is best, especially for our mental health. I know its easier said than done since college is something expensive, but theres also the possibility that college isnt for everybody.

All I can say, OP, is there is no single decision moment coming up once you graduate or whatever. I'm in my 30s now, and have pivoted many times, not just in career. And will probably change stuff some more. You don't have to decide everything in the next year or two.

I'm not sure what makes me happy, but I'm not worried about it. I know that what made me happy at 17 is not the same that makes me happy now - at least not regarding work/education. 

I don't live to work, I work to live. Even if I do finish school, I know already that I don't want to work as a nurse until I retire.

It's not the end of the world if it doesn't make you happy though. I would be much happier nerver working, but I need an income to do the things that actually makes me happy.

"39M (Sweden), 177 cm, 90 kg

Hey! Ok, I ask you to read below and try to put yourself in my situation.

2021-04-13:
Long story short. Had been suffering from a long-lasting cough (5-6 weeks) and sought care. The doctor heard something on the left lung and sent me for an urgent x-ray the same day.  I was terrified and thought I had lung cancer.  I was nervous and scared to death until I got my test results back.  It showed nothing but I recovered a few days later.

2021-09-14:
My wife found a liver spot/mole on my back that looked weird. This after I had complained of itching in that place 1-2 months earlier. Thought it was skin cancer and was nervous and scared to death for several weeks before I received an answer that there was no danger. The mole didn't look ""bad"" so they didn't do anything about it.

2021-10-07:
My wife finds a lump on the right shoulder blade, size approx. 1x1 cm. It can be moved but feels strange somehow.  Immediately becomes completely convinced that this is also a cancerous tumor.  Either the skin cancer has spread or it is a sarcoma (soft tissue cancer that can feel exactly like a fatty lump). Once again, I became very nervous, stressed and scared to death. I sought care and was able to see a reputable doctor who informed me that it was a lipoma. When he was about to take it away, he says he can't find it.  I imagined he saw it and it wasn't a lipoma.  He said something to the other doctor and I didn't really understand where.  He you catch me again and the lump is still there.  Instead, he sends me for an urgent MR X-ray and here I am completely destroyed.  I take him as if he has seen something that makes him not dare to cut me.  I lie at home and shake for several days and have such fear of death that it is completely sick. I end up trying to go into that X-ray tunnel but it doesn't work. Tries 3-4 times but I just lie there and cry because I'm afraid of what the x-ray will show.  Here I am completely convinced that it is cancer of some kind.  I had to cancel everything and today the lump is still there.  The doctor called me 3 weeks later and said he was 100% sure it was a lipoma and that it can stay on my body without doing any harm. So, I still have it and I'm alive.

During this course of ""diseases"" I get hemorrhoids and start having stomach problems.  I still have huge problems with my stomach (heartburn, acid regurgitation, irregular stools, stomach pain, stomach cramps, etc.).

I'm simply wondering if this could be the result of some kind of stress, nervousness, panic disorder, death anxiety over an extended period of time?

Note: I have never before had ""problems"" with my stomach (that I know of) but after the above events it is in total revolt.

Please write a line or two what you think.

Sorry for a long post, but it's important and nice for me to write a little.

"Omg - please read my story! 

The past 3 years have been extremely stressful for me. I’ve dealt with my best friend passing away, my family going broke and two back to back boyfriends dumping me.  

I’m dealing with a really bad gut situation .’m only 29 but over the summer I was on a 2 month long holiday eating crap and that’s when my stomach problems started. I had blood on my stool at the end of two months and instead of treating it as a hemmoroid because of crap food I’ve been thinking I have colon cancer. Cut to the next 6 months of constant stress and anxiety and nausea and gut issues. I’ve never got constipated in my life before so I’m stressed about colon cancer and this is making me feel even more worried. 

I’ve been to the doctor and he told me the blood may be due to some minor rectal irritation but nothing to worry about. He didn’t check me physically though. 

All my blood tests and stomach ultrasound is clear but I can’t get over the thought of having colon cancer as whenever I’m constipated there’s been blood. 

I’m an extreme hypochondriac and im going through one of the most stressful times of my life and im worried I have colon cancer twenty four seven. Im constantly naseous and I have cramps. My stomach hasn’t been the same in 7 months and I never had this problem earlier. 

Current symptoms : stomach cramps, inability to empty stomach, blood on toilet paper, swollen anus( I can feel a swelling in the area), lots of acid reflux, constantly , and constipated 

The last time I saw fresh blood was in JULY and now again In December. It’s fresh and very little but enough to make my mind spiral and think I’m dying/ I can’t switch off my brain and I’m constantly burning - farting and have reflux too! 

I’m currently dealing with a situation where my parents are broke, my boyfriend dumped me 8 months ago and our family is dealing with severe financial troubles. 

Do you think stress / anxiety are making my symptoms worse? I love to drink and I can’t even touch a drink thinking my stomach will spasm and bleed which makes me even more nervous and anxious. I’m at a loss of words and I can’t live a normal life. I want to switch off from the thought that I have a serious disease.

For context I’m a 21F in college with hopes of going to nursing school. Since I was young I’ve always been driven by my academics because if I wasn’t the prettiest in school, I definitely wanted to be the smartest. Essentially, i had one bad semester two years ago almost while being in college (parents were edging a divorce) and ive been paying the price since. It was the lowest my gpa had ever been and because of it i couldnt apply to nursing school when I wanted to- and it absolutely crushed me. So, i drove myself even more into my academics so much so to where i have panic attacks when it comes to my grades.   In simple, today was a bad day mentally. On top of school, I work two jobs as a CNA and pharmacy technician. In the mornings, I’m at the senior living facility, in the afternoons I’m in class and in the evenings im at the pharmacy. I feel like my body is addicted to stress and its finally crashing and i feel awful even considering submitting this one assignment late and risking a point deduction. Ive emailed my professor about it all and he hasnt gotten back to me but i cant pull myself to do this assignment. I feel lazy and i dont know what to do.	daxa444	post	21.498828980189504	female	White	0.9989609718322754	na	na	na	0	stress

My dad works all day long and my mom doesn’t drive so Im constantly driving my mom and my younger siblings every where. 

I work 6:30am-3pm and I usually don’t even get to sit and relax until 7pm, then Im going to bed by 8pm but i’m not falling asleep until midnight and Im up on and off all throughout the night. 

Im barely making enough money to pay my bills, and Im also the family bank to my mom and dad. Don’t get me wrong I don’t mind helping them out but they’re constantly asking to borrow money and 9 times out of 10 I don’t get it back.

"2 months ago I had a terrible fall resulting in a broken shoulder that hopefully will make a full recovery. Nerve is bruised so it’s a fairly useless arm at the moment.

Life has been strange being off work and at home. I can’t drive for now. Family has been visiting and helping drive me around for errands and appointments. most friends are settling down with a family, have moved, or are career focused etc. so I haven’t seen anyone except a best friend. Everything else has been distant communication like the odd text here and there (when it’s external of family and the best friend, that is).

It’s miraculous I didn’t hit my head. In fact it kind of puzzles me, but I was blacked out drunk (working on recovery now).

It dawned on me that maybe my existence for the past 2 months has been in a coma. That I’m in a hospital bed on life support; surrounded by family; experiences with family are my mind manifesting their conversations they have around me. 

Everything is just a manifestation of my mind but I’m actually in a coma.

I’m weirded out and there are several triggers that cause me to second guess myself.

Edit: some of the triggers I mean include that groceries is symbolism for nutrients/IV time, my parents visiting in life are just visiting me in a hospital, friends who I no longer speak with recently have actually said their good byes; an ex lover I always thought about getting back together with finally blocked me out after 4 years - I got disconnected.

Right now my friends and family are gone, family is on a trip at the moment. That may be symbolism that they too, have left. For now or ever I’m unsure.

I recently started talking a lot more with one of my brothers - but were talking about old video games and nostalgia. Everything I know about him in the present has sort of been static.

That’s one way to say it. Things appear to progress but it turns out to be static; no change happened that was perceived to be"	kerplatchu	post	33.63236137284974	male	White	0.9963041543960571	na	na	na	6	stress
"I've had the exact same thoughts in the past. 

1. If these thoughts are caused by anxiety, go see a specialist, you will probay need anti anxiety medication and everything will be fine. Speaking from experience. 

1.1. If things appear dream-like, static, if you feel disconnected from your environtment and your self, you might be suffering from depersonalization/derealization. Commoy triggered by traumatic experiences, anxiety or depression. Google it for more detailed description. 

2. You are not in a coma, because I'm a real person responding to you. You are pretty wide awake and you are asking this question on reddit in the real world. Of course you can never know whether I'm just an image of your subconscious...so...

2.1. Think rationally. 

2.1.1 You can doubt whether you are in coma or not. But you doubt over your doubt of being in a coma, too. So you are doubting your doubts. If you're doubting your doubts ---> you are not in an altered state of mind ---> you are awake. 

2.1.2. If it was a coma it would be some sort of a dream state - you would be able to do things you can't do in reality. Test it:
- try to open a portal to China. 
- try to lift the wastebin with the force of your mind. 
- try to shoot bullets from the TV remote. 

If none works - congrats - you are wide awake. 

2.1.3. If it was a coma, you wouldn't be able to learn new things. Open some calculus or chemistry books and learn something new. I highly doubt that anyone near your hypotethic coma bed would be reciting math/chemistry formulas for any reason for your subconscious to interpret as learning new things in your hypotethic coma state. 

3. You shouldn't care much whether you are awake or not. Remember that anything you do in your hypotethic coma state always affects your mind/personality/charater etc. So the choices you would make in your hypotethic coma state are as important as the choices you make in your real everyday life. They all affect who you are and how you change as a person. So, at the end, you loose nothing even if you are in a coma state.

"If you had a terrible fall, could the drinking have caused brain damage? Or could it have resulted in a minor stroke that in turn made you fall? Have you had a cat scan?

I’ve been feeling intensely depressed for almost three years now. It’s made me extremely mentally foggy and forgetful. About half a year back, at its peak, I had a sort of extended cotard’s delusion that I had died and was now in hell, a hell disguising itself as life as an added layer of torment. 

Rule out brain injury. Then psychotic depression. 

If this is a dream, wouldn’t you conduct yourself in the best way possible anyway if you had a choice — as in, to be good to yourself and those around you? There’s this old Taoist passage about a man dreaming he was a butterfly and how he wasn’t sure if he was a man formerly dreaming he was a butterfly or a butterfly currently dreaming he’s a man. My question is: would it really matter, from a practical standpoint? 

You comport yourself well. For me, it doesn’t really matter if this is a simulation or a dream or whatever. You do the best you can and with proper care to yourself and everyone around you. 

Not sure if this helps. Kind of been there. Good luck."	kerplatchu	reply	na	na	na	0.9963041543960571	no	strong	strong	na	stress

Life has so many chapters to it that you will likely end up doing many different things across the years. I would take the pressure off and follow your bliss.

Think of life as something to enjoy. Career is just a small aspect of life; until and unless you turn a passion into a career. To do that, you need to uncover what you're passionate about.

Make that you're focus, follow what you're passionate about, simply because it's fun. No one knows what 'career' they should be in. Most guess and then change it up later.

"Hello.

I have had stress symptoms for almost a year. 2 months ago it started getting real bad. I couldn’t eat or sleep.
A month ago I went on sick leave from work.

My nervous system has finally seemed to calm down this past week, and my restlessness has been replaced by increasing tiredness. I started being able to eat properly and sleep properly most night this past week. Today I have been ridiculously tired though.

Woke up at 7 am, fell back asleep, slept till 10:30, felt like sleeping more but got up. Now it’s 18:45 and I feel like going to bed.
Is that normal??
My recent bloodwork looks normal, though my vitamin d is a tad too low (we’re talking 0.1 too low) and a protein is too low too (also 0.1 too low). The last one is because of my hernia causing me not being able to eat enough."	ariegnes	post	20.690665504756677	female	White	0.9881427884101868	na	na	na	3	stress
"I think it makes a lot of sense. It's not the same but when I have anxiety I feel very tired once I'm relaxed, and specially after anxiety attacks I loose all strength in my body. For example I can't manage to open easy things like water bottles, sometimes I can't even hold things with my hands or use my arms. So I think it's very normal that after weeks of being in ""alert mode"" your body shuts down. When I go through periods of heavy stress I usually feel unable to do anything afterwards, and it's common to get sick.

"I know life is supposed to be difficult. I know stressful things can happen, and that most of us learn how to cope in a healthy way. Eating right and exercising are supposed to make us healthy and happy, both physically and mentally. We're supposed to have hobbies (beginner at knitting) to keep us occupied and to do our duties, which manifests in the job that I do almost every day. We need to have a network of support from friends and family. Life isn't just what happens to you, it's how you react to it. That's what I tell myself.

Yet it seems that life, or at least my life, is just one stressful event after another. Be it getting rear-ended and struggling with insurance for a few months, a single parent's boyfriend showing up who stresses you out for the next few, transferring from one branch to another in your job, looming deadlines, and the knowledge that you have to eat healthily and sleep at least 8 hours a night or you're going to get sick...etc. etc. etc. Many times I'm happy and I catch myself wondering when the next bad thing is going to happen. WITHOUT FAIL, it does. I deal with it successfully, and it's on to the next one! Over and over and over again, catching moments of pleasure and peace in between. It's not a very good comparison, but it's kind of like Dark Souls, where you die your way through instead of playing your way through.

I'm slowly being chipped away at. I've built an extraordinarily healthy way of living, but it seems at this point that it's just a tower I've built over a foundation under continuous assault by the elements that I'm constantly repairing.

I've been tired. So tired. It's like I died a long time ago, and I'm only 23. I know everybody deals with constant stressors, so is everyone secretly feeling this way? Is it all drowned in alcohol? drugs? Religion? Are we supposed to naturally numb ourselves with age? This can't be all that life is!

My grandfather eats junk food. He stands or sits around for most of the day and sometimes he goes for a walk before coming home and eating. He's been through the Vietnam war and lost almost everything. Despite sleep apnea, cancer, a fat-rich diet, and falling once, he's still thriving in his eighties. No one gets to that point unless they've got it all figured out inside.

There's something obvious I'm missing, something that appears to make all the difference. I don't think a girlfriend will fix this, nor will any big purchases or materialism. Ideally, I'd have a life of inner peace and contentment, filled with steady but peaceful determination. Otherwise, life has no meaning to it."

Unfortunately just after I was done, I found that the thing DIDN’T record anything at all, even though I was sure I pressed the record button on it! 

Now I’ve spent the majority of the day stressed out at the fact that I had to rely on my memory to try to replay what my eye doctor’s informed me of when my mind’s already on too many things to begin with!

"I feel like there is no solution, but perhaps someone here can share some insights...

This is the 9th year I will be living with my mom. I never thought it would be almost a decade!!

She stresses me out like no one else can. And that is not only wanting to do every little thing for me, but also affording me ver little privacy.

Also, I am never ever just relaxing. This is probably the reason my shoulders and neck are stiff as a plank, my weight doesn't go down, always tired, always on the verge of tears, and a few other minor health issues (let's hope they don't become bigger issues!)

I want to move out but finance does not allow it. 

I gym 3 to 4 times a week, try to eat healthy, sleep 8 hours, take a stack of supplements, but find no joy in hobbies or socializing (mostly because when I get back home she looks at me with doe eyes because why did I go off without her) 

I often play with my budget to see when/if I can move out, but so far no luck.

Ok so normally I am a very stressed person, like I'm constantly on edge, biting  my nails, and when I finish biting my nails, I bite some of the skin off in the area. I never really thought about it too much until I just looked at my hands and I noticed how bad it was. So I took a day off to relax and spend the day just making sure to not use my brain too much  or do anything particularly stressful, like playing a hard videogame or solving a hard puzzle and it was alright. But here's the problem, now I feel like I can't just go back because every time I try to do something that might need concentration, I can feel my heart just going back to that level of stress and i just can't.

"Yes. A part of me does not want to let go of childhood. Also, I come from a family with genetic defects, bodily complexes, stoicism and religious baggage.

I tried to build up some self-esteem with exercise. But since I have a testosterone deficiency since childhood. I do not gain mass. In fact, my distribution of muscle mass is terrible. I look anorexic no matter what I do. Almost, as if there had been some inbreeding along my genetic lineage.

Also, I experience ADHD since childhood. So, there are some problems going on with my limbic system as well, it seems, which may be causing the chronic stress disorder. And when people look at my body in the streets, they look down with serious sadness. Like... ufff.

But yeah. This makes the people in my family very weak, infantilized, irresponsible, resentful and self-destructive. We are genetically predisposed to be homeless or junkies. Because none of us has moved from our comfort zone in more than twenty years, and we are constantly hooked onto something to make us feel better.

Mostly because of the crippling anxiety, chemical depression and self-hatred. But that's about it. We stumble, and that part of me that cannot become a fully realized man, wants to return to childhood.

"Like a weak animal in nature. You are naturally more afraid of your surroundings. Which triggers the anxiety. It was the same with my mother, and with me. Especially in college where people have not been reformed by social rules and regulations to enforce punishment for offense, often leading to bullying and harassment.

My mother and me experienced bullying because our physical inferiority due to problems with our endocrine system. Making for anxious, anti-social, resentful and avoidant adults. It makes sense. Especially during those formative years.

I mean, I would have been the one doing the bullying, had I been any stronger. The same way my mother verbally abused his mentally ill father when he was too weak to defend himself, because she is always in so much pain, herself.

"i've been so negligent with everything in my life. my head feels full. i neglected applying for leave early enough and was called out in front of my entire team (indirectly. my name wasn't mentioned). i'm wondering why i did that?? why did i delay applying for simple leave? i feel so guilty and ashamed, but i also have the feeling that i'm beating myself up too much for it 

though, this isn't an isolated incident.

i was meant to deliver assets to another team but neglected to double-check if we had all the assets to deliver. instead, i ignored the issue. the team eventually called me out for it. ideally I should've flagged the issue and had them deal with it... but i was just too lazy?? it wasn't even a big deal. nothing arduous, but i got too lazy. what's worse is that I didn't own up to my mistake.

i feel soooo ashamed, wow. i don't know what's up. i'm slipping lately, in the most tiny, unnecessary ways but it's making me feel so anxious and disappointed in myself.

My brain simply refused to deal with everything, and I tended to forget / ignore things which were not a direct life-threat. :)

Like as in constantly wanting to provoke or illicit a response out of people to get them to respond a certain way. Sometimes I look for evidence in their actions or behavior that may not even actually exist to feed my preexisting notion or mindset. It can be VERY unhealthy. I have come to terms with the fact that I OVERLY obsess about what others think of me. I am constantly thinking about what other people think of me and my insecurities. I think that they will judge me based on things that only I know about myself or that I am hyper vigilant about.		follow-up	na	na	na	0.010258300229907036	no	strong	no	na	stress

"Former chronic worrier here. I look at it this way. You have a choice: you can:
A) worry unproductively and cause yourself distress, poor health, and emotional pain, and not enjoy your time up until “the event” you’re worrying about; or,
B) enjoy your time, free from distress, anxiety, and pain up until “the event”

Because either way, the thing you’re worrying about will (or will not) happen. All you’ve got is the time you have, and you can choose to make the best of it. Or you can choose to make yourself miserable. 

I am concerned about WW3 as well. I’m concerned about asteroids, terror attacks, climate change, a recession, cancer, getting hit by a car, you name it.

So with the way the conflict is going right now, I don't think you need to worry about a full scale World War 3 and I think you can give yourself permission to lay those fears to rest!

"I occasionally get mind chatter. Kicked off last year. Combination of intense career, studies and ill health in the family.

I do have a suggestion, but it's quite drastic. Not drastic in that it will cause you any detriment. But some feel like it's an additional discomfort they don't need at an already uncomfortable time of their livellfe.

But.

Cold showers.

Get in the shower, and whack the temp down as cold as it can go. 

This helped me a lot. When I felt like my mind/thoughts were racing away, I just had a cold shower. There is science behind it, but the shock of the cold water and my bodies attempt to deal with it immediately erases all of the other nonsense in my head away. Also, it will stimulate the release of endorphins which should make you feel calmer long after you get out the shower.

I'm not convinced on the theories surrounding permanent erasement of stress. But for mind chatter, or as I call it, feeling scattered. It worked wonders for me.

"I wonder if I’m the only one sometimes going through all this . Anyway I’m a 35 year old male living in Los Angeles working soon will have my own apartment in a few months because of my autism ( though most people don’t know I’m autistic). I have a roommate currently. I am originally from the sf Bay Area and while I loved it there I needed a change . Weather for one thing and LA just seemed so exciting and it is . Anyway I moved here in 2018 and love it . So I’m happy in the city I live in , but I’m not happy with the circumstances of the last two years and instead of looking back I’m trying to look forward and realize my lie isn’t over and boring and useless. First off I used to go the gym and run and eat healthy, and I was in much better shape  obviously. Than Covid came my work hours changed and so did my diet along with everything else. I work retail so those who work it or have will know exactly what I’m talking about. So in 2022 I tried to restart by going back to being a vegetarian, forcing myself to go back to the gym etc, but my motivation is just not there yet . I do have a small social life so I’m thankful for that and I am also a photographer as I love all the architecture in this city . But I need more friends my age I’m
Guessing and there just seem to be no women who aren’t partiers or who would let me be myself with them . Or maybe I’m looked at as asexual or unattractive. Anyways I just need something more exciting than just work and home . I wish I had a group o could do things with but of course my schedule makes it tough .

My dating/sex history:
I was never very good at asking women out even though most of my life I was told I was extremely handsome I’m tall 6”1 blonde hair , brown eyes . I was told I could have modeled when I was younger . Anyway I didn’t lose my virginity till I was 20 which is late but partly because i was shy , just not confident. I had an opportunity to be that girls boyfriend who I lost my virginity to but I just decided I didn’t want a relationship with her , well between 2007 and 2009 I had no heterosexual sex but desired it but was insecure, etc . I’ll admit because I grew up in San Francisco and had gay friends I even experimented with gay men as a way out since I was just not having relationships with women but I realized obviously I was not gay or bi since I didn’t feel attracted to men . Than I’m 2010 I had sex with a drunk cougar and that was one and done . I had a disasterous date with a woman in the mission district in sf and it was horrible. I than tried going to “ cougar bars” with my friend but of course we would never go home with anyone, and it wasn’t my scene anyway. Than in 2012 I met my first girlfriend who was older than me at a class. Funny thing is I liked her immediately and she clearly liked me . We saw the Batman dark knight movie which was our first date in 2012. Well we fucked like crazy so much so that I felt it was a bit much and the non sexual side of our relationship seemed kinda ehhh….
Well I eventually drove her away and regretted it . And since then I’ve slept with a few older women from 2015-2019. But since Covid I’ve had no sex except masturbation . Partly I still do struggle with being insecure and feeling like Women will never be into me which I know is nonsense of course . But I am now have a strange sense of being torn on one hand I would like to be in a relationship, on the other hand my life is busy enough with work and exploring stuff in LA with my camera . I almost feel like the woman would have to be perfect for me because I feel like maybe my earlier history told me something that I’m just someone who lost their virginity late and because of it maybe it messed me up or maybe I’m better off just with a few friends and my own life . Partly I think I need someone who I can be myself around them without judgment and I’m trying to change . Maybe I’m just to weird or absent minded . I try to work on my confidence and I try to
Fake it till I make it but that can only last so long . I do have confidence issues and while I’m secretive about it deep inside I feel like most women are either judging me or think I’m unattractive , or that I’m gay. 

I guess I need to work on myself . I want to get back into shape , eat healthier, exercise like I used to . Also I use to shave everyday clean shaven and short hair but when Covid came I got lazy. I’m going to try and get myself together and work on myself. I take my medication for depression which helps and I do have a therapist but I can’t see her as much as I’d like . I do have challenges but I always try to work through them 

My issues with sex, relationships, asking women out :
I have often had issues with asking women out , etc. it’s weird maybe I am incel yet I don’t blame my problems on women I blame it all on myself that I’m my own worst enemy. I tend to shoot myself in the foot . It’s weird because I don’t consider myself repressed. I grew up in a liberal household in San Francisco. I also am not a right winger as most incels are . I am liberal . Anyways so most men can ask a woman out with no problem and nothing would faze them . I on the other hand have trouble because I don’t want to make a fool of myself, come off as creepy etc . Good example is there is this customer at work who I like and comes in most everyday . Her and I talk quite a bit when I’m helping her and we smile at each other . And I think she likes me , but probably just being friendly. Two of my colleagues know I like her and always ask “ Have you asked her out yet “ I always give an excuse or that she wouldn’t want to have anything to do with me that way.  So other guys could just ask a woman out with no issue but not me. Also I’m not at my best right now and want to get back to being healthy and exercise. The funny thing is I can talk to beautiful women because I do every day because I work in Beverly Hills and I can engage and be friendly but on my own I don’t seek out to talk to women because of my own fear as how they view me. The funny thing is I did ask my ex gf out but it wasn’t really a “date asking her out it was more casual and things developed. I just wonder if I can overcome these issues that have been plaguing me for a good chunk of my life . I just sometimes feel I’m cursed .h"	Toddkrasinski	post	28.754848075545105	female	White	0.00475205946713686	na	na	na	5	stress

"I find stress and anxiety cause a lot of disorganized and distressful thoughts that can keep my hormones levels off balance and make it hard to sleep.

So my technique is to counter that by telling myself a story in my head and fighting my own urge to revert back to those topics that just keep me stressed.

It sounds cliche, but there's a reason we went to sleep to stories as a kid, and it works just as well for me as an adult. Usually asleep within 20min.

Doesn't have to be a good story. Doesn't have to be some melodramatic saga. Just pick a light amusing topic and tell yourself about it. When you find yourself accidentally skipping back to the negative thoughts, just say ""oh... Where was I?"" and start back from where you remember.

"I've heard people tell me they feel ridiculous doing it, but honestly... It's in your own head. Only you can hear it. You don't have to tell anyone what your story is or what happens.

If you want to be a superhero and save the day, fucking awesome, tell that story.

If you want to go dancing at some club and meet fun people, fucking awesome, invent some fun friends for the night. Name one Maya!!

It doesn't matter how spectacular or mundane the story is, the goal is to order your thoughts, allow the hormones in your brain to self-regulate, and for sleep to take hold.

I would caution about telling yourself stories about yourself or somebody succeeding at something you're anxious or stressed about, it's too easy to slip into the negative thoughts that are keeping your Cortisol levels too high.

Make your story something wholly separate from your troubles."	bernard6ve	reply	na	na	na	0.9943004846572876	weak	no	no	na	stress
I think way too deep into SO many things and I can’t get out of it. I’m trying to collect older video games and systems (N64, SNES that kinda stuff) but I’m always thinking like “what if it works fine when I buy it and 2 days later it breaks and I have to get new parts and they have to make new parts with metal and plastic and in the process I am helping to hurt the environment and I’m a bad person for wanting to fix my game cartridge” A STUPID GAME CARTRIDGE IS CAUSING ME STRESS (and it’s not even Superman 64.

So there's this guy. An ex ss officer. He fell in love with a jewish prisoner in Auschwitz and had a relationship with her. After the war he tried to contact her to be with him, but she wanted nothing more to do with him, so he started a new life, family, got married . He had this one picture ofher(in her auschwitz prisoner uniform) , and he used to cut out her head and put her on another clothing, away from Auschwitz. He used to do this for the most of his life (the filmaker says it was a way for him to imagine an alternative life they could have had).He copied the picture and kept it in his wallet until the day he died. So when his daughter was 16 she said her father told her about this Jewish girl, and that he never ever in his life felt true love like that. He even gave his daughter a locket with a picture of him and his ex Jewish girlfriend, not her mother. His daughter said it was odd, and she also said that this Jewish girl was the love of his life(in a documentary, there was a documentary made about them). So the filmmaker which is close to both his and Jewish girls families said that the ss officer was deeply and truly in love in this Jewish girl, till the day he died. His wife also knew about his ex.So in 1972 he had to go to the court because of his war crimes against humanity, and his ex Jewish girlfriend was a witness,when he saw her after 30 years of no contact he started to cry. Does that mean even while married to his wife he loved his ex girlfriend more? Does that mean that he would maybe leave his wife for her?

To fly through my background I was abused pretty heavily growing up and have always been very hyper vigilant. Meaning I've had a lot of stress my entire life. Recently I've started to take notice of how old I and others look. I'm obsessed with guessing how old people are, whenever I find someone who I think is my age or looks as old as I do I find they're at least 5 years if not 10 years older than me. I'm only 21 and I feel like I already look older than my 6 year older brother. My cheeks are hollow and my hair is thin. My skin looks rough and my skin complexion is uneven. It's rough. I don't know how to accept this. It feels so unfair and I'm struggling to deal with it. I obviously don't KNOW if I'm any older than I am and am looking into having my biological age tested but all the physical and cognitive markers or age are showing. Has anyone else dealt with this? I feel like I've had 10 or so of the best and healthiest years of my life stolen from me.	SoozlesNoodles	post	38.514675052452105	female	White	0.9945870637893677	na	na	na	2	stress

"""Chronic Stress"" is all in your head and the meaning you are attaching to things.

Typically when people are ""Stressed"" you are thinking too much about future things that will likely never happen.

People who are ""depressed"" are caught thinking in the past.

The easiest way to combat this is to live in the present and ask yourself every morning ""What can I do today that will help me have a better tomorrow?"". Then just focus on that all day.

This is advice my mentor gave me years ago and its made a world of difference for me.

Nothing is worth more than your 8 hours of sleep; you need to lower your workload to 10hours a day AT MOST.

Try sleeping when your body tells you that you need sleep. If you're on your own and don't have a boss, then maybe you need to sleep during the day and work at night. When you have to use the bathroom you don't fight your body, you just do it. When you're hungry you eat. Why should sleep be any different, if you're tired then sleep. Everyone says 7-9 hours, 12 hours, 11 hours. It's whatever your body needs.	Damanjain	reply	na	na	na	0.9981192946434021	no	no	no	na	stress

Is it normal to not be able to keep the house clean and catch up on basic household chores. My wife and I work opposite schedules so that we don't have to rely on day care or a babysitter. We have a 16 month old daughter, 2 cats and a dog. I try my best to keep the house tidy but little detail stuff like dusting, vacuuming and mopping seem almost impossible to do and after a day it looks like nothing even got done. Outside chores is a race while she naps during the day and what ever doesn't get done has to wait for a second nap or another day. By no means is my house filthy but there are a lot of projects I can't seem to start and trying to just maintain it is a project in itself. Before the kid I was able to do a lot more but between her and trying to get basic stuff done while working is very draining. Normally I'd wait till the evening to do something after she goes to bed but lately I just wanna play on my phone or watch a movie. I love my family with all my heart and would not change a thing, I'm just stressed because I think of everything that needs to get done and it causes me to procrastinate even more. As a new parent I just need to hear whether or not this is normal. I've been told that one day I'll miss all the hustle and bustle and noise.	wolfey200	post	23.35486836669874	male	White	0.9984682202339172	na	na	na	5	stress

Being social can be scary too. But it’s very rewarding once you get out there. It’s always fun to hear someone else’s stories and experiences, or just share a joke in passing. Take small steps. Buy a cup of coffee and make conversation with your barista. Place an order at a fast food place, ask the server how their day is going. Check out your local library - sometimes they have meet and greets that align with your hobbies. 
Apply to some jobs, just simple ones first. Ring someone up at the grocery store, seat people in a restaurant.

Any suggestions, natural supplements, vitamins, food, exercises, would be greatly appreciated!	user_467	post	27.935040294537778	male	White	0.9980435371398926	na	na	na	3	stress
Magnesium is a natural muscle relaxant and it helps you sleep too. There are different forms so you may want to look for something specific to stress cramping. Good luck! I hope you feel better ❤️	user_467	reply	na	na	na	0.9980435371398926	weak	no	no	na	stress

"I want to preface this post with that in theory I love my job. Back in August I found a job that I actually enjoy doing, but my coworkers are stressing me out so horribly that I have allergic reaction like hives on the right side of my face and neck. 
I work at a gym in the daycare center and as of late we’ve been getting an influx of gym members, which in turn means more children.  At my gym we have two different rooms for childcare. We have a childcare room for toddlers (where I work) and then we have “kids club” for elementary school age kids. There is more than the age difference between the two rooms. Kids club is a much larger room and has more mature toys such as monster high dolls, Jenga, and a giant connect four. This room is better equipped for a larger group of kids. The other room is basically a glorified supply closet which is perfect for small children. 
Now we got that out of the way I can get to why I’m here: 
Between these two room there is supposed to be two people working, one in child care and one in kid’s club, but as of late I’ve been the only person scheduled for any form of daycare. It’s  been extremely difficult to manage the toddlers and making sure the older kids are okay. I’ve been stressing so hard about making sure everyone is safe and enjoying themselves while I have 3 toddlers crying to be picked up and now I have two special needs children now. The right side of my face and neck is breaking out in hives. I need a new job."	Bxnnyxoxo2000	post	17.1753290052008	female	White	0.9993377327919006	na	na	na	2	stress

My in laws has been so controlling over my two boys. They try and basically tell me what I need to do and what not to do... Sometimes they make me feel like I'm a bad mother! And it from thing like me sending my kids to public school to them getting the mandatory shots to attend school... Or the fact that I don't doing anything with politics because it's not something I'm very educated with and that's because I never showed interest so their for I don't vote and they think I should just go vote for who they tell me to because it's my children future and I'm a bad person cause I dont. They make me feel like I'm going crazy!!! Husband agrees with me and tells me to just let them go and let it be... But then theirs part of me that feels bad because my kids have a great bond with them. So I'm basically stuck in the middle of letting them out of my life and enjoy peace or just continue to allow their behavior so my boys are happy! There's so much more to it that's stressful.

So I struggle with criticism. On the moment I'm contradicted on a subject, I doubt just about everything I know. It's a huge problem. I will become extremely anxious and self pity, if I don't get defensive. Typically if someone else is wrong or criticized even at the smallest degree at a similar time, it's like instant relief, but that isn't a given. How should I learn to take criticism so I'm actually a better person from it?	VampyreBassist	post	12.770805513712954	female	White	0.9967057108879089	na	na	na	6	stress
"This is something I am still working on myself but I can say that being aware of this problem is half the battle. We are all imperfect in one way or another. Some people have growth mindsets developed from a young age, others fear failure and criticism to a detrimental level (I am 100% the latter). 

It is not easy, but recognizing the signs of this problem as it occurs can help by simply being mindful of it. If you find yourself beating yourself up after a mistake or critique is assessed, you have to remind yourself that you are human and subject to make mistakes or fail to reach perfection instantly. Criticism is a tool you can used to evaluate your progress towards whatever objective or goal you have, helping you navigate towards the best available course to be better going forward.

I am by no means someone who is successful at this all of the time (frankly I almost never am but this has been a point of focus for me lately). It has taken years of my wife telling me to stop talking down to myself and simply be more objective (or less emotional) about failures and critiques. I have a long way to go but recently caught myself in a spiral after a comment from my boss and I was able to navigate through it with more ease and less detriment to my mood and my self-esteem. I had to work through it nevertheless, my knee-jerk response kicked in before my more objective side was able to evaluate the comment and take it less personally and more as an opportunity to learn and grow."

She is very active in dance and cheer but has been upset recently about her dance instructor focusing on her being ""pigeon-toed"". She has also been talking a lot about her ""arches"" and her feet hurting outside of dance. Anyway, I picked her up from dance tonight and she seemed upset and said it was due to Ms Caitlyn talking about her feet again but then seemed fine. 10 minutes later out of nowhere she blurted out ""this is really weird but sometimes I just want to jump out of the car"" and started crying.

"I have a feeling she’s having some sort of “Imposter syndrome”. In case that sounds serious/scary to you, let me just say that it’s something that happens to everyone once in a while and it’s normal. If anything, it’s happened to your daughter early. There’s often this time where we get upset even by the smallest mistakes/injuries that cause us to not do as how we’d normally perform an activity. We start feeling like we have reached a stage where we feel like “we are losing touch, of what was once easy to us.” and that causes us to be upset. 

When I failed my first college entrance exam by few marks to some of my friends, I felt shocked and upset and started having similar thoughts. And in fact things got even worse when I started performing worse than how I used to do before in simple mock tests that I used to ace. “Am I losing it? What?… I used to do these kind of stuff so easy before, now what?” And eventually there came a stage where I started getting thoughts like what your daughter had… “What if I felt like jumping out of this building from this floor? Coma?…” and that drove me to depression real quick. It’s almost as if you just want to be at a peaceful corner real quick and just want to leave all this stressful, competitive environment where you feel like you are losing… 

Advice? I’d just recommend her to take it easy and maybe take a break for a while and be at peace with her friends or with her family (best with her family mostly).

I’m (22F) starting to get a stress headache thinking about work on Wednesday.

Start watching videos about money counting, beginners maths and calulus and google math sites. There are a lot more people in the world with the same math problems as you have and luckily there are a lot of people sharing their skills and teaching them to others.

"Here is an idea that may help you if you embrace it.

Always remember this "" You are always living and experiencing the feelings of your thoughts"" 

Yes , you may or may not have been diagnosed with learning issues but become very aware of your thoughts when you experience any unresourceful or negative feeling.....it is always coming from a thought or series of thoughts at that moment.  

So begin to make yourself aware of your thoughts in the moments of negative feelings. That awareness alone will help you to change the current feelings to a more positive resourceful state of being by changing your thoughts.

Next, do this.....anytime you are having a unresourceful thought change it to a preference.

For example:  If you thinking "" I'm not good at math""  Change it to a ""preference"" to "" I would prefer to be better at math and will be on the lookout for any opportunities to do so"" This is a powerful change method.

Lastly, another easy but very effective thing to do when encountering negative feelings besides changing your thoughts and preferences is to become very aware or mindful of your present moment. 

 A great way to do this, is to become aware of your breathing, the depth, the speed etc. Most negative feelings are created by thoughts about the future (worry) or thoughts about the past (regret) but in the now, the present you are alive. ok, breathing, and guess what....even happy.  The present is all you have to work with as it is the only place you can live , control and experience life as it happens.  The present is a great gift....that's why it's called the present. Live more in the present and create an even better happier life.

You can create a great past and a promising future by experiencing life fully in the present where worry and regret cannot live unless you allow and choose it.

""It' your life, take charge and do it now and above are some great tips on how""

"While fear, shock, and disgust are typically seen as negative emotions that we want to avoid, they can also be an enjoyable experience in certain situations.

Horror movies are one of the best examples of this. When you’re watching a horror movie about ghosts, zombies, serial killers, aliens, or monsters, your nervous system naturally kicks into gear as if you’re experiencing a real threat from your environment.

**This** [**fight, flight, or freeze**](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/the-complete-guide-to-daily-stress/)**-response creates a biochemical rush of adrenaline, endorphins, and dopamine, which can create a type of “natural high.”**

However, while your body experiences the “natural high” of a real threat, your brain knows deep down that you’re actually safe and secure – and there’s no real danger present.

One early [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00995932) published in the journal *Motivation and Emotion* looked into why people enjoy eating really spicy foods (such as chili peppers) and found a similar response.

Chili enjoyers still feel the same irritation and pain of eating spicy foods as everyone else, but they enjoy the rush of adrenaline and endorphins it produces. It stimulates the body’s “warning system” in a harmless and risk-free way that can be exciting and exhilarating.

This type of [positive thrill-seeking](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/positive-thrill-seeking/) can be found in many other relatively safe and harmless activities, such as riding rollercoasters, extreme sports, skydiving, an intense workout, or playing competitive video games.

**New psychology research shows that the experience of negative emotions (in a safe and controlled context) can be very enjoyable and beneficial.**

One [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30307264/) published in the scientific journal *Emotion* found that “voluntarily arousing negative emotions” (VANE) – such as purposely making ourselves scared – can lead to an overall boost in mood, like when we watch a horror movie or visit a haunted house.

The study looked at individuals who bought tickets for an “extreme haunted house” event, which was designed to elicit a variety of negative emotions such as anxiety, fear, shock, and disgust.

After the “haunted house” experience, most individuals reported an overall boost in euphoria and positive mood, especially if they felt tired, bored, or stressed beforehand.

While the sample is biased (people who buy tickets to haunted houses are more likely to enjoy them), the study does reveal that some people genuinely enjoy scaring themselves.

Furthermore, the study found that individuals who enjoyed the haunted house experience also showed less stress while completing subsequent cognitive and emotional tests (including showing less reactivity in the brain during those tests, as measured by EEG recordings).

Researchers theorize that “voluntarily arousing negative emotions” (VANE) can teach us how to better deal with future stress and anxiety.

This is a common technique behind a lot of *exposure therapy*, where a person is gradually put into a fearful situation so they become more “desensitized” to some irrational fear or phobia. For example, a person scared of flying may be asked by a therapist to visualize themselves getting on a plane until they learn to manage their fear better.

By actively exposing ourselves to fear, shock, or disgust in a safe and controlled way, we get to practice regulating these emotions in the moment, which is an important pillar of [emotional intelligence](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/4-fundamental-pillars-of-emotional-intelligence/).

**Horror movies** ***simulate*** **extraordinary experiences that we normally wouldn’t have in the real world. When we watch a horror movie, we put ourselves in the protagonist’s position and ask ourselves,** ***“What would I do in this situation?”***

New research shows fans of horror movies may even be more prepared to face real-world catastrophes.

One fascinating [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7492010/) published in *Personality and Individual Differences* discovered that fans of “horror movies” and “pandemic movies” were more resilient during the COVID pandemic. It was also found that fans of “prepper” genres in particular (alien-invasion, apocalyptic, and zombie films) exhibited both greater resilience and preparedness.

This is one reason why “pandemic” movies such as *Contagion* and *28 Days Later* showed a huge spike in popularity during COVID.

Ultimately, horror movies give us a chance to face our fears and practice [mentally rehearsing](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/mental-rehearsal-changing-habits-through-the-power-of-visualization/) how we would respond in extremely intense situations. As the famous horror writer Stephen King once said, “A good horror story help us understand our own deepest fears.”"	Lightfiend	post	27.250668533782004	male	White	0.001782179344445467	na	na	na	1	stress

When it comes to dealing with stress, we’re often told the best things we can do are exercise, make time for our favorite activities, or try meditation or mindfulness.

But the kinds of foods we eat may also be an effective way of dealing with stress, according to research published by me and other members of APC Microbiome Ireland.

Our latest study has shown that eating more fermented foods and fiber daily for just four weeks had a significant effect on lowering perceived stress levels.

"I am 28 years old and my birthday is tomorrow. I am not the one who cares much about my age or celebrates it. However i am having a very bad week and seem too stressed out. 

To start with, i was on a weekend trip with my girl friends to relax and meet after 2 long years. It was fun. But i am always the 3rd wheel in that friendship. They both are nice to me and they wish well for me. But i am the complete opposite of them. They are funny , crack jokes , extrovert and i am none of it. I just listen to them and enjoys the company sort of. They are good looking and can carry themselves. I am bit on the fatty side and does not look much good in the pictures. I think it always bothers me. 

Anyways , i come back from the trip and thought to stay with my boyfriend for some days. I feel lonely even when he is around. He gets very excited about his work and talks continuously about it. I am very much discouraged and demotivated by it even though i should not. He helped with a lot of stuff at work. I keep wondering why i am not excited as much as he is. I am interested in doing my work but i am not an expert. Just an average person at work. But i am a team lead too and the management part of comes easily for me. 

I normally handles the new joinee mentorship, any documentations, managing the team calls , setting up sessions. Somewhat what a culture team would do. I like doing this but i don't want to be known for it. Anyways past week, my department head called me up and said he sending some names selected for attending a training and asked to review it. I thought I might be in it but i was not. Every lead except me which made me very sad. I do not know why i was not even considered. I am not that bad. Yet again. 

This all happened when i was still at my boyfriend's place. I don't think he knows i was struggling with all this negative vibes happening. Still i thought i will hold my head high. I started going through my drive which the girls uploaded the pics of us. I don't normally go through it. I thought i might as well because my sister was asking for pics. So i selected some which i looked better with them. I thought i will send some good ones and some bad ones for the fun of it. The moment i send it, she replied telling me i look terrible in it. That I have put on too much weight and no one would tell this to my face. By that point, i was breaking down. I was crying hard and was feeling so much heavy in my heart. I was with my boyfriend and yet he does not know my heart was breaking with all the pain. I don't if i should blame him or I should have gone to him. May be he does not know i am struggling and i am not willing to tell him my struggles. 

So i texted my sister back, "" yup, i know"". I don't think she know i was upset. Then my second sister texted me saying i should take care of my health. Our family has diabetes genes. She was telling me the same thing. I was okay with her msging but i am very upset with the other sister for bitching about my weight. I only send pics to her. 

This all happened on Friday. At work, i did literally nothing. I could not do anything. I keep thinking about hypothetical scenarios and to wishful thinking if i could just leave everything behind. It was so much pain. 

Tomorrow is my birthday and i want to be alone..just alone. I don't know what to do. I don't know if this birthday is the thing that's making me miserable. But honestly i am not worried about getting aged. I am just tired. I know I should not expect people to come to you. But oh man I wish i could have someone who can feel me and i can open up to. I know i have people to talk. People will listen to me. But i can't open up to them. Everything is bottled up inside and i am so so stressed and sad and what not.

I was hoping someone could offer me some advice, I have been over stressed for far too long, and it has made me sick for months! My body needs a break but nothing seems to help. I have lost 70 pounds and am borderline malnourished, struggling to get by day to day. Have tried everything from exercise to therapy, and in between. Just can’t seem to relax. Any lesser known coping mechanisms, even meds to suggest would be greatly appreciated!	SweetTrippy-	post	41.88508272281101	female	White	0.9990056157112122	na	na	na	3	stress
I'm in the same boat. I'm seeing a therapist that specializes in panic disorder next week. Previously, I've taken Ashwagandha and that worked for about a month until it stopped, and hasn't worked since. There's always cannabis. 5mg/day could help you eat at least one good meal/day.

"Do you know what you are stressed about? The best thing to do is try to resolve whatever is causing the stress. If it’s school, taking proactive measures to study, plan time, take breaks etc. or have a conversation with teacher etc. if it’s work consider looking for a new job etc… without more info it’s difficult to advise. 

Try to take time out of the day to breathe, go for a nice walk, maybe a bath and chill with a cup of tea and biscuit, listen to music. Is there anyone you can talk to? Maybe a trusted adult? You could also try taking CBD drops under the tounge, I find those help. Or Kalms tablets. What is your diet and water intake looking like? Are you looking after yourself? Having a nice shower, clean clothes, warm sanctuary for a bedroom. Happy to advise if you have any more info X"		reply	na	na	na	0.9989544153213501	no	no	strong	na	stress
What do you have replaying in your head, and twitching when you lay down might not be anything. Your body could just be tired. Mine does this every night. Whatever is going on in your head the most during the day is probably it. Also identify if it’s stress or if it’s just extra energy, are you tense and on edge? Are you unhappy? Or are you just cranked up like you drank too much pop and can’t wind down. Sometimes it’s dumb shit. If you drink pop, try cutting it out or at least down.

So, I’m currently super stressed and I don’t feel like I have anyone to talk to. I’ve suffered with depression for a long time and I recently got a puppy. I’ve wanted another dog for about 10 years and I thought it was a good time to get one now since I’m WFH. The puppy is about 3 months old and at around 2 months, she started throwing up. I took her to the emergency vet and found out she had an obstruction in her intestines. This meant she had to have surgery and her insurance hasn’t kicked in so I had to pay out of pocket. I had to take out a credit card to pay the 7K bill. She came home and was doing really well. Then 2 days ago she started throwing up again. She threw up around 6 times. I took her back to the vet and they had to run a bunch of tests again (another 1K) and it seems like a treat I gave her may have irritated her intestines again. They wanted to do more tests but I literally can not afford it. I spoke to the vet about it as none of this can be covered by insurance. The vet gave her an anti nausea medication and sent us home to observe her. She ate and hasn’t vomited but I’m still nervous about it all. I really got the dog in hopes that it would also help with my depression but it’s becoming worse due to all of this…I feel helpless and I can’t afford to take her back to the vet…	Optimal-Mail-7349	post	42.29628136551451	female	White	0.999014139175415	na	na	na	6	stress

I'm 21 years old and I recently enrolled in college I ended up choosing a really hard course. My parents were paying for it but i still failed them and i had no choice but to drop the course.  I went to go drop it today however on the way out I got into a fender bender which will be my second accident this year and i'm still on my parents insurance. I'm such a colossal fuckup and I don't know what I can do to repair this situation. I'm going to go get a job soon so the finical strain wont be too hard but I just cant believe how much ive ruined my parents trust they placed in me. The worst part is its all my fault I just cant believe how easy it is to ruin trust and respect and how hard it is to earn it back. I feel paralyzed I cant calm down and this is ontop of the fact that I have anxiety over searching for a job. I threw up due to how stressed I was. I feel like I cant talk to anyone but strangers about how bad i feel right now. I just have no idea how to be ok.	Lord_Jenkum	post	10.226952970655507	male	White	0.999452531337738	na	na	na	3	stress

It sounds like you're doing great, but you had tasked yourself with doing perfect. As if to make up for something, to even things out.

You're okay. How are we supposed to know which courses are too hard without taking them? You're supposed to aim high and fail fast, and move on.

" I (26F), am going through it tonight. Honestly? I couldn't tell if my post belonged in the anxiety or rant subreddit, but I asked myself aloud, ""How do I feel?"", and my answer was: stressed.

So, here I am. 

Crying and bawling my eyes out. 'Why?' you might ask. Well, I'll tell you a little bit about me...I am an overweight female who has gone through shit in my 26 years of living. My childhood was basically robbed of me, mainly because I witnessed fights and screaming matches between family members and a near divorce with the parentals. I was also bullied majority of my early childhood all the way through middle school. After all of this happened (and there was a lot more than that), I felt like I was forced to grow up and basically chose 'flight mode' to save myself.

What I mean by that is, closing myself off. Staying in my room and coming out when I absolutely have to. I have a fear of being rejected, and being a failure. I am afraid of being yelled at for doing something wrong and I have a fear of getting into trouble and being reprimanded.

I still live with my parents and I have no job because of just basically, being socially anxious. I stutter around people I don't know and that makes me even more anxious and self-conscious. I forget things easily and that in turn, furthers my fear of being incapable of a job. On top of that, I have trouble sleeping at night because thoughts run through my head a million times a second. Because of this, I wake up late almost everyday (at 11am).

Just tonight, my mom basically dumped a, 'we need to talk' case on me and already I felt my blood run cold. She's talking to me but all I hear is my heart thumping in my ears. She tells me I need to work on waking up early because the rest of the world wakes up early like ""adults"". I felt very offended by that and told her that it's not my fault that I can't sleep properly at night. I, in fact, tell this to her everyday, so it's not old news. Yet, when I did remind her of this, she basically sighed and almost wanted to roll her eyes. Then she tells me I need a week to just 'work on myself' to fix that and realistically, thats not how that works but I didn't say anything.

Then she tells me I need to find a job. Something that pays and that 70% of the world gets up and does a 9 to 5 job which I already knew. Now, I was starting think she thinks I'm lazy or something when it's absolutely not the case.

Truth is, I have been getting together with my younger sister who is an artist on doing freelance stuff that we are both interested in doing. We have been talking about it little by little. I told my mom this and she didn't seem to believe me, basically looking at me with an expression of, ""Ohhh really like what"".

So she asks, ""Okay, what have y'all worked on today?"" of all things she asks on the day me and my younger sister decide to take at least the day off from planning. I said, ""Well, we are taking a break today but I designed some stuff for xx and sended it to her and she reformatted and polished it up."" my mom seemed to deflate in a way that said, 'That was it?' 

Not gonna lie, it made me feel bad and then she went into a repeated 5 minute lecture on how we need to wake up earlier and start the day like adults. Meanwhile I'm here depressed, stressed and just over it at this point. Over the fact that she just doesn't understand at all. She says, 'I know you can do it. I know that.'

But does she really? Anytime I do, 'do it', she seemes to be unsatisfied and that pushes me a million steps back. 

I get upset and after we finish talking, I go to my room to sleep (11pm at this point) and I just start bawling at how useless I felt and the whole, 'why is my life like this'.

It took so much in me not to burst into tears in front of her but man my throat was tighrening so bad it hurt that I couldn't speak for a good few seconds.

I don't know, I guess I just need some advice on the situation? Anytime I'm in this position my stress literally goes through the roof and I don't know how to manage it (like the need to runaway, disappear or worse). I really do want to work, I want to recieve a paycheck and get my own place and my own car and things, but why am I always on flight mode all the time?"	vniversus	post	16.098247038552174	male	White	0.9866244792938232	na	na	na	3	stress

You could always work a part time job at night or something if you want to do something quick. Working nights can be a little less stressful because you can deal with less people. If that’s not what you’re looking for, I would try finding something meditative to do. For me, I do artwork. Or yoga. I just YouTube beginner yoga. You’ll get past this. Strive to be the best version of yourself, for yourself; but understand yourself and be patient. Maybe do some talk therapy? Just kinda throwing things out there. Journal about it. It sounds like your mom has feelings she doesn’t even understand. Only take what she says with a grain of salt. People sleep on their own schedule, not everyone is an early riser.

I recently lost my apartment due to flooding. I managed to claim from insurance for the (ongoing) restoration works but the whole thing has been so traumatising just going back to the neighbourhood makes my heart sink. I've only bought this apartment 1.5 years ago and it has been endless repairs, plumbing issues and water damage and I really don't want to live there anymore. But it's so hard to rent another place. My parents are completely unsympathetic and won't let me move back with them. I am staying at a hotel for the time being. I have chronic illness and a handful of health issues and this whole thing has aged me 20 years I could see it in the mirror. I have an important interview today but I'm so stressed out I couldn't sleep a wink last night.  To top it off I am on the second day of my period. Please any word to help me relax a little would be greatly appreciated.	xixxexixxxoxx1379	post	38.34187914463752	female	White	0.9992561936378479	na	na	na	4	stress

Like another comment here, deep breaths. But, follow the deep breaths by a short meditation on life as you'd like to see it.

You can and will make it through this, and something that may help will be to practice turning your thoughts and emotions - even in small steps (even 5 minutes a day) - toward a future you'd like to see.

We are amazing beings, with amazing capacity for changing our circumstances; and in the long term it will be accompanied by - possibly initiated by - internal change.

"I struggeled with this habit for years. Over the time I noticed the link between the skin picking and my mental health. When I'm less stressed, it's easier for me not to do it. 

What helps me with open wounds is putting bandaids around my fingers. And in general also hand cream. That way your skin remains smooth and soft. Everytime I feel the urge to pick, I put on some cream and massage it in. I also started filing my nails and putting on nail polish - that tends to keep me away from doing it, since I want my hands to look pretty.

I honestly tried so many different things and nothing really helped until I started taking more care of my mental health. I don't know if you're habit is linked to that as well, but you may want to get to the root of the cause, if that's also the case for you :)"	Gullible_Educator678	reply	na	na	na	0.988032341003418	no	strong	no	na	stress
"A friend of mine said that after the pandemic, he's started to budget a lot less to spend more money on travelling. His belief is, what's the point of saving if we all die! Funnily enough, before the pandemic, he was a cheapskate always saving and thinking long-term. Interesting to see him have changed this much.

A part of me agrees, and of course, disagrees. For me, I have started to find different things important that weren't so before, going out for dinner with friends, and prioritising experiences over materialistic goods. Crazy to think that 2 years went by in our lives that we'll never get back and how it changed our lives and will most likely impact how we think about how we spend our money and manage it forever in the future.

Digestion is highly influenced by stress. Best thing is to reduce stress of course. It’s also important to stay hydrated to keep things moving. Finally, moving around (walking, running, exercise) helps the bowels directly and reduces stress.	laguitarcia	reply	na	na	na	0.9813599586486816	no	no	no	na	stress
I was having similar pains for several months and thought it was stress based digestive issues because my stress definitely does mess with my digestion, though never like that before. It got increasingly worse and when I finally got checked out, it turned out it was kidney stones and an ovarian cyst. How I got both at the same time, idk, but the cyst burst and I was bleeding internally by the time they found it. I do still get twinges in my lower abdomen occasionally and was told to see my doctor right away if it gets bad again. Anyway, idk if you are an ovary having person, but cysts can happen in other lower abdomen equipment as well, and kidney stones can present with pain in the lower abdomen, so you should probably get checked out.	laguitarcia	reply	na	na	na	0.9813599586486816	no	strong	no	na	stress

Literally dealing with this again as we speak lol. It’s defffffinitely all connected - something my pelvic floor therapist taught me. I’ve had the most issues during the most stressful jobs I’ve worked. Unfortunately, not a lot helped me (even taking miralax).  All I could do is try to avoid eating in the morning or at other irregular times for me, so that my stomach would be empty and also devoid of any digestive issues. Cut down on caffeine and increase water intake. The most helpful thing was when my life circumstances/job changed to be less stressful.

"If you can, try to have some fun or do something to take your mind of the stress. And every time the stress comes back exercise, watch tv, sing a song or something else to stop a stress loop from starting. 

I had a similar path to what you described. Lots of low paying jobs for the first 10 years of my career. I could barely save, even though I was pretty frugal. But then I changed career and things started improving. If you told me where I would be now in my mid 30s, I would never have believed it.

So I wanted to get a better grasp on this concept because there are times when I am stressed yet still maintaining a fairly healthy mindset. There are other times I *feel* less stressed out but I am not healthy and my mentality is worn down. How do you keep a clear distinction between the two when there is so much stimulation, distractions and stressors in life? I want to have a clear understanding of myself and how I function for longevity reasons.

"TL;DR: Can't sleep due to stress. Example for today is waiting on a person to send their part of a group project and it likely won't be sent until the morning but can't turn off my brain to sleep tonight because I want to finish all objective for today and then I can sleep. Need help to fix this way of thinking.

Whenever I become stressed I either don't sleep or keep on waking up every hour roughly for a good while and then ultimately wake up in the morning absolutely exhausted. Take today for example I'm laying in bed stressed over a college assignment because I'm still waiting for one member to send his part to me so it can be added to the PowerPoint. It's due tomorrow evening and instead of just accepting I'll have to wait for it to be sent to me tomorrow morning or afternoon all I can think is ""I want to have it now so I can finish the project and then turn my brain off."" I can't turn my brain off until all objectives are done for that day. The objective was to submit this group project and since how I can't do it I've started stressing out and thus now I can't sleep.

I feel this. Work always occupies my mind when I’m trying to shut down and sleep. In a situation like yours, I’d just remind yourself that you can’t control when someone sends in their part, and you still have all day tomorrow to get it added. If it makes you feel better, you could send a quick text reminder that you need their part by noon tomorrow or something. Also, melatonin sometimes helps me, and it doesn’t make me feel like trash the next day. Good luck and sweet dreams (hopefully!)

"Sounds like you could have high cortisol which is affecting your melatonin production.  Seems like work is probably the issue.  Like so the thought of work is overwhelming you to the point you are becoming stressed.  I think really you need to manage this stress as I would suspect this is negatively impacting your work.

To me, it sounds like something like morning meditation might help to make you more focused for work.  You should also try organizing your time better so you are keeping up with your work but you also are giving yourself time to relax and wind down you should find this helps.  I mean I don't think I'm too different I work like 7 days a week whenever I can.

Really I get quite sluggish and could get a lot more done I think.  If I ever go out for the weekend or anything it can be absolute hell with my backlog of work.  I know what you mean about not being able to sleep because of being stressed.

Probably try lay of the coffee and stuff after a certain time.  Also if you want to try a supplement to see if it helps maybe check this one out.

I would say you are not a failure, and your toughness is sufficient...the only way to be a failure and not tough enough is to make the worst possible choice to end it...stay focused on you and get professional help...it sounds like your father is unaware of his emotional abuse as well...if he truly cares for you he will be part of the solution not the problem...

"I know stress can cause a lack of appetite, but can it cause hunger signals to disappear entirely?

I have been dealing with an extremely stressful situation lately (on a waiting list for therapy atm). The stress has been making me feel I’ll (mostly low energy, sore/achy, headaches and stomach pain). 

I’m used to losing my appetite when stressed or grieving, but with this situation I haven’t even been feeling hungry. Like, I’ll go straight from fine to “my stomach hurts and is growling from being empty” with no warning. At the point when my stomach starts hurting, I force myself to eat something but it is difficult since my appetite is gone so nothing sounds good and it seems counterintuitive to eat when I feel nauseous. When I am able to eat, it is much less than I normally would. 

Is this a normal stress thing, and how can I deal with this without making myself sicker or ending up with an ulcer?"	Kind_Dot_2591	post	24.66964027132058	female	White	0.9979919195175171	na	na	na	2	stress
"Stress means that our body is out of balance. Biologically speaking, our body is an intelligent organism. Every tissue in its organs strive to stay alive. When we are under immense stress, the tissues in our body try to protect themselves by conserving energy and going on a fasting mode. They will do these until they no longer feel threatened and homeostasis is once again restored.

Listen to your body. It will tell you how to take care of it. If you feel thirsty, drink water with electrolytes. If you feel a pang of hunger, eat healthy food, such as fruits and vegetables. Junk foods (i.e., sugar and carbs) would only make your stress level go up even more, so avoid them. If you are sleepy, just go to bed and lie down until you fall asleep. Let your body’s natural responses to stress guide you to your wellness. Hope this help explain it."	Kind_Dot_2591	reply	na	na	na	0.9979919195175171	no	strong	no	na	stress
I had this happen to me for quite a while during a very extended period of severe stress, so I do (personally) believe that stress can cause you to miss the early signs of hunger. When I had an incident where I didn't eat for 2 days and ended up getting sick, I downloaded an app that allowed me to set certain times to eat, and it sent push notifications to my phone. I coupled that with a stash of protein bars in my office so even if I really couldn't break away to go make a sandwich or heat up leftovers, at least I could get something in me.

"Yeah stress affects your immune system. If you don’t sleep good then your body won’t repair as fast as it would in a relaxed state…

I will sound like a broken record here mate. But here goes…
If you can’t sleep, write down all your worries and things you have to do tomorrow then go to sleep. The list will be there in the morning. Listen to boring podcasts to get to sleep. 
Worry / anxiety -if it’s something outside your control, stop thinking about it. If it’s something you can do something about, stop worrying and do the thing you need to do. 
Meditate. 
Eat fresh foods. 
Cut right back on sugar, coffee and alcohol.

I would recommend looking at options to supplement your physio treatment. Thomas Hanna somatics helped me the most, there are a lot of good Youtube videos from [Essential Somatics](https://essentialsomatics.com/). In my case, my knee issue was related to tension in my core and back. Theory goes that all issues start in the core which is highly susceptible to stress and a sedentary life style.

"I (20s/F) have everything I could possibly want. I have a house in a nice area, an amazing fiancé that I can’t wait to start a family with, a well paying job… but I feel like I’ve been going insane. 

I’m sleep deprived, can’t take care of myself, can’t be there for my family, fiancé, take care of my house, still wish my fiancé would’ve wanted to elope because I have hated wedding planning cause of my stress and anxiety, and just feel like I’m failing no matter how hard I try. 

I’ve been in this line of work for a few years now, and I have awful anxiety about it, and sometimes it just feels like nothing is worth it …and now that I even have the things I wanted in life, I still don’t want to be here. 

I dual majored in engineering and have worked in the auto industry since I was 18. Due to graduating right when covid hit, I lost all my interview for dream positions, and somehow ended up in supervisor/operations roles at plants. I am extremely thankful for the experience I’ve gotten (I genuinely believe I can do anything after this) and now am doing it with the company I wanted to work for and am on a good shift now instead of night shift. I work my butt off, always have… cause I feel like I’m this industry if I’m not the best I’ll be considered the “bimbo female hire”. I have a lot of support from higher ups and constantly get told I’ll be able to move onto a more technical role outside of the plants sooner than late so it feels like there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. However, some days it feels like it’s never going to end… 60+ hour weeks, constant overtime, you receive crap from hourly and the salary above you, pretty hostile work environment, the building should be condemned how nasty and unsanitary it is… you name it. Half the stuff that’s said or done would be HR fireable offenses at the offices. You just become just as crappy if you’re there long enough too. I have constant breakdowns and then feel guilty for feeling that way. I just feel hopeless. Seeing my coworkers getting stuck/held back is adding major fuel to the fire as well.

I feel like everything I’m going through started when I went to my nephrologist and learned that my kidney function is lowering and my bp has raised. He put me on losartan 25 mg and I feel as if it’s ruining my whole life. At first it was the headaches, everyday I would get one. Then the tinnitus came and now I had ringing in my ears. Then after that I noticed my vision felt weird (I would mess up reading) and I got a bunch of floaters, I went to the eye doctor and she said that my eyes were fine. Then I started feeling very stupid like I couldn’t understand anything. It’s like everything I would hear would go in one ear and out the other. When reading questions in a test I would have to re-read multiple times to actually understand it. I was already stressed with my health issues and taking almost all AP classes has made it many times worse. I want to try the best I can but I just don’t feel like trying anymore. I’ve always wanted to be the best and I’ve always been “Smart” but now I feel so slow and I can’t focus. I don’t want to disappoint my parents but I don’t think I can do this. Am I just imagining everything or is something really wrong? I’m only 16 and I feel like I’m already losing my future because of this.	peepeepoopoo1937	post	10.758285919706644	female	White	0.9993828535079956	na	na	na	1	stress

She’s so stressed because of her dad and studies.

w/ Dad:

My girlfriend's family is in incredible debt right now because of her dad, they own a small store that sells daily needs. Her dad drinks EVERY NIGHT and he gets the alcohol they drink from their store, and expects her mother to pay for the alcohol. Her dad also loans a shit ton of money from loaning centers.

w/ studies:

She's in her 3rd year of college right now and apparently in one of her subjects, they only have 2 exams per semester and she's failed both of those exams, last Tuesday was the second and it's been fucking her up so much. She did an assignment, a plate (cause she's in engineering), she asked from another block what the problem was 3 days ago, but she found out this afternoon from her classmate that the professor changed one detail in the problem that would change the ENTIRE equation, she couldn't pass it in time.

I'm talking to her now but I don't know what to say anymore, I've said everything that I could.

"Hi all. 

I’ve just started my first job out of uni in a very high stress field with strict timelines (m&a). I’ve noticed that when I send out emails, I overthink and stress over every little bit (aka am I spelling names correctly, does it make sense) to the point I’m wasting time. When I do send out ‘wrong’ emails (aka it double sent or some wires were crossed) I freak out and get way too much adrenaline - I feel like I’ll puke and I get very warm. I know I won’t lose my job over this but I can’t help but overthink. It’s literally to the point that I’m wondering whether this is the right field for me even though I really do like my job.

"You absolutely should make sure that you have spelled names correctly and that your email makes sense. I wouldn't think of this as pointless worrying, it's fairly fundamental. Checking the spelling of a name takes maybe 10 seconds and IMO is common courtesy. 


I'm a manager in a consulting firm and I'm always telling my team that it does no harm to take a few minutes to proof read what you've written before sending, better to take an extra few minutes and get it right, especially when you are starting out. 


It is something which I've found comes with time and experience. I know starting out it maybe took me 15 minutes to compile and send an email which would now take a couple of minutes. Might be worth getting your superiors to cast their eyes across any emails which are of high importance while you're getting to grips with it, I found this kind of input reassuring and helpful at the start of my career.

I haven't come across any email classes but I would advise being a ""sponge"". Really pay attention to how other people communicate and soak it all up. It's the best way to learn and I feel working from home during covid has made learning like this a lot harder. So if you are wfh but are able to, try and get into the office too. 

I would also get someone more senior to read your emails. I typically get my associates to draft client emails and then I'd red line with updates I would make.

"To be an effective communicator, through written emails or verbally is an important skillset to acquire, and good topic to ask for mentorship and tips on!

As he is quite senior he will have seen a lot of emails and will be able to feedback on this with colourful examples 😁

Within the mentor conversation, you can express safely your stress or concerns in written communication and emails and get specific help. Maybe he can set you an assignment or a challenge to complete next time you meet. So get that appointment in and get that support 💪

Living in our head, keeps us in our head and stops us from living or moving forward. It's difficult to stop stressing about the future and the what ifs but if you can create small goals that take you to the bigger goals it will all feel more manageable.

Luckily, I tested negative for covid but after talking to my doctor it appears I have a bad flu or some kind of viral infection. I live around 4.5 hours away from university and my dad picked me up and drove me home as soon as I had the covid scare so I wouldn't have to quarantine in the Quarantine and Isolation Housing dorm. I'm staying home for the week to recover from whatever I have and to see my doctor in person.   
My professors all let me know what I'd be missing and where I can access work so I don't fall behind. It's so great to see my family again but I'm melancholy because I'm so stressed about missing school and sports practice plus my car and most of my belongings are at my school. The health center, res life, and the dean's office all know the situation but I'm worried that me missing class will come back to bite me when I return to school. College was already extremely stressful for me, especially with my busy sports schedule where I practice 3 nights in a row from 11 pm-12:30 am.

"Hey guys!

These past 2 months have been very exhausting for me because I've been having gastrointestinal problems that just don't go away. I went to 2 different doctors and they give me medication and it's 80% ok while I take it but when I come off of them the symptoms  appear again. I have stomach acid and I had some gallbladder problems, now I think I've developed IBS. I'm planning to go see a doctor again next week.

I am really stressed and I feel burned-out because I do everything right and they don't want to go away. 

My hope is that it will get better after I move out for college on Sunday but that may not fix it, and there is a chance it will be worse.

Sorry to hear you are having such problems, there are many factors that could play a part, including medical conditions, diet/nutrition and certainly stress. Stress and certainly prolonged stress can affect all of the systems of the body, including digestion. In essence the body prioritizes resources for immediate survival and functions such as digestion and reproduction are low on the immediate survival priority list. Unaddressed stress is equivalent to the body being in constant survival mode. Although, the GP can certainly look at possible medical conditions, other areas such as nutrition and stress management strategies may prove beneficial.	aSincereLemon	reply	na	na	na	0.9981569647789001	strong	no	no	na	stress

"I can't communicate. My brain is fried.

It's a little easier writing then speaking. 

I'm pronouncing words wrong.

I am mostly communicating with my mom and she is so hard to talk to she cuts you off, gets upset if you dont agree and then never understands and so maybe I'm just so incredibly stressed because my subconscious is already expecting something strainous with communicating with her. 

Shes also over communicating like, I'm not getting any continuous space of silence from communication for a good period of time any day of the week. 

Which is not her fault but she does keep telling me things that are unnecessary like how she is going to go pick up the dog poop. I dont need a play by play of every single minor action. 

I need my brain to function a little better. 

But the forgetting what I am completely saying mid sentence do I have something wrong with my brain.

"Everyone has different stress triggers. Work stress tops the list, according to surveys. Life stresses can also have a big impact

What causes stress depends, at least in part, on your perception of it. Something that’s stressful to you may not faze someone else; they may even enjoy it. While some of us are terrified of getting up in front of people to perform or speak, for example, others live for the spotlight. Where one person thrives under pressure and performs best in the face of a tight deadline, another will shut down when work demands escalate. And while you may enjoy helping to care for your elderly parents, your siblings may find the demands of caretaking overwhelming and stressful.

There are various techniques (stress management techniques and relaxation techniques) for managing stress. These can be helpful when you're going through worrying times, at home or work, or facing particular challenges that make you stressed.

"I'm already spread thin and stressed to the max.  My husband is out of town for two weeks for family reasons and I feel overwhelmed with everything. We also haven't been apart for more than a few days in 9 years.

The last few says have been especially rough. I've been having to drive home in the middle of the day to let our dog out and and give her meds. We have opposite schedules so he usually does those things before he goes to work. I don't always find parking again when I get back from taking care of her either. We adopted another dog right before he left too which I was hesitant to do. In just 3 days he's already needed to go to the vet twice. Once to look at his neuter incision and again later this week for what appears to be allergies or a virus. We have another dog who's been with us since before we got married. She's undergoing chemo treatment but is doing well. I worry about her catching something if he's sick. I've been sleeping on the couch the past few nights to keep him apart from her because she sleeps in our bedroom and he doesn't need to be jumping on the bed. He also wakes himself and me up multiple times a night because of his stuffy nose. On top of all that, I ran over a bunch of nails in the road and of course one got into my tire. I'm also struggling with school right now.

I'm stressed and frustrated all around. My husband left to his dad's home country to bury him and spend two weeks with his family there. I'm glad he was able to go, but I feel bad that part of me is upset with him about leaving this long. I took on all the responsibilities we share plus extra so he could go. He hasn't even been gone a week yet. I don't know how I'm going to keep everything up until he gets back. My stress management techniques are poor.

Crate train the new dog so they will sleep separately and not bother you or the other dog.

Try and flip the script on your current perspective. Shit happens, and when it rains it pours. Your husband will get back and he will be grateful for all the hard work you put in to allow him to go be with his family. Try to laugh and take notice of the positive things that happen even if they are tiny. You probably wouldn’t feel frustrated with your husband if things had been going smoother so try not to hold it against him because it sounds like the source of your frustration is being caused by mostly things outside of anyones control (although I understand where your coming from and those emotions are valid). I’m currently home alone with our dogs while the wife is out of state for the exact same reasons as your husband. I don’t have quite as much on my plate right now as you but I just wanted to say I understand how you are feeling ! Also I’ll repeat the good advice. Do the bear  minimum until you feel like your heads back above water. Eat fast food, save the chores for later, do something for yourself!

“My husband left to his dad’s home country to bury him”.    Umm - you’re his spouse right?  Supporting your spouse through the loss of his parents is one of those Things You Signed Up For.  Your comments don’t ring true.  You’re upset because of the dogs?  Because you can’t find parking?  Because of school?  It sounds like maybe you’re stressed out because your husband is in a not great spot, you are used to being able to depend on him, and you can’t right now.  Maybe you’re anxious about being alone.

"Dealing with this alone can be very frustrating. Especially when your own family shows so little understanding.  
Let's not get into that. That was not your question.  
To your first point. Because you tell your self you are not good enough.  
This should also help with your third point.

Learn to rate your behavior,  not your self: 

&#x200B;

Goal  
This tool aims to help clients differentiate between rating the self and rating behaviour with regards to past mistakes and regrettable actions.  
Instructions  
We all make mistakes, and we all do things that we are not proud of from time to time. However, the way in which people evaluate their mistakes or regrettable actions can differ. While some people may see such actions as proof of being a “flawed” or “unworthy” human being, others may see them as inevitable occurrences that are merely a part of being human. In this exercise, you will explore these two ways of evaluating mistakes or regrettable actions.  
Step 1: Identify past mistakes  
Make a list of 5-10 things in your past that you are not proud of or that you wish you did differently. For example, you may have forgotten a close friend’s birthday, or said something unkind to someone, or became overly angry at some driver, or made a mistake, or treated someone unfairly. List each of these past regrets in the first column in the table below.  
Step 2: Evaluate yourself as a person  
For each of the actions listed in the first column, evaluate yourself as a person for making the mistake. What personal characteristics could explain the mistake? Write down this global evaluation of yourself in the second column.  
Step 3: Evaluate your behaviour  
Now, in the third column, evaluate your behaviour with regards to the mistake. What actions or behaviours could explain the mistake?  
What do I mean by that? Below is a super simple example of this:  
Past mistake or regrettable action: I forgot my friend’s birthday  
Evaluation of the self: I am a lousy friend; I am careless  
Evaluation of behaviour: Forgetting the birthday was not very thoughtful of me  
Step 4: Reflection  
■ How was it to do this exercise?  
■ Do you feel differently about yourself when you consider your responses in the second column versus  
the third column? If so, how?  
■ Which responses (second or third column) are more motivating in terms of improving yourself to do  
better next time?  
■ Going forward, will you aim to evaluate yourself or your behaviour with regards to mistakes or regrettable  
behaviour? Why?

Why do you tell yourself you are not good enough?  
Are these hidden expectations from others?

**Because of alcohol:**

&#x200B;

How does alcohol affect stress? Alcohol affects the messenger substances in your brain and slows down the flow of information between the cells. The effect: You feel more relaxed than before. In addition, your body releases more dopamine under the influence of alcohol.  
This is what makes it so ""pleasant"" to drink alcohol under stress.

This is what makes it so ""pleasant"" to drink alcohol under stress.  
If you have a drink, that's okay. However, your body has the habituation effect.  
So you would have to drink more and more for the same effect!  
So you need alternatives. Affirmations are not always helpful.   
That's why it's okay to leave them out.

"I hope I'm not on the wrong subreddit for this question.

Kind of talking about like the quote, 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger' or something like that.

I'm not sure, but I feel like I don't cope with stress too well. I can manage to study for long hours without tears or anything, but that is in the past. I feel like these days I'm feeling the pressure. 

I have a feeling that if I fail a question or something like that I just start to contemplate my life even after the exam. Even like I would get on the verge of tears if I didn't know something. Like if I fail the exam, I don't have good grades, then I don't go to a good university, then I don't get a job or either I get a job with little pay, people make fun of me, etc.

Honestly makes me feel anxious, but even if I have coping techniques sometimes I still really wish I could just put myself into extremely stressful environments. But not like life-threatening events, I just want to put myself under immense, crippling stress when I do everyday basic things (like practicing an exam paper, or cleaning within a time limit). 

Sometimes I feel that its necessary for me to just stress myself out 24/7, then after that I'll develop a good stress tolerance or something like that. I just really wished I were one of those people who are extremely good at managing stress, and never shed a tear in a very long time (and I mean, years).

To be honest, I know its sounds like I'm really self-sabotaging, but no matter how much I really want to pressure myself to the extremes, I have a feeling it probably isn't right for me. But then again, there's people around me (especially on the internet) who study for hours, or work for many hours, and probably do well under pressure.

Just hope someone would answer this question for me."		post	7.519433118226667	female	White	0.9888525009155273	na	na	na	3	stress
"Interesting question. Stress can be Good and positive and motivate you. It can give you that kind of extra focus and motivation. This is called „Eustress“.

You mentioned you could study for long hours. This is great. While reading this I was wondering when do you take a break?

You also mentioned in your text, from people from the Internet you read that they study for hours. 

This statement shows that you are in a comparison. Here you can only lose. 
There is always someone who will learn more than you. 

The question is, is this person better in the exam than you? 

The really exciting question is, what does it feel good for you to learn? 

How can you best plan your time to learn a lot? 

Do you reflect on yourself at the end of the day? What did you learn today? 

How does it make you feel?

This will help you focus on yourself and your positive successes. 

You may not be the type to study for 3-4 hours at a time. 

Maybe you need a break after 45 minutes. 

That's fine, it's about your result, not something else.

If you have too much stress for too long, the consequences are rather negative. 

You will think you always have too little time and will therefore want to accomplish even more. 

But you achieve the opposite. You need longer for your tasks while your performance decreases. 

Now a downward spiral begins. The highest level is burnout. 

May I ask what coping techniques you know? 

It seems to be very important for you to do well in the exams.

Why is that? What is the most mature motivation behind it? 

Your focus seems to be on the negative, without meaning that in a bad way. 

What if it works out and you do well? 

These are just a few impulses, without being able to make all the connections. 

I am curious about your feedback."		reply	na	na	na	0.9888525009155273	weak	no	strong	na	stress
"There are different types of stress - from unstable situations, perceived threats and danger, fear and uncertainty, to more immediate physical stress like being too cold or hot, from exercise or injury, etc. the body can only handle so much stress at a time and needs time to recover. 

So dousing one self with general stress doesn’t necessarily increase stress tolerance. It is better to identify the specific source of stress and try to address that. 

From what you wrote the main source of stress seems to be overthinking of the consequences of small results (answer to one question) into catastrophic future scenarios. I would start from there and look up ways to reduce overthinking, catastrophic thinking (actual term), and things along those lines."		reply	na	na	na	0.9888525009155273	no	no	no	na	stress
"1) My definition of studying for long hours is studying for more than 4 hours. If I study for long hours, I usually take a break after 2-3 hours. There are occasions where I studied for more than 4 hours, which is my birthday (last year, about 6 hours, straight without breaks), and this year's summer. I remember studying for 8-9 hours (with breaks) within 3 days and it was exhausting if I were to be completely honest. But it kind of amazes me how people can study for many hours, whereas I can't. Also if I don't get enough sleep it means I'll be consuming all the instant coffee packs I have in the house.  
  
2) I usually think if others study for really long hours, I just **assume** they are better in the exam than me. However, most of what I see (the people working for long hours) is a time lapse of their timer mostly, and not their exam results posted on the internet. I also want to note out that most of what I see is on Tiktok anyway (called 'studytok') where a lot of the content as I observed is of aesthetic study notes (which I especially don't have, because I don't use highlighters and colors in my notes a lot, its very plain), nice desks (my desk is just a wooden one and theres no billboard or notes on the wall), and getting high grades (usually 8 or 9s). Occasionally those posts is also either study motivation posts (which show you pictures of study aesthetic or time lapses, or quotes), or its either that sometimes people say stuff like 'Grades don't define you' (very hard to believe that).

I also get a lot of these study timelapses (and what they call 'grinds) from them. The rest would probably be from Youtube (e.g: 'How I got all A Stars / Grade 9s on GCSE').   
  
3) If I were to answer what feels good for me to learn (as in what I like to learn), it would be subjects like History, Maths, and English. Art is what I like the most especially as a child, but its mostly a hobby (I still chose it for GCSEs though, but I won't be taking it for A-levels). It might be odd for me to enjoy Maths because I didn't like it at all when I was a child, but after my last year Maths teacher told about maths, I kind of started to get more interested in it (especially the financial aspects). She answered a lot of my questions too so I eventually understood the importance of understanding maths and not just memorizing it. I like it the most when I am able to understand something. However, maths mistakes also hit me a lot harder than if I got a mistake in science or english (if I got a maths question wrong I even start questioning my life choices and myself as a person, like saying things to myself like 'Maybe I'm not this personality thats why I'm not good at maths' or 'Well, I'm just not cut out for it unlike others'. It sounds debiliating but I think that way). 

Right now my family is still teaching me maths (1-2 hour a day, related to GCSE Subjects) even after I come back home from school lessons. I also attend afterschool classes almost everyday.  
  
4) 'How can you best plan your time to learn a lot?' I am not sure how to answer that question other than a basic schedule and expectations (e.g: Learn Maths for 2 hours a day). However theres sometimes things that pop up that interrupt such as house chores, and friends messaging me (I have 2 close friends from my old school) so I sometimes think I need to reserve a time for things like these. If I don't have a schedule though, I usually stick to goals (e.g: Study Biology Unit 5 for 30 minutes, study Chemistry Unit 6 for 45 minutes, answer 1 exam paper for GCSE English Language).  
  
5) I don't regularly reflect on myself at the end of the day. I usually go straight to my phone or go to sleep at the end of the day, but occasionally I also sometimes think of embarassing moments which keep me up awake for a few minutes. Additionally, I sometimes plan a very specific time for me to go to sleep (e.g: I will sleep at 9:00pm) but then I get distracted easily by phone, or I either worry about school work and end up sleeping late (like last week).  
  
6) I think what I do at the end of the day makes me feel like I'm just waiting for a time when I actually will get a good schedule for myself. I have this feeling to follow things like retrospective timetable, or notion schedules. Retrospective timetable seems a little complicated for me. I also prefer a regular schedule where I study a subject for a certain amount of time and at a specific time of day). While I have Notion, I just used it to store links of specifications on GCSE Exams so I don't forget what I need to include in my answers during the exam. However I don't use Notion for a schedule daily. I used to but not anymore. All I left on the app was study playlists, and a template for how well I did in each GCSE Exam (which is empty, however my mocks are coming up this November-December).  
  
7) Coping techniques I know are the following: Meditation (used to do this, usually I do this before studying to clear my mind, and sometimes after), listening to cat sounds when I'm studying (since it helps reduce stress for me), but in extreme cases of stress I use a rubber band and slap it on my wrist multiple times. And I also sometimes slap a ruler on my face multiple times. I didn't do like that this week but around last week I did something like that, but its lesser now.  
  
8) I need to get good grades to get to A-Levels (A-Level Maths require Grade 7 and above in my school), and I need the A-Levels to relate to my future career (Accounting). I used to have Artist as a future career but I completely discarded it as I don't want to turn what I like into a career (plus my mother said its not a real job). Just seems like I will hate it when its forced, and in Art GCSE time really matters. In my case I'm quite slow at drawing and I focus on a lot of small details when I draw, so its very time-consuming. My opinion on Maths is that I don't really hate Maths, but I don't massively like it either (it is not a passion of mine), however it is tolerable as there are some aspects of Maths I'm interested in, and its a fact that Maths is everywhere anyway, which makes it one of the most useful A levels, so I don't really see a point in including creative subjects like Art into A-Levels. I also had a regret of choosing Art over ICT. I think this means I have to learn computing on my own because accountancy requires that. Plus I want all my A-Levels to be career-related. I want to have A-Level Maths and if it was possible A-Level Business or A-Level Accountancy. However one slot is left and I'm struggling to see if I really need a science (I'm aiming for Physics or Chemistry but I'm not too good at Physics) or if I go on to take English Literature or History instead. The reason I'm discussing A-levels now is because my school is encouraging this, slots fill up easily. So by January I have to decide what I want for A-levels.   
  
As for motivation, the reason behind succeeding my exams is for one reason, to just get A-Levels, and then eventually get to a university, get a good degree, and a job. I think a lot of the reasons are probably just career-related or the reason is simply to get a decent job with a decent salary. I sometimes feel I'm overly focused on getting a job, but I just don't want to be poor even if I'm not gonna leave my house very early (I don't want to leave at about 18 or so, and I don't even know when I'm ready to live alone since its still far). I don't come from a poor background though, but I still just want to get a stable job because I believe if I ever start living independently I'll have to get a job first, and there are a lot of things that you have to pay if you live alone (like rent bills, water bills, or groceries and more). Sometimes though there are flucuations in the economy so it would affect the prices of daily needs for living so I still need to prepare for that (even though I am not an adult yet, money is important).  
  
9) If it works out and I do well, I get quite happy and satisfied about it (not in a very show way, I don't jump or scream if I do well in a test, but just feel satisfied). However, after that I just remind myself that it will get harder from now on, because if I pass GCSE Exams I'll have to go to A-level, and the content learned in A-Levels is a lot harder and complex than GCSE.

"Like the post says, i just have actual tangible problems i have to deal with day in and day out. The biggest problem is everyone involved in my life is some how apart of some of the problems so there is no one i can talk to all of it about. I hope that made sense, and if not it should after I explain it. 

Ill just list them plainly
We had to dig into savings and spend 5k on car repairs 

Came home to my roomate screaming at his ex girlfriend so i got in the middle of it and told her she doesnt have to deal with him again. i had to kick him out and thought i was gunna have to fight him in a bathroom 

My wife is getting a series of MRI to see if she will need brain surgery 

I take my grandfather for serious surgery oct 7th

My mom is taking my other grandfather to get his other leg amputated an a month in a half

My stepdad’s business is only breaking even this year and my mom isn’t handling it well so i cant really tell her about any of my problems 

I would tell my buddy about my problems but he is having major issues 
With his wife and will prob get divorced in 5 years so he isnt in a place to hear my bullshit

I work for myself so my job is inherently stressful day in and day out.

And now im here typing all this on reddit bc i havent slept in 2 days bc every time i go to lay down my brain does the math on bill i already know i have money for over and over again. 

TLDR i have a lot of problems cant tell anyone about and just stressed out. Its cool to ask me literally anything if anyone has actually read this. Just figuring out what to do with the extra 8 hours i get a day now. My life isnt bad and we arent homeless or addicts or anything. Just a lot of stuff outside my control i have to grind and deal with every day. I with I actually had interpersonal problems to deal with instead of this shit honestly.

"Hi, this is a tough question. Mindfulness is really very general.  
It's important to figure out what your warning signs and symptoms are when you're stressed.   
Have you ever done a stress test to figure these out??  
If you want to practice mindfulness, one  way is through your breathing. If you control your breathing, you control your stress and vice versa.  
Below are 2 simple breathing exercises that you can do quickly.   
1 Minute Breath Control  
Set a stopwatch for 1 minute.  
Let your breath flow in its rhythm.  
Count your breaths. Inhale and exhale count as 1 breath.  
How many breaths do you take in 1 minute?  
9-12 very relaxed  
up to 15 still okay  
from 16 stressed  
The fewer breaths you take, the more relaxed you are.  
4-7-8 Breathing  
Helps you with:  
Reducing anxiety  
Problems falling asleep   
Controlling cravings  
Control or reduce anger reactions  
Before you begin the breathing pattern, assume a comfortable sitting position and place the tip of your tongue on the area directly behind your upper front teeth.  
To apply the 4-7-8 technique, focus on the following breathing pattern:  
First, exhale deeply. Then inhale calmly through the nose for 4 seconds.  
Hold the breath for 7 seconds  
Exhale forcefully through the mouth for 8 seconds, tightening the lips slightly  
Repeat the cycle up to 4 times

As others have said, do not give up on finding the right doctor. At the same time, I wonder if your psoas and/or iliacus muscles are contributing to the issue. Psoas is a large muscle that connects the upper body to the lower body. It generally gets very sore from sitting around a lot. I also find that when I get stressed this muscle group tends to get tense. The good news is that there are a lot of simple movements you can find on Youtube to release these muscles. Active isolated stretching works best (only stretching for 2 seconds as stretching for longer than 30 seconds kicks off the stretch reflex). I have had something similar and doctors generally never consider this. Worth a look and should not do any damage.	DesperateScore4622	reply	na	na	na	0.999381422996521	no	no	no	na	stress
